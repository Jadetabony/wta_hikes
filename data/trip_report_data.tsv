Rattlesnake Ledge	ninjaracerchick	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Got on trail around 7, finally decided to check this one off my list because I wanted something close to town and not too long. Great little climb, and a good work out. Tread is easy and you can tell lots of work was done to make it smooth. Did have to pass quite a few disrespectful hikers, another reason I avoid these close easier hikes, loud music not sharing the trail etc... went to the main ledge and climbed up to the upper ledge	Aug 16, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-16.0369866109
Sumner Link Trail	Naturegym	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Very short distance. Signage is poor so if parking according to wta directions, you either end up in downtown Sumner or at the 410 bridge within 5 minutes and no signage to give further directions. Having gps is helpful. The Riverside Trail on the opposite side of the river was much better. They are all paved and great for strollers and family walk. 	Aug 16, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-16.9743997351
Alger Alp (South Route)	nrthpole	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	August 16th, 2018 Arrived  0830 at Squire lake parking lot and I was the only vehicle. Hiked up to Squire Lake then Squire lake loop trail heading south where I then followed South Ridge Trail to the park boundary. I believe this is part of the PNWST (Pacific Northwest Scenic Trail). Eventually will turn into logging road that leads to logging road 1300. Stay on logging road 1300 until you see road 1000. there is a visible sign. Hike that to the end  (Alger Alp).  Im 62 years old and made it to the summit in about an hour and 15 minutes. Took in the view had a little bit to eat then headed back down via the Squires Lake loop trail.  I was at my car at 1130. Parking lot had 4 cars at that time.  but never ran into anyone except one girl walking her 3 big dogs around the lake. Enjoyable  morning. Not to many views. Road 1000 is a little steep but smooth and wide. (No roots or big rocks to step over) Just pace yourself. Or run if you can.

Dosewallips State Park - Steam Donkey Trail	cholcomb	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Lots of roots and large rocks, would be careful with young kids. 	Aug 16, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-16.8954162869
Old Man's Trail	EmilB	Obstacles on trail:	    Trees down across trail.	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	- Plenty of Sky Country parking at 10 AM on a cool, foggy Thursday. - The Nike meadow looked like a pen of small clouds. - Last night (8/15) a tree fell over the Nike Horse trail, just south of the meadow.  (But, no one is out there in a wheel chair or bicycle, so it's no big deal.) - If you haven't taken the   out of the lot, please give it a try.  The only quick round-trip back is Clay Pit Road (which for a stretch is in front of a housing development, outside the entry gate), but the trail has a lovely fall-away ravine view and a log bridge; which are the two most exciting things that close to the parking lot. Per Garmin,  .   Every stretch of the figure-8-shaped lot is a one-way (see the attached picture).  Directionality is indicated with traffic signs and pavement arrows.  However, people frequently drive against the one-ways.  We’ve all disregarded parking lot traffic signs, but the lot has blind corners that are only safe when directionality is followed.  I have seen people charging excitedly into the parking lot and around blind corners with the confidence they have the right-of-way to the whole lane.  I have also seen people in a hurry to get home drive furiously around the same blind corners the wrong way.  At some point, people will collide.  So, do not be one of those people; recognize that, once you are in the parking lot, Mad Max rules apply and drive cautiously around every corner assuming someone could be hurtling against the one-way toward you.

Bald Mountain	Pribbs	Obstacles on trail:	    Trees down across trail,	    Overgrown in places.	Road suitable for all vehicles	The road to Walt Bailey trailhead is in good shape aside from the occasional pothole, but does have a giant tree over the road that you have to drive under. My Outback made it with plenty of clearance, but a taller SUV or a high truck will not clear it. Cars, small to mid size SUVs, or lower trucks only.  There are a ton of ripe berries everywhere along the trail right now, especially up on Bald Ridge. On the down side, there are so many spider webs every step of the way! This was one of the worst trails in regard to spiders I have ever hiked. I suggest trekking poles to wave in front of you as you hike to clear the way. A lot of nice meadows, ponds, and lakes. The Cutthroat Lakes basin is very pretty with many lakes. Trail is easy to follow to get to the start of the Cutthroat Lakes basin. Through the basin, just be sure to follow the main largest trails. Aim for the right/west shore of the upper of the two largest lakes and follow the right side of that lake as the trail leads up past it and climbs up toward the ridge. As you near the top of the ridge go right at a trail junction. The trail reaches the ridge and goes west along the south side of Bald Mountain. It gets brushy in places. Some switchbacks and up to a high point on the shoulder of the mountain just under the summit on its south side. Here a boot path heads up to the top. There are a couple places of some easy scrambling up grippy good rock. The summit has a register and a geocache, but the very tippy top rock is infested with flying ants! 10 miles 2800' gain 7 hours round trip.

Pinnacle Lake	RTMoore	Obstacles on trail:	    Trees down across trail,	    Muddy or wet trail.	Road rough but passable	Nothing much new to report on the hike itself; just posting a current picture of the bathtub pothole, largely drained.  It is between 12" and 18" down to the top of the water.  Fortunately the slope is sufficiently gentle to allow safe passenger car passage.  It will be a shame if the Forest Service allows the front pothole to grow into the bathtub; it might kill access to 3 good trailheads for those of us in passenger cars. I was the first one at the trailhead today.  That, the heat, and the lack of bugs allowed me the choice of trail clothes.  Swimming and sunning at the lake during the day was quiet and good.  The only company was 2 parties passing through to Bathtub Lakes.  Fishing was as poor as would be expected for this heat.

Lime Kiln Trail	Frog326	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	An easy to moderate hike, relatively level trail, quite wide at points. Took about 3 hours round trip. Nice river access at end. Also view of old Railroad Bridge Foundation near trails end. Robe Canyon Trail Sign and trail needs attention. Machete required for trail access.	Aug 15, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-15.6902512455
Snow Lake	AsiaS	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	It is a rocky and a hot hike. With the current air situation hiking is not the greatest idea. I heard people complaining about breathing on their way up to the lake. The trail gets busy even on a Tuesday morning. Be ready to share the trail with bigger groups of people. To the guy in flipflops, I hope you made it safe. 	Aug 15, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-15.7737399703
Bear Ridge	Maddy	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	The Bear Ridge Trail lived up to its name.  We saw a fairly large cub climbing a tree then mama bear came sauntering up the trail. Fortunately we were a couple hundred feet from mom and never were in between the two. I also wanted to share some photos of our 11 day trip to Iceland from last week.  We did the loop road around the perimeter of the island. What an amazing place for beautiful scenery and unbelievable waterfalls.  It's just a 7.5 hour non-stop flight away.  Prices are very high. Expect to pay at least $25 for a cheeseburger. Gas is $9/gal. The weather was often cold and windy.  The terrain around the perimeter is fairly flat and there are no trees so you get to enjoy wide open vistas everywhere you drive and hike.

Sloan Peak	Stucker	Obstacles on trail:	    .	Road recommended for high clearance only	Bugs were an annoyance	We did Sloan Peak via Bedal Creek on a somewhat smoky day. 13 hrs. car to car/11.5 miles/5100’ gain. Strong navigation skills required for approach and getting across the glacier. The crevasses are visible (and large) and snow bridge seemed “ok” but you must have glacier travel/rescue skills of course. Scramble seemed sandbagged a little. Expect class four moves. A great alpine trail lies above the glacier that winds around the mountain (corkscrew route) and the meadows below are beautiful and full of berries and flowers. Gear and expertise required. 	Aug 15, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-16.1882531922
Cougar Trails	BeaverDawg	Minor obstacles posing few problems	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	We went back to the Cougar Trails last night, still hazy weather but cooler and couldn't smell the smoke this time.  We did a different section of trails which took us passed the field, but from a different direction, where we saw the coyote the night before, and saw another coyote in roughly the same spot, (at the edge of the field near the tree line).  It could have been the same one from the night before but it looked larger to me? Trails we covered were in good shape.  	Aug 15, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-16.9845273716
Summerland - Panhandle Gap	raftisland	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	Three 60 + ladies hiked to Summerland Meadow , about 8.2 miles round trip. ( we did NOT go to Panhandle gap.) Good hike for a warm day, as about 3/4  of hike is in the trees and passing a waterfall. Summerland was spectacular, with some wildflowers still blooming, the "river" running, and great views. A fabulous spot. On August 15 2018 it was very smoky in Tacoma/Seattle due to wildfires. The air was much clearer on this hike, although there was still a bit of haze.  We had to park on road ( no spots left at (9:30 AM on a Wednsday, but the trail was not all that busy. 	Aug 15, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-16.2443997758
Franklin Falls	MK4R34	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Great hike for family, dog, or beginner snowshoe. Tiny parking lot on the way down can cut half the distance if there's open spots. Smokey Wednesday evening and only encountered a small handful of people. 	Aug 15, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-16.4038062091
Yellow Aster Butte	hikingwithmylover	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	Despite the smoke hanging around Baker and Shuksan, air to the north were much clearer so the summit at Yellow Aster Butte was a beautiful destination for the day. Road was passable but a bit rough for lower clearance vehicles, I'd imagine any car could make it taken slow enough. Trail felt quite steep up until the split off to Tomyhoi, after that it was nice rolling hills until the summit. Lots of huckleberries are ripening after the split off as well, we couldn't help ourselves from stopping at least a few times for some especially delicious looking berries. Also some nice wildflowers along the way. Summit had a nice breeze but lots and lots of bugs- flies, ants, etc. On the way down, we filtered water at the snowmelt runoff, that seemed to be the last reliable source on the trail although we did hear some trickling water in a few spots. Saw a small black dog (maybe a chihuahua?) on the drive down, 1.9 miles before reaching 542 from the trailhead. No collar, acted a bit frightened and ran down a side road when we pulled over. Checked Chair 9 for any missing dog posters but no reports. 	Aug 15, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-15.5301731502
Stetattle Creek	C P	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Stetattle Creek is always cool, even on the hottest days.  I feel like a proud parent when I hike the part past the "Not Maintained Beyond Here" sign, still looks great 2 months later. The last 2 streams have dried up, the one with 3 waterfalls is flowing nicely (first one past the sign).  Still well worth the walk out to trails end to see the huge trees, possibly extend the trail even further.  I found at least a few more cut logs today, did no clearing.  I did kick sticks on "my" part, almost perfect!

Wonderland Trail - Mowich Lake to Sunrise via Spray Park	Hikes With Kids	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Hiked the Wonderland North section from Mowich Lake to Sunrise (via the Spray  Park alternate route) last weekend with my daughter, 3 of her friends, and 2 of mine.  Two nights in the backcountry - first at Carbon River Camp, second at Granite Creek Camp.  Started on Friday 8/10 around noon from Mowich Lake (after dealing with the most horrific flat tire ever) at 4925 ft, with blue skies but smoky haze largely obscuring the Mountain.  Lots of crowds even on a non-weekend day up to Spray Park, where a few bees and flies pestered us but nothing a little picardin could not solve.  From there up and over the high point at 6400' and down to lovely, LOVELY Seattle Park, probably my favorite place along this trail.  Long descent of 3200 feet-pounding feet to Carbon River camp.  Very nice backcountry camp in the lower old growth forest amid tall trees.  Dinner under clear skies, accompanied by a nice Merlot brought by the most excellent Pastor Peter, and then to bed with the roar of Carbon River providing bedtime music. Up Saturday early under a thick marine layer, very misty.  Backcountry French press coffee (oh thank you, THANK you, SnowPeak company!) and various oatmeals, packed up in the mist, and shortly after facing the infamous Carbon River Suspension bridge.  Bouncy but not daunting - after the standard cliche jokes ("What's yer name? What's yer quest? What's - your favorite color?" and, of course, "YOU - SHALL NOT - PAAAASSSSS!") we stood safe on the other side and began the grueling 4 mile, 2800 ft ascent to Moraine Park at 6000' under persistent thick marine clouds that blocked the Mountain (sigh) and the hot sun (yay).  Blueberries and huckleberries are coming out all along this stretch, interspersed with magenta paintbrush and blue incheon.  Two separate field repairs required on my right boot - thanks to my friend Winfried for bringing the duct tape!  Not a bug to be found this cold and foggy day, and they were not missed.  Lunch at Mystic Lake, with a bit of rain, then blue-sky sucker holes opened up and beckoned us down to the crossing of Winthrop Creek at 4600' - FAR more harrowing on that aging old log bridge with creaky rail than the veritable engineering wonder of the Carbon River mini-Tacoma-Narrows construct.  Then up the last, fateful, will-testing 1200 feet to Granite Creek Camp at 5800 ft.  No berries to speak of, but no bugs either. Camp set up under sun, with rain moving in just as soon as we got the tarp rigged and stoves lit.  Post dinner treat this night was our backcountry bourbon bar courtesy of Heritage Distilling Company and their wonderful little mini-bottles, while the under-21's played cards in one of the tents.  Rain, rain, rain until bed - but during my 3am "call of the wild" I stepped out under brilliant starry skies and knew it was going to be all good. Sunshine and true blue skies on Sunday morning.  Last of the coffee, oatmeal, and anything else edible as lunch was only a few hours off back in Civilization, USA.  Steep climb of 900' to Skyscraper Pass at 6700' to start but it was no problem because I KNEW I HAD DONE IT, and it was easy-peezy from there to the Sunrise Snack Bar.  We finally could see the Mountain in all its glory, which we took full measure of from a side trip up Skyscraper Peak, 7100'.  Then back to the crowds as we approached Sunrise, the crowds and then the mega-crowds and then the teeming hordes, oh my word, so many people.  I think we saw about 25 people between Seattle Park and Skyscraper Pass - and saw about 2500 people on the other two sections of the trail.  Made it to the old trusty minivan at Sunrise and headed down for ice cream at Greenwater Outfitters and pizza in Enumclaw at Frankies.  Upon leaving the Sunrise parking area, the cars were parked down the road at least a mile from the visitor center, the ranger was there metering the prospective entrants, and the line of cars from the White River ranger station entrance extended to within about 1/2 mile of highway 410.  Holy, holy moley. Commentary:  1) Man, does the NPS do it right with backcountry campsites.  Pit toilets, yes, but with honest-to-goodness toilet seats.  Bear poles.  Big, nice, flat camps in lovely settings and easy water access. 2) as hinted before, the eponymous Wonderland Trail lives up to billing even in not-ideal weather - the marine clouds blocked the Mountain but focused our eyes on the flowers and rills and meadows instead. 3) Mystic Lake does not look at all like I pictured - largely because of mis-reading the description in my old Manning/Spring MRNP hiking guide - but nice all the same 4) my moniker of Hikes with Kids is still appropriate even though the kids are now in their late teens and in college - still kids to me and still wonderful to share a trail with 5) special thanks to Ian for carrying my camp chair!

Buck Creek	Naturegym	Minor obstacles posing few problems	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	I found this trail by accident when going left at Ranger Airport Station trail enterance instead of veering right. I had my ten year old with me so we didn't get too far (about 5 miles in) before having to turn around and head back. The section we were on was pretty dense forest but very well maintained path. We were high above the river and enjoyed the streams and overlooks along the way. It was so smoky and hazy from forest fires that we did not get to enjoy some of the beautiful mountain views that others posted about. I look forward to going back when my son is older and we have more packed to complete the larger full trail. This trail is definitely made for more experienced hikers.

Naches Peak Loop	Erik25959	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	We wanted to hike somewhere outside of the smoke and though it wasn't smoke-free, it was significantly better than in Eastern Washington. To the south it was socked in but to the north we did see some blue sky. Wildflowers were worth it.  Didn't see much of Mt. Rainier but definitely better than being in the smoke and it was 20 degrees cooler.  Great hike!	Aug 15, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-15.6314542743
Fort Ebey State Park	Gotogranny	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Very hazy again today from the fires all around, so decided to stay close to home. Fort Ebey is always fun because of the many interconnecting trails--it's a new hike every time! I started at the end of the Pt. Partridge Road and hiked the bluff trail to Lake Pondilla. Then I took off along a short section of the P.N.T. and over to Kyle's Kettle. I'm beginning to really like that trail, good tread, peak-a-boo views of the lake, some good uphill sections. The Grandpa Tree side loop isn't as much fun. Because I didn't think to take the map, kind of rambled a bit getting back to the car. I was out there to get some Hike-a-thon miles, so it was all good.

McCollum Park	ToddlerTrekking	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	We managed to get in just a short hike with all the smoke. The Forest Loop at McCollum was, as always, a nice shady outing with the kiddo. Things are really dry right now of course so no ponds or mud to play in and the fall fungus isn't coming up yet. This summer, my four-year-old son and I are hiking to raise money for Washington Trails Association. Please consider donating to one of our Hike-A-Thons at the below links.

Independence and North Lakes	Lucy	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	I had planned on going on this hike today and it was great to see someone had posted an update on this trail yesterday. Thank you to the person who wrote the report and gave directions for the cutoff to North Lake. I've been on this trail before but I've not travelled to North Lake. This trail has a lot of ups and downs leading to a good amount of elevation gain. It is steep and rocky much of the way. You reach Independence lake fairly quickly but North Lake is more of a challenge. If you want to go to North lake, I suggest reading the report from yesterday to get your bearings straight. I was surprised to see some wildflowers still blooming near water sources. Views were definitely limited by the smoke. I tried a little fishing in North Lake but that proved unsuccessful. A couple of folks were around enjoying the lakes and tarns along the way. Fewer people than I expected.  With limited views by the smoke invading the region, I turned my attention to small creatures going about their existence in the world, hence the photos of frogs and butterflies.

Nike Horse Trail	EmilB	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	- Plenty of Sky Country parking at 5 PM on a Wednesday - Coal Creek Falls is dry (see picture below) - The trails are just beautiful - especially in the amber, rising/setting, wild-fire sun - but bugs abound - The trails have a real late-summer feel, even though it is still arguably mid-summer, because during the dry spell many trees lost leaves - Bring a bear bell or otherwise be sure to make noise.  I saw four piles of bear droppings and heard some suspicious crashing off in the bushes.  No doubt they are black bears - and so relatively harmless - but you want them to know you are coming. Per Garmin,    Every stretch of the figure-8-shaped lot is a one-way (see the attached picture).  Directionality is indicated with traffic signs and pavement arrows.  However, people frequently drive against the one-ways.  We’ve all disregarded parking lot traffic signs, but the lot has blind corners that are only safe when directionality is followed.  I have seen people charging excitedly into the parking lot and around blind corners with the confidence they have the right-of-way to the whole lane.  I have also seen people in a hurry to get home drive furiously around the same blind corners the wrong way.  At some point, people will collide.  So, do not be one of those people; recognize that, once you are in the parking lot, Mad Max rules apply and drive cautiously around every corner assuming someone could be hurtling against the one-way toward you.

Heybrook Lookout	lanceH	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Got to trail parking about 9:30 am after deciding to do the hike even though air quality was poor due to BC fires. I was the only vehicle in the parking lot. Went at a brisk pace to top and it was all uphill! There were some less steep parts (I wouldn't exactly say it leveled out) and made it to the lookout tower in 28 minutes. According to my watch (gps garmin triathlon watch) it was only 1 mile to the lookout tower (not 1.3) but that is possibly not 100% accurate. I was just expecting to go about 1/3 mile further according to my watch but the lookout tower was right in front of me! I was the only one up there and enjoyed the limited view due to hazy air for about 20 min. Went to the top of the lookout tower but heights exactly aren't my thing so I didn't spend too much time up there. I pretty much jogged the whole way down and encountered one pair of hikers and also a large group (some kids day camp) on the trail. Made it down in 14 minutes. A quick hike but give you a good workout and on clear days would give excellent views so I may be back soon when the air clears out.

Barclay Lake	Dan Whitmarsh	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	An enjoyable hike for all skill levels. We enjoyed lots of ripe blueberries and huckleberries along the way. Not too crowded, being midweek, but we did pass a few larger groups heading in to camp. The water level is low and the surrounding hills are shrouded in smoke from the B. C. fires. A perfect day hike, and a great introduction to hiking for one of our group.

Tonga Ridge / Mount Sawyer	Snofzig	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	This makes for a great day hike, and I hope to return someday for an overnight. The road leading up to the trailhead is one of the best forest service roads I've been on. You have about 9 ish miles of gravel road to get to the trail, but most of that is very smooth and not super worn. There are patches of potholes and rocks, but for the most part I was able to average 30mph on the straight sections, which for gravel is really fast, and it was pretty smooth. The trailhead is not super big, but on a day like today it was pretty empty with only 2 other cars there. There is a vault toilet a little bit away from the trail, and is signed. You do need to self-issues a (free) wilderness pass for the Alpine Lakes wilderness, which the hike enters. The hike is very nice and involves a bit of elevation gain, but not too much. I only went the first 2 miles to Mt. Sawyer, but the trail was in good condition. If you are looking for views, I would highly reccomend a trip up Mt. Sawyer. I would estimate that its about a mile round trip up and down the mountain. The turn off to climb Mt. Sawyer is marked with a wooden sign now, and there is a large cairn, so it is very hard to miss. The trail is also pretty well maintained, and although it gets a little tight at times, it has some great views. The top of Mt. Sawyer is a great spot to sit down and have some food. There where some bugs, but they weren't nearly as bad as other hikes in similar areas. The views where stellar despite the wildfire haze. Overall this makes a great day hike, and would probably make an enjoyable overnight trip as well.	Aug 15, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-15.5483734635

Still enough water to look good. Very smoky. So few views except the falls.	Aug 15, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-15.8653804339
Tonga Ridge / Mount Sawyer	ninjaracerchick	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	Time for my annual trip here for blueberries! Smoke is very bad, though it is everywhere. Road is in pretty good shape, once you hit the first spur road it gets even better. The road to Tonga isn’t short, but it’s usally one of the best forest roads I travel all season so it’s pleasurable ! Trail is in great shape, wildflowers are still blooming, and blueberries are and the beginning end of ripe. Bugs were super frustrating! Small amount of mosquitoes, worst was the biting flies!

Mount Constitution and Mountain Lake	hikingwithlittledogs	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	I’ve always said I could hike downhill all day and that’s pretty much what we did.  We started at the summit of Mount Constitution taking in the hazy view from the tower. Picked up a map from the concession stand along with a raspberry lemonade sorbet (you won’t regret it!) then headed off down the very steep trail to Twin Lakes. The trail is dry with some loose dirt. You might bring a hiking pole for your knees. This section of the trail is very quiet. The tall skinny trees look even taller and skinnier because of the steep slope.  We took a detour at Twin Lakes. Not great for swimming but the yellowing lily pads were very pretty. We continued downhill towards Mountain Lake where we took a left to stay on the far side of the lake. This is a Great Lake for swimming. We found a rock in the sun and took a nice break. Watched some canoes paddling and swimmers flying off a rope swing into the lake.  On we went, past some big trees, startling a little deer. At the dam, we stayed left and headed towards Cascade Falls. It was nice to hear the creek along the trail here.  We checked out a trio of pretty little waterfalls. Be careful to stay on the trail. The dogs enjoyed cooling off in the shallow water.  When we reached the south end camp at Cascade Lake we stayed left. Passed some kids jumping off the bridge. Found the rope swing gone so swimmers had to jump from the tree instead.  Finally made it to the swimming beach where we found our chauffeur.  Teenagers spent the day at the beach so it was a perfect summer day all around.  Happy hike-a-thon!

Robinson Creek - Robinson Mountain	Cagey	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	We arrived at Robinson Creek Trailhead at 11:44 am to find one vehicle and one horse trailer in the parking lot.  We geared up and hit the trail with Beauty Creek Falls as our destination.  We crossed the first bridge at 12:40 pm and made it to the second bridge at 13:35.  Views of Beauty Creek Falls from the second bridge were lovely, so we decided to continue on the climbers trail to try and get closer.  There are some  rocky promontories that afford close up views.  We had lunch and cooled down before heading back the way we came.  We made it back to the trail head at 17:30, totally covered in dust and mud from a long day on the trail.  All told, we did 7.78 miles and approximately 1800 vertical feet.  Some areas of the trail are overgrown but the trail is still clearly defined.  Some salmon berries and huckleberries remained.  There were some deer prints on the trail, and evidence of horses, but we didn’t see any wildlife and only ran into one other couple the entire trip. The smoke wasn’t bad, but definitely limited the views down the canyon.  All in all a fantastic day. The pup report: there is one major creek crossing for water (the first bridge), along with an easier access point slightly upstream.  There are two other small trickles that afforded some opportunity to drink.  There is a flat area near Beauty Creek falls Bridge that also allowed for water access.  A few scree fields were tough on the paws, but overall a dry and dusty trail.  There was some shade, which was a great break from full sun.

Comet Falls	lizquist	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	Arrived around 10:30. The lot was full, but there was space on the road. The trail is in great condition and is easy to follow. The switch backs get a little steep but nothing crazy. Beautiful views at both waterfalls. The smoke wasn’t awful but we certainly noticed a difference and the sky was pretty hazy.	Aug 15, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-15.1471581249
Mohawk Falls and Mohawk Mine	karnage	Obstacles on trail:	    Trees down across trail.	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Thanks to the trip report by CP below, I decided to take my to kids out to see this waterfall. To get here, you need to turn on Old Cascade Highway, headed south from Highway 2. Then you follow the road until you get to the forest road where you turn right and it turns into gravel. From there, as someone else mentioned, it is 3.2 miles to the 'trailhead'. That's exactly where I found it. I had to get out of the car to see where the trail started and make sure I was in the right spot. It's where the culvert goes under the road, too the right side there's a huge old growth stump where the trail begins. From there the trail was relatively easy to follow. My four year old managed the trail without much difficulty, and actually had a lot of fun climbing over some of the obstacles. There are a few small trees down but nothing that's too tricky. Huckleberries are all around the trail, as well as blueberry bushes that are as high as my head. A few huge old trees were interesting to see as well. The falls were peaceful and beautiful. We ate our lunch there and then headed back. Since it's August, probably the flow is a bit lower than it would be normally, so a lot of the big smooth rock was exposed where we sat. It was fine for my four year old, but I didn't let my two-year-old off my back because I didn't feel it was safe enough. We didn't see the mine, but I wasn't sure where to look and I'm not sure that it would be safe for kids. The falls were enough for us! I would agree with the 1. 2 mile round-trip assessment. #hikeathon	Aug 15, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-15.7330307990

Thunder Knob	JoeHendricks	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	This was a smoke day classified as ‘moderate’ by EPA’s smoke website to give you an idea of conditions here when you see that rating.  I’ll add more photos and the hike video when I get nack to wifi. Smoke:  from the viewpoints we could only see the outline of Pyramid and Colonial peaks.  Same with Sourdough scross the lake.  No breathing trouble though and I have asthma. bugs: yellow jackets at the viewpoints were a pest wildflowers: only some pearly everlasting, hardhack and fireweed.   Wildlife: saw three teenage spruce grouse chicks and thier mom!

Greenwater and Echo Lakes	JRhikes	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Only 2 other cars in the parking lot at 7:30 on a Tuesday morning, and those belonged to a group of campers. Trail is in excellent condition all the way to Echo Lake. There's a lot of up and down until about the split for Lost Lake. The ups are relatively short and not too difficult. After the split the trail heads up, up, up with a long climb to the top of the ridge overlooking Echo Lake. The only mosquitos I encountered were from Maggie Creek to the top of the ridge. There were no bugs at the lake. After the Maggie Creak turn off there are several places along the edge of the trail that look like they could easily give way or slide, so watch your step and stay to the inside. Evidence of last year's Norse Peak fire are evident all along the way but the most significant damage is at the top of the ridge and along Echo Lake to horse camp. The trail along the lake is damaged, covered in soft sandy ash in some areas, and also crumbling along the edges. There's even a spot where new grass has completely overgrown the trail for a couple of feet. There is one bridge that burned but it's sturdy, and another that lost the first plank so it's a bit of a step to get onto it. At horse camp you can look around and see the extent of the fire damage across the various ridges to the south and west.

Pinnacle Lake	BigButtDon	Obstacles on trail:	    .	Road rough but passable	Bugs were not too bad	On the promise of a hot, smokey day, Geezer Patrol minus 2 opted for an "easier" jaunt than usual - a mere 5 miles RT and 1200' of elevation.  Unfortunately, we forgot the effects of age and how well our feet enjoy a walk on 90% tree roots interspersed with rocks. The road in from the Mountain Loop Hiway is 6 miles of bomb craters and exposed rock shelves.  Take your time and most cars with any clearance at all can make it up there.  No pooper for you at the TH either but also no bugs. The trail to Bear Lake and 200 yards beyond is just fine.  Then, its root city most of the way to the top.  It took us 2.5 hours to travel the 2.5 miles as one of us couldn't seem to get a head of steam up in the stifling, smokey, zero breeze environment.  Arrival at the lake was most welcome for the swim and the isolation of being the only ones on the trail to enjoy the destination.  The top .5 inches of the lake was quite warm.  Anything below that was quite nipply.  Encountered only two parties on our way down.  The condition of the road in and the tough trail seem to limit the usage in a major way.  Irritated eyes and throats from the smoke weren't helpful either but hopefully weather shifts will cure that problem soon.

Wallace Falls State Park	Sarahn218	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Such a fun hike with great views! Not to many people on the trail midweek, and the path was very easy to navigate.	Aug 14, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-15.3290027899
Annette Lake	Dorotheos	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Decided to take our "visiting home after boot camp" Marine little brother on a trip with the family (as if he didn't get enough hiking and running during boot camp). Arrived at the parking lot around 8:50, parking lot had about 3 cars. With wildfires around the area we were prepared for some smoke in the air, which was visible on our drive over. The hike starts off and pretty much holds to a constant gain in elevation which was some-what a challenge for our 50 year old parents. We had to stop to let them catch up a few times. Overall the trail conditions are fine but have a lot of roots above ground which make it somewhat difficult to hike up.   Temperatures reached around the 80s but with the tree coverage it was nice and cool pretty much the whole hike. The Lake was beautiful and quite (a bit hazy). We swam for a bit in the clear cool waters.  Had a few stick in the bottom of the foot which was unpleasant.   There was a lot of small trout jumping all over the lake. It took us about 2hrs to get to the lake even with having to make multiple stops to wait for our parents to catch up. We had lunch at the lake at one of the campsites which are also very nice and would make a great place to spend the night.   It took us another good 2hrs to get back down, which included many photo taking with my brother who is going back to training shortly. Tried to soak in the moments. Once we reached the bottom we hiked the .5 mile Asahel Curtis Nature Trail which has a few satisfactory spectacles. We saw a good amount of hikers with their dogs who seemed to be also enjoying the hike. Overall it was a nice hike. Thinking as a parent I probably wouldn't take my children who are 4 years and under on this hike due to the elevation gain and would probably end up carrying them most of the way. The Nature trail would be a perfect hike for kids if you are passing by on I-90. Beats stopping at a rest area. (There is one restroom at the parking lot)	Aug 14, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-14.4143570311
Mohawk Falls and Mohawk Mine	C P	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Came over to Skykomish from Lake Wenatchee area to escape the smoke.  Had lunch at the Cascadia Inn, pretty good and reasonable price. I must have liked it, I'm back for dinner- different menu.   Had a few minutes between meals to do a little hike.  I cleared this trail a couple of months ago after CallieB wrote on June 5th it was brushy- still looks great. I had never heard of it before that. Whole thing up and down took less than an hour, really a nice spot if you're in the area.  Great sunbathing rocks below the falls, reminds me of Denny Creek. Less smoky here but still pretty bad.  More Skykomish stuff-  Trains roll through every 15 minutes or so, just waved to the Amtrak.  Great Northern Museum open Thursday through Monday, with a model train that you can ride, donations accepted. The way the town sits it gets sun all day, kinda like a mini Canmore, Alberta.  Library has free wifi accessible from outside for when it's closed.  There's a coin Laundromat!  Cascadia Inn has hot showers for $7, cheapest rooms $69. Looks like I'll be sleeping in the car again!	Aug 14, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-14.5095923232
John Tursi Trail	cgrimnes	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	This was a great trail - I have been wanting to try it for awhile now since I live about 1 mile from the trailhead. My golden retriever, my 6 month old and myself hiked this afternoon from 2-330. Started at the parking lot on Donnell and Sharpe Rd and hiked about 1 mile in to the lookout where you can see Rodgers Bluff. This hike says it is only 2.2 miles roundtrip, but that would imply that I was at the end, but there was definitely more trail to hike. I assume it is longer than 2.2 miles. Great hike - good little workout with a 15 pound baby on you! I didn't see anyone or any animals...it was very peaceful! I will definitely be exploring further soon!

Mount Pilchuck	EBSTEVE	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	This morning about 1/2 mile in I saw a bear about 300' away, maybe 75' from the trail.

Cascade Pass	gemhikes	Minor obstacles posing few problems	Road rough but passable	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	I slept in the Marblemount ranger station parking lot the night before in order to be first in line the next morning (and would have been second had I arrived an hour later...), yet still Sahale eluded me... at first. I was given a permit for the next night and then when I stopped back in the ranger station a few hours later I was greeted with a music-to-my-ears "someone just gave up their reservation tonight for Sahale!". I switched dates and went on down the road. The first part of the gravel section of Cascade River Road is the most washboard-y of the drive, after that it's fairly smooth sailing with some decidedly large potholes scattered around, especially on some of the hairpin turns and up where the road washed out earlier this year. It didn't seem to phase anyone from the looks of the various types of cars that were parked at the trailhead, though. I arrived around noon on a Tuesday and the lot was about 2/3 full. I started off at 12:15pm and began the surprisingly easy approach to Cascade Pass - it was my first time up here and I didn't realize how numerous and in some places almost-level switchbacks were getting up to the Pass. It makes for a somewhat monotonous first couple of miles but they go quickly. The smoke was bad but a little bit better than the previous day had been. I made it up to the pass in about an hour and 45 minutes and just kept trekking. The trail is in decent shape most of the way, really, until you get to the last section that climbs up to the glacier camp. A group going down the first set of switchbacks leaving the pass told me they'd seen a bear in that section earlier in the day, but it must have moved on for the afternoon. Saw a few pika here and there and the marmots started on Sahale Arm for me. When you get to the last ascent it is easy enough to follow with cairns, that said I realized that I went up a slightly sketchier way due to trail wear - there's a point where it looks as though the trail continues straight up on the side of the slope but it actually cuts sharply to the left. I didn't notice it on the way up because it cuts over at a pretty flat grade and didn't stand out much to me. There was a cairn but it was mostly toppled over. Anyway, you can get up either way but you'll be better off looking for the route to the left, they meet up again a little farther up to go through the rock fields. A goat was waiting to greet me as soon as I stepped up into camp, which was a fun welcome, but I didn't see it again the rest of the time. All in all in took me about 4hrs 15min to get up to camp, so not my fastest 6mi. That said, it was day four in a row of 4000ft of elevation gain for me, so I'll give myself a bit of a break! The haze made for pretty subdued views from what you'd otherwise get up here, but still gorgeous. Lots of running water up there so no need to pack up extra. The night got cooler than expected, but makes sense with wind blowing off the glacier. Beautiful stars and Milky Way looking straight up away from the smoke. I woke up for sunrise and the smoke had cleared up a little bit so there was a second layer of mountains visible. Slow morning in camp and enjoyed the view from what has to be one of the nicest composting toilets I've encountered in the backcountry. I left camp around 10:45am and was back at the car a little before 2pm, though my pace definitely slowed in that last mile as I got into the berry bushes - a few lingering salmonberries, some new thimbleberries, huckleberries, and blueberries all out in that lower section right now! So glad to have finally made it up here :) 	Aug 14, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-16.9851481519
Chinook Pass to Crystal Mountain via the Pacific Crest Trail	jeffgraham	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	A friend and I started out at the Chinook Pass trailhead to Sheep Lake about 8:30 am. after we had dropped off a car at Crystal Mountain. We hiked just above Hwy 410 for a mile before starting up some switchbacks to Sheep Lake. Keep right on the trail before you reach the lake. The trail seems to be going the wrong direction, but it eventually climbs to a nice lookout over Sheep Lake and heads back to the left and eventually reaches the crest of the hill. There is a junction here with a sign for the Pacific Crest Trail about 3 miles into the hike. Turn right to stay on the PCT going downhill. If you go straight about 100 yards you will come to a sign stating you are entering Mt. Rainier National Park. Continue on a short way and you get a good view of Crystal Lake and Mount Rainier. It was smokey when we hiked so the view wasn't as good as normal. You can continue on this poor trail down to Crystal Lake but the hike back up is quite a climb. Staying on the PCT you will most likely meet other hikers. Since it was a weekday, we saw less than a dozen other hikers. The views from walking on the flank of the hill are wonderful - more so if not smokey.  After 6 1/2 miles you reach a sign gives the choice to stay on the PCT or take one of two other trails. "Hen Skin Lake 1193" is one way and "Silver Creek Trail 1192" is the other. You choose one to get to Crystal Mountain where your second car is waiting. We chose Hen Skin Lake. The trail is not well traveled but easily followed. When we reached the lake, there were hundreds of pollywogs along the shore. They were still very young with no legs growing yet. This is a good spot for a picnic, but this was the only place where the flies started to bother us. They didn't land very long but it was disruptive when trying to eat and swat. I can't give a good trail to get to Crystal Mountain because my hiking buddy knew some short cuts on small trails. The ski hill was down and a little to the left. We then hiked down the ski run to the lodge parking lot. With the hike down to Crystal Lake, we were on the trail about 6 1/2 hours. This included some swimming at Hen Skin Lake which was a very refreshing stop. The distance was 9.2 miles.	Aug 14, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-15.9433478199
Summerland - Panhandle Gap	lov2travel	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Intermittent snow - not hard to cross	Trail to Summerland in good condition.  On the trail to the gap, mostly through rock fields, couple places it was hard to spot where the trail was.  Only one small snowfield to cross and another spot on a very steep rocky area just before the gap, that climbed around the snow/icy spot, that was scary and relieved when I was through that area.  Will probably be melted out in few days.  It was smoky so views were somewhat obscured.  The gap area was beautiful.  Most of the flowers are done except in some of the creek basins.  It was a hot day but several streams that have water flowing so plenty places to replenish your water.  	Aug 14, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-15.2423504239
Silver Falls Loop	JJ Hikers	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	I haven’t been able to hike for 2 1/2 months due to crazy medical issues, so this trail was a great one for my return hike! My friend and I arrived to the trailhead around 8:30AM and had the trail to ourselves. This is an easy loop with a beautiful waterfall. Even though it was a very smoky and hazy day, we didn’t even notice it on this trail.	Aug 14, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-15.8036623531
Pratt Mountain	magickneito	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Took the afternoon to go explore Pratt Mountain from the Talapus Lake trailhead - very well maintained and quite popular up to Talapus even on a smoky Tuesday.  I made the mistake of following the sign to Olallie Lake instead of Pratt Lake (looks like a footbridge washed out) but it was a pleasant detour.  After the half mile and back to the end of Olallie, I continued on towards Pratt Lake and shortly took a left on the Pratt Lake Trail.  At the junction, I took a left on the Island Lake Trail and continued on it until I started losing elevation.  At this point there are a couple way trails that take you quickly up to the southern boulder fields of Pratt Mountain.  It was a fun and straightforward scramble several hundred feet up to the false summit and the cairn.  The path continues through a couple trees to the true summit and the registry.  Total time 4.5 hours but safer to plan more time than this next time!

Annette Lake	Ava McGee	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Had a lovely mid-week day hike to Annette lake today. We got a late start and arrived to the trail head at 11ish. I saw a toilet there but didn’t investigate it.  The trail is in good shape. There was some pretty fresh bear scat, unsurprisingly with all the berries! It took a full two hours to get up to the lake as we kept getting distracted with blueberries and salmon berries and even a few thimbleberries still. Most of the elevation was in forest so shaded and cooler which was nice as the day was hot.  The lake was hazy but beautiful - I imagine sunset and sunrise will be extra bright with the red sun. Lots of flies, a few biting mosquitos but not too bad. We lazed around and swam. A good amount of people even for a Tuesday; met a couple going up for overnight but most others seemed like Day hikers as well.  Will definitely Do this again as an overnight - hopefully on a clearer day. 	Aug 14, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-14.3573856784
Lake 22	Muledeer	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Yeah it was Lake 22. We got up early and there were only 3 cars in the parking lot. That's the way to do this classic hike, early AM midweek. It was nice to see the new trailwork that crews worked on last year. I worked on the first day, moving gravel for the path while others worked on the cribbing supports. Now the mudhole at the beginning is gone, there is a nice gravel path and at some point some real nice stairs were also added. My short legs thank you for not making them so darn high!  After that the trail is well trod, there is minimal water over the rocks and the scree field is still a PITA coming back down. The smoke was bad, really bad. No views of Three Fingers from the scree field and in fact, you could barely see the Pilchuck spires. The lake was still nice and there were some flowers still blooming, fireweed, cow parsnip and ladies tresses, that pretty little white orchid. Berries ripe too, but sour. Elderberry, mtn ash and devils club berries added some nice red color.   RANT:  Your orange peels DO NOT decompose for years, your wet wipes DO NOT decompose and that is totally GROSS alongside the trail, and your dog poo bags DO NOT pick themselves up. And really, why leave a wet t shirt on the trail?  We hiked out, get this, a plastic gallon water container!  Does your mother hike here? If not PICK UP AFTER YOURSELVES!! When I saw people coming up with plastic water containers, I said as politely as I could, you ARE planning on packing that out right? On the plus side almost all the dogs were leashed, small progress can be made!   For all you hikeathoners, it is listed as 5.4 miles to the lake, and GT has the lake loop as 1.2   Hikeathon: give.wta.org/Muledeer 	Aug 14, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-14.8423324555
Franklin Falls	hannah.perry	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Franklin Falls was a wonderful hike for my family from out of town. The trail was in excellent condition and it was an easy 1-mile hike to the falls. There were lots of spots to stop and see the river along the way, and bugs were never an issue. We started the hike at 8:00 and did not see any other people until we were on our way back from the falls at around 9:30. Would definitely do this hike again!

High Divide - Seven Lakes Basin Loop	charlieystella	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	There’s no way to sugar coat it - the smokey haze is a big bummer this week. We kept hearing it was supposed to clear but never did. Getting permits this time of year is tough even on a weekday and even with the smoke. We left Seattle at 5:15 am Sunday and got to the WIC right at 8 am and were #5 in line. The area was already full for that night and we got one of the last few permits for Monday and Tuesday at Canyon Creek #3 and then Hoh lake. A couple in front of us got the last permit for Lunch Lake. Even though it’s a bit farther and harder to hike to, I think Hoh lake is nicer - we had an amazing site and the lake is bigger and beautiful. Without smoke we would have had a clear view of Mt. Olympus from our site. The bugs were bad and we’re covered in bites but it was all still worth it. We saw 5 black bears in total - 3 at Hoh lake. They stayed on the opposite side and never bothered us, and were fun to watch. Saw a mama and baby mountain goat on the trail and a few marmots.  I think it’s easy to underestimate how much elevation gain you have to conquer in a short distance. We were glad to break up the climb into two days - the first 1800 feet or so up to Canyon creek 3 and then another 2000 or so up to Bogachiel peak. Then we hiked out all the way down (except the 700 ft climb up from Hoh lake) on the final day. It took us about 3 hours to get from the trail head to CC #3 (we had already hiked out 6 miles that morning from Cape Alava loop so were tired). Then we took a good 4 hours to get from there up to Hoh lake, granted we stopped along the way to take in views and have lunch. It was nice having time to relax at Hoh lake and swim while the sun was up. Make sure you have enough water for this stretch as it’s very exposed and hard - we tore through our water here. The hike out was long and steep but I don’t think we would have wanted to cut that up and stay another night in the forest. I would love to come back on a clear (smoke free) weekend and stay the first night at Deer Lake, second night at Hoh lake, then hike out third day. 	Aug 14, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-16.4786100461
The Enchantments	Shaker	Obstacles on trail:	    .	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Beautiful hot smokey long hike. We hired a shuttle to take from the parking lot on Icicle Creek Road to the Stuart Lake Trailhead. Instead he took us to another trailhead 12 miles away and we didn’t notice until after he drove away. Saved by two sisters who drove us to the right trailhead, but lost an hour. Make sure you get dropped at the right place! Finally got to Stuart Lake trailhead around 7:45AM. Totally agree with previous report: gloves, poles, and water filter, and map. We lost the trail as we descended toward the trees just west of Snow Lake. There were several slightly scary spots along the trail going down in loose rock. We lost the trail again in the rocky area just before Nada Lake. You enter the rocks and switchback quickly to the trail instead of crossing the scree. The map helped us here. There are some trees down across the path in the last few miles, but easily ducked under or climbed over. We finished the last 30 minutes in the dark.  Beautiful, but views were obscured by the smoke. Better to do this hike on a clear day if you have the choice.

Tolmie Peak Lookout - Eunice Lake	Sophie Pritchard	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were terrible	Snow free	Subaru Outback cleared 10 miles of washboard and potholes. Drive up included 7 miles of stump ranches. Plenty of parking mid morning. Lakes clear and easily swimmable. Bugs were terrible. Horseflies, mosquitoes relentless. Bitten through and through! Bug spray ineffective. Beautiful forest, lovely scenery, wildflowers included pentstemon, paintbrush, asters, few lupines. Huckleberries not ripe yet. Amazing view from lookout despite very hazy conditions. Not for the faint of lungs. Did I mention the bugs? 	Aug 14, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-15.1840285174
Barclay Lake	GreatAmbino	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Carried my 15 month old with no problems. The trail has lots of rocks and roots along the way, but as long as you are paying attention to where you walk, it's not a problem. Great hike!

Candy Mountain Trail	crotalus309	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	This trail is entirely exposed and was more than 90 degrees by 10:30.  Bring sunscreen and a hat during a sunny day.   Air quality and visibility was poor from smoke.  I hiked the trail to the top and back from 9:15-10:30 AM and only observed three other hikers.  The trail is well-marked and I observed lots of quail and several species of birds associated with shrub-steppe habitat.  Good views of West Richland neighborhoods were present, but I couldn't see all the way to Hanford.

Hidden Lake	GoodKarma	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	Hiked to Hidden Lake near Mount Rainier on Tuesday.  Here are some notes: First, if anyone is thinking of this hike (or the Palidades Lakes), please be aware that there are no restroom facilities at the trailhead and plan accordingly.  We stopped just past the park's White River entrance. We followed the Palisades Lakes trail, starting across from the parking lot on the hairpin curve on the road to Sunrise.  The trail starts off with a downhill segment, which means that you will finish your hike with a final uphill push.  It passes a turnoff for Sunrise Lake and then passes Clover Lake (the largest of the group of lakes).  After that this trail gains and then looses elevation a couple of times as it goes over several ridges along the way.  The turnoff to Hidden Lake is well marked, or you could continue straight on to Palisades Lakes.  The final approach to the lake is an uphill climb.   Hidden Lake is nestled in a bowl with ridges that block any view of Mount Rainier, although that made little difference on a day when the smoke from wildfires obscurred any distant views.  One of the overlooking ridges has an impressive display of columnar basalt formations.  The lake was a little bit cool, but very nice for swimming once I dove in.  Very refreshing. The hike could be extended by taking the short spur to Sunrise Lake and/or visiting the Palisades Lakes as well.  	Aug 14, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-15.9431672177
Wallace Falls State Park	Elaine J.	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	We got to the trail head at noon and the parking lot was fairly empty - much to my surprise. Of course, it was a weekday. The trail starts out by walking under the power lines and then turns left and enters the woods. From there, we hiked the Woody Trail up to the lower falls. The trail is in great shape and provides views of the river below. The trail to Lower Falls was a bit steep for some of the older members of the group; however, the grade school kids had no trouble at all. The Lower Falls is lovely and gives you a nice view of Middle Falls. Lower Falls is a great place to stop for a picnic and rest in the shade of a beautiful picnic shelter. Most of our group decided to call it a day at that point; but, a couple of us went up to Middle Falls. We decided to take the Railroad Grade Trail back as it is an easier trail to go down to the parking lot. The day was very hot and because of the smoky haze, we could not see the views of the Olympics.	Aug 14, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-15.5207067574
Cougar Trails	BeaverDawg	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	This is a nice network of trails around the WSU Vancouver campus.  We needed to stretch our legs after spending time indoors most of the day (avoiding the heat and haze from wildfires).  We waited until after 7pm when campus parking is free and it had cooled down to the mid-eighties.  We've done some of the trails here before but were able to find some we had yet to explore.  The smoky conditions disallowed any views of Mt St Helens and Mt Hood which you'd typically see up on campus but it provided a huge orange sun/sunset. There is a large tree down on one section of trail which is easy to get under, but right after the downed tree, there is a wet stream crossing.  It would be very easy to cross if you wanted to get your feet wet, but we didn't.  We opted for dry feet and turned around and found another trail to continue our trek.  As we headed back up toward Campus we saw a coyote, looked like a juvenile, who stared at us for a bit until he/she finally trotted off.   From the scat we saw, I'd guess there are quite a few coyotes in this area. #hikeathon   	Aug 14, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-15.6094931730
Riverside State Park - Bowl and Pitcher Snowshoe	tdoyley	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	The basalt rocks here are incredible.  The trail was clean and groomed.  Saw osprey nest and climbed up rocks.  Suspension bridge is very nice. Even spots to swim. 	Aug 14, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-15.2126869267
Boardman Lake	mabeadnell	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	The road to the trailhead is long with LOTS of pretty big pot holes.  We have an SUV that made it just fine, and I saw a few sedans headed up as we were leaving, so anything should be able to make it, just take it slow. We got to the trailhead around 11am on a Tuesday and were the only ones at the parking lot.  My 12yo, 10yo, and just newly 5yo (it was a birthday hike) girls and I made it to the lake without issues.   The smoke from the fires were pretty bad making visibility poor, but it didn't seem to affect our breathing.  The girls waded into the lake, fished a bit (saw them jumping here and there, but no bites), and wandered around for 3 hours or so and then headed back home.  The entire time we were there we only saw 1 other couple.  Saw just a few mosquitoes and flies, tons of dragonflies, a handful of butterflies, and 1 GIGANTIC frog.   A great hike for little ones, will probably come back for an overnighter at some point with the kids.

Wetlands Trail	Stuke Sowle	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Another shorter loop on Tiger Mountain that would be great for those looking to try out trail running or just get in a short hike when time is limited. Started at the trailhead on Sunset Drive in Issaquah.  From there I took the trail that makes the 300' climb up the plateau, followed Power Line trail to Wetlands Trail and hopped on it.  From there it was easy cruising to Bus Line trail which is another wide, smooth trail that makes for easy travel.  Then to get the blood in the legs really going, I took the Nook Trail to Section Line.  Not a huge climb but enough to get the HR up!  I then jogged down Section Line to High School trail, took a left on Adventure Trail and followed it back to the trail that leads back down to the trailhead on Sunset Way. A nice five miler with a little over 1,000' of climbing!  I have included a link to my track for closer inspection.

Raging Creek	C P	Obstacles on trail:	    Overgrown in places.	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	The Forest is closed.  At least that's how it seems.  Yesterday, I went out to clean up Rock Creek trail (Lake Wenatchee) that I had hiked the day before, Chiwawa Valley Road was closed before the trailhead. When I came out from the hike I did, the road was closed even further down the valley.   So yesterday after finding the road to Rock Creek closed, I went back to investigate the trail I had found last week off road 6307.  Turns out, it is Raging Creek Trail, not the one I thought was Raging Creek off road 6306.  What that one is is still a mystery. Mileages from Chiwawa Loop Road, drive Chiwawa Valley (River) Road  2.4 miles to left on road 6300, at 5.8 miles (pavement end) go right on 6306, at 6.3 left on 6307, at 9.6 find old trailhead on left (wide spot in the road) and trail on right (cairn).  Drive another 2 miles to stub road on right with old fire ring and trail start behind bushes marked with orange flag (trail is just past stub, also on right). I spent yesterday cleaning up road 6307, effectively opening up another 3 miles to 2wd travel.  I figured since I was walking it anyway I might as well, then I could drive all the way up next time. Much of this little-used road was being encroached by trees and bushes, both from the sides and in the middle. I would clip until I got to a place i could park, go get the car, and so on. I clipped the sides and got rid of the woody plants in the center that were dragging on the bottom of my car, road can now be carefully driven all the way to the T.H. (11.6 miles from Chiwawa Loop Road).  Some of the plants in the center were quite old judging from the size of the stems, just stunted from being run over so many times. When I drove out yesterday, the Fire Closure signs had been moved down to right after road 6300!  Knowing the nature of these things, I quickly went to town for provisions and right back out, before they had time to close the road further down valley.  Spent a smoky night on the side of road 6307. Today was spent cleaning up the first 3/4 mile or so of trail.  I must have screwed up the clippers yesterday  because they wouldn't cut worth a damn, too much effort required.  You will know where I stopped.  Hiked up almost to the first high point (probably 1.5 miles), no views and "Hazardous" air quality discouraged me from expending too much energy. Trail is plenty hikeable despite lots of knee-high blueberry bushes, just wait until after the smoke lifts.  In Leavenworth you couldn't even see Icicle Ridge! When I came out today, the Chiwawa Valley Road closure was still in the same place, right after road 6300 (the one you want to get here), but Highway 207 was closed beyond the State Park (Chiwawa Loop Road still open).  So now you can't even get to Dirty Face.  I wouldn't be surprised if these closures last for the rest of the summer, when we get some rain.  So when you find you can't get to  Spider Gap, you'll have to try Raging Creek!  Nice, free campground (Meadow Creek) on road 6300.

Lake Ann (Mount Baker Highway)	granitemountain	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	With all the smoke around, the classic high divide hikes were ruled out so we did Lake Ann.  It has lots to see along the way, and at the finale, it is right up against Shuskan so we figured we'd get that payoff view; which we did.   Could barely see Baker.  Be sure to continue a bit past the lake, along the heather ridge until it flattens a bit and there is a great resting spot.   There was construction on Mount Baker highway just past Hannagan Pass Road and we were delayed a bit, and then it  was slow driving on gravel beyond that until Heather Meadows.  Will add that we did Yellow Aster Butte on 8/15 and the Northward views, while hazy, were still pretty good..

Mount Townsend	Goebs	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were terrible	Snow free	Bugs & Haze! Probably not the best day to hike although, we wanted to get one in and hopefully maybe find clear air. We were wrong. Road up to the parking lot was in good shape. Although the directions WTA provide and my Google Maps were different, so just be careful which one you use. There are a number of spurs on the trail, which could cause folks to get lost if you weren't paying attention. Small parking lot, but hiking on a Tuesday has benefits. For me the bugs were terrible and I worn even bug-spray for two. My wife had a number of annoying bugs, but nothing like my constant swarm of deer flies. Trail in great shape and easy to follow. Two water sources that were easy to get to, one at the beginning of the trail and one muddy lake by the campgrounds about half way up. After camp, it is dry all of the way to the top.  Definitly doing this hike again when the weather and haze improves. Overall, fun day.

Skagit-Sauk Reach Trail	parisrobin	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Arrived on a Tuesday at 9:30 am and finished at 1:30pm. Discovered a lovely, immaculate riverside camping park. Day-use bathrooms are near front of park and day-use parking is also further in closer to trail head. Started at large "TRAILHEAD" sign in SW corner and followed the mowed swath between two walls of clean, ripe, huge blackberries. At every trail junction we went LEFT, either to view river or to walk parallel to river and after ~1/2 mile of hiking got onto the river trail. There are a few steep but very short sections to climb through. Most of the trail is in shade with a few brief openings. The middle section had spider webs so waving trekking pole out in front was often helpful. The last aprox 1.5 mile section was more inland and very flat and easy to power walk through quickly. The fallen leaves of many deciduous trees makes for a soft trail. Trail ends at a road which parallels the river. We walked down the road 1/4 mile but saw no access to the shore. No other hikers on trail today. With extra side trails and road walking achieved 8.7 miles r.t. Enjoyed it and definitely worth doing especially to enjoy berries, park amenities, old forest, and the gorgeous color and sound of the Skagit. Great place to go jogging.

Big Gulch	ninjaracerchick	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Didn’t want to go up in the mountains with this heavy smoke in the air so I chose to try this system of trails. Easy to follow and well maintained, I parked at the 92nd park which puts you on the north fork. I walked down to the intersection with the south and west, followed the west then came up part of the south before heading back up the north to my car.

Olallie Lake via Pratt Lake Trail	Zipster	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Wildfire smoke haze was really bad today. I intended to go to Granite Mtn but decided that the air quality wasn't suitable for a strenuous hike. Instead decided to circumnavigate Olallie Lake in the clockwise direction.  At ~3 miles take cutoff to Talapus Lake, shortly after boulder hop over Talapus Creek then turn north toward Olallie Lake.  Toward the north end of the lake at water's edge, there's a very fine patch of ripe blueberries (see map waypoint in attached track file).  At the northern end of the established trail, there are a couple back country camp sites.  The boot trail connecting to Pratt Lake trail starts at the back of the uphill camp site after crossing a small streamlet.  Some might find this boot trail hard to follow as it goes straight up the hill.  Due to the steep angle, I was glad to be going up this trail rather than down, which one would have to do if going in a counterclockwise direction.  At the junction with Pratt Lake trail, this boot trail is not obvious. However, there is a small rock cairn at the junction on the uphill side of Pratt Lake trail (see picture and also see waypoint in the attached track file).  Once on the Pratt Lake trail, it was an easy and quick return to the trailhead. Flickr link includes trail pictures and hazy lake pictures, as well as flowers & berries.  Gaia link includes track file and waypoints.

Independence and North Lakes	Philip Palaveev	Obstacles on trail:	    Trees down across trail.	Road rough but passable	Bugs were not too bad	This is a wonderful trail that offers amazing views and two beautiful lakes. It is not an easy hike - plenty of climbing but the views are worth it. First of all THE ROAD - The road is very much passable and with some caution would be OK for most vehicles. There is a dried-up stream to be crossed, 0.5 miles into the Forrest Service Road. There are some bigger rocks there and it does require some caution. The rock slide mentioned in other reports is 3.0 miles into the road and has been cleared quite decently. There are many pot-holes - some quite sizable. That said - we had no trouble at all in a VW Tiguan and saw a couple of sedans make the drive. As noted, the first lake is easy and quick to reach and kind of popular. North Lake is another story. It is a good hour of climbing to the ridge through many switchbacks. Well worth it! At the ridge - views were quite affected by the smoke. Still a nice view but certainly not what I have seen in the past. You can only see the shapes of nearby peaks.  A minor note - when you reach the second little lake (tarn) you will see a stone-fall on the left. The path appears to continue straight ahead to another tarn but you need to look more closely to the left and recognize the cairns that will take you up the stone fall towards the second ridge. If you continue straight ahead you will reach a cute small lake that is also worth a short visit and has a couple of nice camping spots.  When you come to the top of the ridge you will quickly see North lake after a couple of turns. Here is a good place to ask yourself if you feel like the steep drop (and climb on the way back). The lake is beautiful when you reach there and we had it entirely to ourselves - all other hikers seemed to stop at Independence.

Little Si	CapnCrumples	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	Arrived at the trailhead around 5 PM and there was plenty of parking.  Only passed 4 pairs of hikers and a handful of rock climbers, and we had the top to ourselves the entire time.  I was hoping the smoke would make for some cool lighting at sunset, but there was just too much of it. The trail is super dry and dusty right now, so watch your footing in areas with loose rocks.	Aug 14, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-15.2660627934
Saint Edward State Park	Tibby's People	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Was invited to dinner at a friend's nearby, and took the dog to stretch her legs while we were waiting. Started by the intersection of Holmes Pt Dr NE and Juanita Dr NE. Took the lower route to connect up with the Entrance Trail. Down past the playground, picked up Orchard Loop to S Canyon to S Ridge to Beach to North and back to the Entrance Trail. Was getting dark by the time we were done, so finished the loop along the road. Twisted my ankle on S Canyon and fell, but was able to walk it off. Lots of smoke, especially noticable down by the lake, where the sun was red in the haze, but a good walk, on the whole.

Melakwa Lake	daugman	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	3 of us went on a smoky day.  We prepped for bad bugs and never had a problem (though in fairness we applied some cheap Off in the parking lot).  We left the parking lot at 830 and took 3 hrs total or 2.5 hrs moving to ascend to the upper Lake Melakwa.  (which felt a bit slower than normal for us).  The lake and surrounding peaks is beautiful; we saw quite a few fish jumping.  One of our group took a swim though it was of course cold. Our descent took 3.5 hours but that includes a 45 min detour to the set of falls that people swim at (about 2 miles into the hike, visible by a small boot path to the right as you ascend).   We had no trouble finding parking at 830; but as we exited in mid afternoon all the stalls were filled. Comment; the Lake and falls made it worthwhile, but i really hated the rockiness of the trail.  Our poles helped for balance though you really had to pay attention each step.

Mount Peak (Pinnacle Peak)	Ky Carter	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	We got to the trailhead around 7pm. There are two sides to the mountain, and we were on the side with the giant parking lot. There were only a couple other cars. When we walked up to the start of the trailhead there was someone coming down who was very inconsiderate and didn't have their two dogs on a leash, so they rushed up and got into my dogs' faces with their hackles up, which is very frustrating. There are always dogs off leash when I hike here. This was my first time going up this side of the mountain, and we ended up not hiking the gravel road up and instead navigated through the wooded trail. We didn't come across people besides a few runners at the beginning until our way back down, where there was a man sitting in a very secluded part of the trail. I would not do this side alone, especially as it was getting darker. There are always a lot more people on the other side. It got pretty steep at times, and there isn't much in the way of views or anything, so I always view this as a training hike. It is very smoky right now because of all the fires, so there was a haze and it was very stagnant and muggy.  	Aug 14, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-14.8410657821
Hope and Mig Lakes	Kronst	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	:  2.5 of 5 stars   :  This hike is a nice hike when the rest of the mountains are under smoke.  We swam in Mig Lake—a little chilly.  Mig Lake seemed easier to get in than Hope Lake and the bugs were not as bad as Hope Lake.  Lots of yummy blueberries & huckleberries.    Although the views of the mountains are under smoke, the views of the lake are not under smoke.   :  For any car. Easy to get to.  Parking along the road is fine.  NOTE:  Road construction along Highway 2.  Luckily it delayed our trip only about 10 minutes—no big trucks in front of us.   :  None.   :  Good.  Someone fixed the bad creek crossing—thanks!  Also, last year, I could not find the trail to completely walk around Hope Lake.  I needed to bushwhack for about ¼ mile & I don’t recommend it.    :  Not bad!  People who were leaving said they were bad, so they must have cleared up.  More bugs at Hope Lake, less at Mig Lake.   : This trail took us (60 & 51 years old) 2 hours to the top.  1 hour to explore and swim.  A little less than 2 hours down.   :  Nice lake views—smoke did not ruin the views.  Mountain views are very hazy—covered with smoke.   :  A few wild flowers.   :  In Sultan, the Sultan Bakery which has the best bacon that I have ever eaten!  Their home-made bread is yummy!  Their bakery stuff is superb!  They are open to about 7 pm.    In Monroe, Benjarong Thai food has an excellent Curry Salmon dish that is worth stopping for.  They are open to 10 or 10:30 pm.

Licorice Fern Trail	Tine	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	This trail is actually closer to 400 ft in elevation gain and goes up and down repeatedly, sometimes steeply but mostly not too bad. At the end of Licorice Fern Trail, continue on to Indian Trail where it levels out to flat terrain. Making stops at Far Country Falls and Far Country Lookout adds about 100 ft of elevation and 1 extra mile. I highly recommend doing the Far Country Trail for the beautiful mossy trees. This way, your total hike is just under 5 miles with about 500 ft gain. When I hiked here in August I was disappointed to see that there wasn’t actually any water in the waterfall, and the “lookout” is a bench where you can look through a tiny tree gap to see some nearby hills. It’s definitely not a panorama or anything dramatic, so keep expectations realistic. The most beautiful part of this hike are the stunning trees and mossy stumps. It’s very peaceful and shaded the entire way. I saw many birds. I only saw one other person on a Tuesday afternoon, and that was on Indian Trail. There were no flowers in bloom, but there were some blueberry bushes scattered around and a few interesting looking mushrooms.  The smoke and haze that’s covered the rest of the region is not present here. The trees must do a good job of filtering out the air. The Licorice Fern Trail is ridiculously humid; I was drenched the whole way until I reached Indian Trail, where it’s noticeably drier and cooler with an occasional breeze. Once I eventually turned around and went back down Licorice Fern, sure enough I was dripping again even on the descent.

Greenwater Trail to Lost Lakes	TheBairFamily	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Went for a day hike to a new alpine lake, although the air was not clear due to the fires, it was still a great hike. Not hard but not easy, especially with 40lbs on your back. Brought my ultra-light trout rod and I was glad I did. First cast resulted in a decent sized trout. Took a quick pic and let it go back. I will definitely go back, maybe for an overnight at Echo Lake.	Aug 14, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-14.9596828371
Franklin Falls	kmeredith	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Really nice little hike for my dog's first one! Trail is very well maintained and beautiful glimpses of the river along the way. We went earlier in the morning and there was only a handful of people on the way to the Falls, though it was much busier on the way out so get there early!

Wahpenayo Peak	Soundmirror	Minor obstacles posing few problems	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were terrible	Snow free	Hiked this yesterday with a friend. We started at the Eagle Peak trailhead and instead of going left up the trail to the saddle, we went straight on a faint trail toward Wahpenayo. It’s very easy to lose the trail. You’ll cross over big boulders/rocks which wont take long to cross, and then you’ll be hiking uphill in a beautiful grassy meadow. Look out for marmots and pikas. They’ll be greeting you with their cute little chirps and meeps. I’d recommend wearing pants just because there are a lot of trees in the way and you might be doing some butt sliding on some steep portions of the trail. I wore shorts and got by with only a few scrapes and cuts.  If you do lose the trail, just keep meandering around and you’ll find it eventually. When you are near the top, you’ll see what you might think is the summit, but it is the false summit. Just keep going and you’ll have a short sketchy rocky section to climb up. It freaked me out while going up, but it really isn’t a big deal and was much less scary coming back down. You’ll eventually descend about ten feet or so before coming up to the actual summit. It’s definitely worth it, so don’t give up if you attempt it. The views are pretty amazing! Unfortunately there was a heavy amount of smoke obstructing some of the views off in the distance. The air quality, however, didn’t seem too terrible. The bugs were absolutely horrendous! Bug spray probably helped a little, but they sure did make the hike a little miserable. Definitely bring a hat, sunscreen, and plenty of water. 2L was just enough for me. Poles are not necessary but you’ll be glad you brought them. I’m guessing we did around 9, maybe 9.5 miles round trip and roughly 3500-3700’ gain. Neither of us were tracking our mileage. I mostly hike solo, but this is probably not a trail I’d hike by myself. This is in the backcountry and you more than likely will not run into anyone the entire time. Be safe!	Aug 13, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-14.0560719438
Brightwater Center	Lukin66	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	I did a couple of loops of trail running here this afternoon. It was very smoky, and visibility was down to just a few miles. Despite the overcast look to the sky, it was hot and windy for the entire time I was here. All the trails are in great shape, though I did spot a CONCERNING number of cigarette butts discarded in the grasses. Everything is matchstick dry, and a discarded cigarette butt could very easily start a huge brush fire in this park.

Rachel Lake	Vanlea	Minor obstacles posing few problems	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Lovely hike to do in the warmer weather...lots of shade and water sources the whole way. My pup has been struggling with some of our recent hikes (sun exposure, hot rocks), so this was a very nice reprieve for us both. The trail is relatively mild until the last mile or so...then get ready to climb and scramble over roots and rocks and some downed trees. When you wonder if you are ever going to get to the lake, you are almost there! And it is worth the climb! So lovely and inviting, lots of great sitting areas to have lunch or a snack or a swim. The bugs were actually tolerable, too, which was a nice surprise! Next time, I hope to do an overnight. There are also other lakes to explore from here if you have the time. The hike did feel longer than 8 miles roundtrip, but with the views, the creek alongside the trail most of the way, the intermittent waterfalls, and the lake, I didn’t mind.

Goat Lake	mollywalnuts	Minor obstacles posing few problems	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Great weather, bug levels not horrific, and some beautiful lake views.  A nice, low key hike in. I’m neurotic about sunscreen 99% of the time, but the shaded trails with diffuse dalliances of sunlight made me comfortable going without sunscreen on the hike back.  Smelled smoke around 6 AM. Saw the lake socked in with smoke around 10 AM. Left on Monday around 2:30 PM.  I give it 4 out of 5 goats (only reason not all 5 was because it was pretty popular for a Sunday overnight)! Will return!

Chelan Butte	Emy Gaub	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	There are a lot of wildfires in the area so the view was completely obscured by the smoke. It was still a great hike but if you're in it for the view you may want to wait for the smoke to clear. Finished the hike in 1.5 hours up and 1.5 hours down. It gets pretty hot in the day but if you're back by noon it shouldn't be a problem.	Aug 13, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-13.9099812493
Heybrook Lookout	AlBuck	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Nice morning for hike to Heybrook Lookout. Managed to get to top of the Lookout right when sun was rising over the mountains. Arrived at trailhead at 6:30am, the trail is in great condition and total hike took 2 hours with stop at the lookout for 20 minutes. No bugs. Did not require hiking poles on way up but used hiking poles on way down for my creaking knees. I was the only hiker going up and down. Forest Service folks had stayed the night at the lookout, and did not mind me taking pictures from the best viewpoint on the lookout.

Harmony Falls	austineats	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	To swim in Spirit Lake seemed like something that I had to do. Alas it was not to be. After hiking Mount Margaret we did this little hike. It billed as the ‘only legal access to the lake’. This much was true but swimming was going to be more work than it was worth. Negotiating the logs was just too daunting.  We did read some cool fun facts about the eruption, which we didn’t know. The trail down to the lake is an old overgrown road. It isn’t as bad as that sounds, but isn’t exactly wonderful either. We hiked this trail in late afternoon and it was virtually completely in shade. A few berries, a lush seep half way down, and eventually the promised lake. Spirit lake is beautiful and impressively yoked in gargantuan logs left over from the eruption. Our biggest pleasure from this hike was the under-advertised Harmony Falls. Just before the lake was an awesome little waterfall. Icy cold water spills over a handful of hydraulically carved rocks. There isn’t much room to swim. But it is gorgeous, the day was at it’s end, and all was right.	Aug 13, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-15.9132839270
Lake George	JBarrette	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Almost immediately after entering Mt Rainer Nat Park at the Nisqually entrance, take a left onto Westside Rd.  The parking is about 3.25 miles up the road that almost immediately becomes dirt but is in excellent condition for all cars.  Very smooth. After parking, the road up to Lake George is also in great condition.  It is wide and about a 2-3% grade for about 4 miles.  At about the 2 mile marker, there is an area that is well developed with stone walls and other infrastructure.  It must have served a greater purpose in the past.  Its sad to see park areas get closed down.  Continue up the road.  After approximately another 2 miles, there is an opening to the left and a really cool log/steel rod bike rack.  This is the "trail" head to Lake George.  (TIP - next time, I would bring a bike.  It might be a pain pedaling uphill but the reward of coming down would be awesome!  I don't think you would ever have to pedal).  From the road, the trail to Lake George is easy to moderate and very well maintained.  It is only about 1 mile until you reach the Lake.  The camp sites there are in wonderful condition.  There is even a really nice, wooden shelter than could accommodate a large group of people in the wettest of conditions.  The only thing I would have preferred was a better water source.  I prefer to grab water from a moving stream.  The water in the lake was stagnant and we took the extra steps of boiling water.  Bugs were hardly and issue. The trail from  Lake George to Gobblers Knob (fire lookout) was also in great condition!  This trail is a little steeper but easy enough.  There are some nice views along the way but nothing in comparison to the lookout.  Amazing views!!!  Visibility was unfortunately reduced to all the fires but it was still spectacular.  I was surprised to that this trail had gotten 3 out of 5 stars.  I almost passed it by but it was the last overnight back country permit available and I'm so happy we did this hike. Yeah, the road up and down is less than glamorous but overall a great hike!  The road makes the distance much easier and the reward at the end is well worth it!

Pinnacle Peak	Keri Foster	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	This hike is inside Mount Rainier National Park. The trailhead is across from Reflection Lake. This is a good hike if you are already at Mount Rainier camping. The hike takes you into a saddle between Pinnacle Peak and Plummer Peak with a great view of Mount Rainier. It is strenuous, 3 miles round trip and you gain 1150’ in elevation. The first .5 miles or so is in the trees and shade. The last bit is rocky and uncovered. It is pretty steep but worth the climb. You get nice views of Mount Rainier as you continue hiking. We also saw some marmots, chipmunks, and wildflowers. The hike altogether takes about 3 hours depending on how much time you spend at the top. I wouldn’t recommend climbing Pinnacle Peak, it is quite steep and dangerous. You can explore Plummer Peak though! It is a bit of a scramble.

Swamp Trail	Stuke Sowle	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Put together this cruiser seven miler on Tiger before work.  Normally I wouldn't share a TR for something like this, but for those looking to perhaps dip their toes into trail running, this is a fun little loop with a lot of smooth single track and two climbs to get the quads burning a bit.  It also gives you a chance to swing by your car later in the  run at the High Point Trailhead.  Starting from High Point, you hop on the Swamp Trail and follow it to Ruth's Big Tree Trail.  This non-technical trail is wide, fairly flat and has some great forest views.  You then hop across the power road and take the Adventure Trail which is a bit more technical and has a little climb to it. Again, fantastic forest scenery. At the junction with the High School Trail, you take a left and follow it to the junction with Poo Poo Point trail and Section Line.  Here you get the blood flowing as you make the climb up Section Line.  But like the previous trails, it's smooth with little in the way to trip you up. You then hit a short section of the Nook trail before continuing onto the Talus Rock trail.  This fun section goes by some large moss covered boulders and has some short climbs and descents.  It will take you to West Tiger 3 where you can enjoy a mile or so of downhill on that wide trail.  Follow this to the High Point Trailhead where you can call it a day, or grab a snack at your car and continue on.   I took the small trail that parallels the road to the Cable Line Trailhead and then got a bit of grunt work in, climbing Cable Line to it's junction with Tiger Mountain Trail where I took a right and finished the run on the descent of Tiger Mountain back to West Tiger 3 and finally High Point. A final note.  Unfortunately on this run, I had my ninth encounter with an unleashed aggressive dog on this mountain in the last two years.   I can deal with music blaring, bad trail ettiquette and other minor things, but I draw the line when I am threatened physically by an unleashed animal.  This is completely unacceptable and unfortunately the incidents are occurring more frequently. Too often the owner is quick to accuse me for the dogs behavior, "You are running", "They don't like hats", "It doesn't like guys with beards".  This too is unacceptable.  It is your dog and your responsibility to ensure it is in your control.  Rant over. I have included a link to my track for those who want to take a closer look. 	Aug 13, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-14.1367612594
Thompson Lake via Granite Creek Trail	nancyritz	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	A lovely day hike to Thompson Lake,  where we saw zero people on a Monday.  This a great swimming lake,  with a lovely ripe blueberry covered island in the middle of the lake that makes for a great swimming destination.   There are several blown downs over the Thompson Lake part of the hike,  but nothing that can't be hurdled over fairly easily.  It is a strenuous hike,  with about 3400' of elevation gain, and over 11 miles of hiking.   We saw several frogs/toads on the trail.   Also amazing ripe berries of several kinds (thimble, blackberry, salmon berry, blueberry) trail-side.  The descent from the ridge into Thompson Lake looks daunting,  and it is a long downhill.  But the trail is easy to follow.  	Aug 13, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-14.4088572723

Lake Dorothy - Lake Bear - Lake Deer	AHL1	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	We arrived to a nearly empty car park at the trailhead at 9am (a Monday morning). We hiked up to Deer Lake, stopped there for lunch and hiked back to the trailhead- it took about 5 hours 15min (excluding the lunch break).  Was a lovely hike (no bugs and hardly anyone else on the trail). The path is really well kept and maintained. Easy walk to Dorothy Lake and then a tough route up to Bear Lake, but worth it for the lake views- so peaceful and calm!

Heather Lake	Linzlemon88	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Arrived 9:45am. Only 4 other cars at the trailhead. (This trail is off the same road as Mt Pilchuck - but Pilchuck has a different trailhead farther up). I didn't see a single person on the trail up. I arrived at the far end of the lake about 11:00am. The view from the far end is much better in my opinion. Huge rocks to sit on made a perfect place to stop and enjoy the beauty. Back on trail 11:28 and reached the parking lot just 58 minutes later.  Bugs were present, but hardly noticeable. Trail was in good condition. Easy to follow. This was my second time up. The first time was in February and the trail was snow covered so I never saw the lake. The trail gets very "rooty" mostly in the second half of the hike. Watch your step because it does get pretty slippery and it's easy to catch a toe under some roots (I totally did this... whoops). And to the person I saw wearing perfectly white sneakers... poor life decisions were made on his part. This trail can get pretty muddy. It wasn't too bad today, but there was still a fair amount of mud and water on the trail. It's not enough o get your feet wet, but enough to get your shoes dirty - but that's what trails are for! Many of the little bridges are in need of repair. You don't have to go through water, but the bridge along the far side of the lake is broken and will move when you walk on it. Coming back I passed about... 16 groups of people. Trailhead parking was nearly full when I got back to the lot.  Great short hike. This was my second time doing this solo. I like this trail for that purpose because it's not too long or strenuous and it's well traveled enough that I feel safe.

Goat Mountain	gemhikes	Obstacles on trail:	    Trees down across trail,	    Overgrown in places.	Road suitable for all vehicles	The smoke has moved in and settled down here. I was up on Goat Mountain a few weeks ago and sure glad I got some views in then - everything was totally covered in haze this time around. The only peak you could even kind of make out was Sefrit. We left the trailhead around 11:30am and decided to only go just past the lookout a little ways, which took us about two hours. There is a downed tree in the lower section of the trail that wasn't there the last time we were here, but it doesn't take much to get over it. The trail has also really grown in since our last visit in the stretch just past the forest and before the meadows - TONS of salmonberry bushes have really expanded out their reach! You can see the patches that the WTA trail crew worked on the last time we were up there but things are growing quickly. The flies are the worst in this section, as well, though if we kept moving it wasn't too awful (although it would have been nice to stop for some berry picking!). Speaking of berries, it's my favorite time of year when there's lots of eating - salmonberries, thimbleberries (tons at the trailhead), huckleberries, and blueberries all are ripe right now. Blueberries are carpeting the meadows above the lookout and the flowers are past their peak. We hung out above the lookout for a while doing data collection for a butterfly research project before heading down - didn't think it was a good call for our lungs to continue up the peak (and for no views, at that). We were back at the trailhead in 1.5hrs with a crazy orange sun poking through the forest here and there through the smoke.

Mount Forgotten	Lucy	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Today's initial plan was to go hiking near Mount Baker but after seeing the change in air quality from sunny to widespread haze, my hiking buddy and myself decided to hike closer to town. We chose Mt. Forgotten knowing that the views would be limited.  This hike has a lot of variety. You travel through forests, ridges, creeks and meadows. The trail can be level and smooth or rocky or rooty. There are very impressive old growth trees including huge cedars, firs and hemlocks. Various mosses cover the ground, boulders and trees. Along the way you cross several dry creek beds. Distant waterfalls are present. After approximately 3 miles from the trailhead you reach Perry Creek falls. From there you head up via switchbacks through nice woods to a saddle that shows views of Mount Forgotten. Today the haze obscured the surrounding peaks. Past the saddle, you continue further and reach beautiful meadows and wide open spaces. On a clear day many peaks can be seen from this spot but not today. Despite this, the meadow was very pretty and quiet. It was the perfect place to stop, sit and enjoy a well deserved break after the long hike up. We chose not to attempt the summit of Mount Forgotten.  Wildflowers and birds were sparse. Several cool frogs were seen. The mileage on this trail ranged from 10-11 miles depending on the app results. It was a great hike. We knew the haze was going to be bad before heading out. We also knew that this trail has a lot to offer without depending on the views up top.  	Aug 13, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-13.4676105177
Granite Mountain	atlanticsoutheast	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Today was 80 degrees and hazy, smoke was noticeable aromatically and visibly but not imposing. Challenging and hot. Almost as hard as mailbox peak. The trail is steep but very well maintained and easy to follow. I generally don’t take breaks on hikes but today I took three short stops for water and sunscreen! Started hiking at 11:50, summited at 2 pm. Got back to my car at 3:30 with probably 25 minutes of wandering at the top to get pictures. Three tiny streams were refreshing about a mile from the trailhead, otherwise no water to be found except the lakes visible from the tower. The lookout was perceivable closed with a rope running across the start of the little staircase and the opening from the stairs to the deck of the lookout was closed. Someone was in there but I figured if they wanted company they’d have the stairway open. With the haze I could see the surrounding peaks and two lakes and a little pond, everything else blended into the smoky air. Not many people out at all, I saw maybe 10 other people and spent the vast majority of my time on this mountain in solitude. Bugs were nearby but not very interested in bothering hikers except like three flies but they didn’t stay more than a minute or two. Lots of bugs to see, ants, moths, flying insects, grasshopper-like things, and butterflies. A few chipmunks, birds, a little snake (probably a garter snake), and something that looked like a badger? It made a sound that I initially thought was a distressed hiker with an emergency whistle. It was up in the meadow which was so green and scattered with some wildflowers. Looking forward to redoing this one sans haze.	Aug 13, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-13.1318864575
Heliotrope Ridge	granitemountain	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Very smokey day up here so we changed plans from Hannigan Peak to Heliotrope.    Went to the final water crossing to check it out; it is running very high and we opted not to cross; most people turned back.  Did see a pair hike up and cross.  Backtracked and went up the climbers trail to the climber campsite area where there are a bunch of stone windbreaks.   Lots of wildflowers of many kinds up this ridge; could even smell them.   The view of Baker was somewhat Ghostly with all the smoke; could barely see Skyline Divide.   Road is passable but slow going; many potholes.   A great hike even with the smoke.

Palisades Lakes	greybeard	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	If you want silence and solitude, this is a great alternative to the mob scene at Sunrise, but you'll have to forego the Rainier view.  With a forecast of haze/smoke, this seemed like a good non-view choice. Left trailhead 0830, comfortable 53 degrees. Passed 4 people on the way to Palisades Lake and had the lake to myself for lunch. The return trip a bit more populated, passed 33 inbound "hikers", including the same ill-prepared, ill-shod people typically seen in the afternoon at Sunrise. Flowers long-gone, a few isolated lupine and gentian.  Bugs mildly annoying only when I stopped to rest or bird. The bird list: Common Raven, Gray Jay, Clark's Nutcracker, Robin, Mtn Chickadee, Red-breasted Nuthatch, Dark-eyed Junco and lots of Yellow-rumped Warblers, Chipping Sparrows and Pine Siskins. Back at the car by 1430, temperature up to 72 degrees. 75% in forest, slight haze/smoke not an issue with the view. Save an energy source for the long climb out at the end.

Fossil Trail	Rod Hooker	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	This is an overlooked hiker trail I can recommend – moderate difficulty for the first mile then easier. Well traveled by horses but no shoe prints or bike tracks today. With the temperature in the mid-90s this August hike was 95% in the cool shade of a moderate growth forest. The trail starts in the north end of the Kalama Horse camp – walk 100 yards and cross the FR 81 to the trail signpost. Begin at 2,200’ elevation. The first quarter-mile is relatively flat then joins an old caterpillar track and ascends 30° for a mile with a couple switchbacks – this is the steepest part of the whole trail. The second mile is easier at a 10° ascent and by mile 3 is level at 3500’ (highest elevation). On the ascent and right side of the trail looms Goat Mountain (4,965 feet tall). It is NE of the trail and viewed from time to time through the trees. Essentially the trail follows The Fossil Creek Valley and contours around the western slope of Goat Mountain. There are no trails marked on the map for a Goat Mountain climb. Along the way the only opening in the forest are four avalanche chutes – easily traversed. At mile 3.3 the trail enters the Mount Saint Helens Monument boundary and follows it in and out for a mile. It is here the trail descends to Goat Marsh Creek – the only water source. On this part of the trail, now traveling east, a few glimpses of MSH can be seen.  The trail eventually joins up with Road 8123 and ends south of Blue Lake where the Blue Lake Trail and Toutle Trail can be accessed leading back to the Kalama Horse Camp; a 14-mile loop. The quality of the forest makes this hike. Patches of moderate and old growth Nobel & Hemlock Fir, and Western Red Cedar marks this as a mature mixed forest. Many large trees are >4’ DBH and a couple >6’. The tread is entirely ash/pumice and in many places the trail needs brushing, berms knocked down, the trail widened, and limbs trimmed. Long pants and hiking poles are recommended. No ticks. Wildlife: abundant bear and coyote scat, along with elk droppings. A report on this trail by Tom Paulu Oct 2, 2014 (The Daily News) says the Forest Service opened the trail in 2003 and it was built by Backcountry Horsemen of Washington.

Langus Riverfront Park	LFletch	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	I enjoyed these two trails on a run this morning, nice peaceful spot as long as you can tune out the white noise of the freeway (my huffing and puffing solved that issue). I arrived at 6:30, 1 other car in the lot.  Langus Trail is paved and flat. Spencer Island gives you two options when you cross over to it, the north/left side goes maybe 1/8 mile and becomes heavily overgrown. The south side, which is run by the City of Everett, has a loop trail that is a combination of bark, dirt, gravel, grass, moss, etc and while being encroached by some brush and grass at the southern end of the island is easily passable with only a few brambles to dodge. Saw a few herons and various smaller birds and rabbits	Aug 13, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-13.0023863213
Palouse to Cascades Trail - The Tunnel	CDLC Family	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Interesting day hike.  Found it disappointing that it is open to bikes, they think they own the tunnel.  Very rude bikers and the screaming kids.  Why don't parents teach their kids to respect fellow hikers.  This is one of those hikes that should be done when no one else is in the tunnel.  Other then that interesting hike.

Upper Lake Creek	greymstreet	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Kudos to all the teams that have put in so much work over the past few years clearing this trail. We were originally hesitant to tackle this loop in a single day after reading the sporadic trip reports noting various washouts and many down trees, but after we noticed the Forest Service website declared the trail obstacle-free just one week ago, we decided to give it a go. There are still a few trees across the trail in the upper portion of Upper Lake Creek, but none posed a real obstacle. We hiked the loop clockwise. Did not track our progress using GPS, and suspect some of these numbers might be high, but I'll provide mileage numbers along with my sources whenever possible: If you do hike any segment of this loop and manage to take an accurate measurement, I'd be very interested to hear your number!

Sunrise to Mystic Lake	mcr47	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Day out "running" out/back from Sunrise toward Mowich Lake. Largely runnable going out; more power hiking on the way back - net downhills have that effect. Water sourses were frequent enough that I probably could've gotten away with carrying only 1L.  The haze kept the sun reasonable, but there are enough exposed bits that I'd recommend reapplying sunblock a few times on a clear day.  The trail is easy to follow with one naive caveat: At the suspension bridge to Ipsut Creek Camp (or something of similar name), the Ipsut signs have been taped over with new arrows. Follow the new arrows. The park map still has the true Wonderland trail marked, but a bridge is washed out on the Spray Park side of the suspension bridge. Signs will tell you as much before you find the bridge. If you follow the signs to Ipsut, you'll regain the Wonderland trail. Rangers may tell you this, but I didn't ask and missed any pre-existing memos. Did Skyscraper on the way back - a nice bit of solitude for little extra effort. Pleasent folks out on the trail. Haze was thickenning throughout the day, but still quite tolerable at 7p. Thru hikers were uniformly pleasent, if that factors into trail ratings. Shout out to the New Hampshirite trail runner backpacking the loop. Enjoyed chatting. Hope you get to run some trails out here soon! 	Aug 13, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-14.7677564001
Hidden Lake Lookout	Pugermeister	Minor obstacles posing few problems	Road recommended for high clearance only	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	Due to the fires from Winthrop and Twisp, the North Cascades (NC) is covered in smoke. Highly recommend staying away from NC until fires are contained and smoke clears, especially with sensitivity to smoke or asthma. Views are obscured by smoke. 	Aug 13, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-14.7857046057
Green Mountain - Gold Creek Trail	Forestscout	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	I went up the Plummer Trail and it looks like a lot of the trail has been redone. There are a lot of new logged areas to go through with a bunch of great views of the Olympics unlike on the Gold Creek Trail which is all in the woods. I didn't meet a single person on the Plummer Trail. At the summit I got an amazing view of forest fire haze. If it wasn't there, you can see Seattle. Then I went back down on the more popular Gold Creek Trail and saw quite a few people.	Aug 13, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-14.3070895048
Big Four Ice Caves	karnage	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Uneventful hike to and from the caves.  The air quality was poor and the mountains were hard to see.  There were blueberries and thimbleberries along the trail with some spirea and alum root blooming.  Got a few bug bites, so bring your spray.  The trail was getting very busy with groups of camp kids at about noon.#hikeathon	Aug 13, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-14.8781002395
Chain Lakes Loop	piperh	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Intermittent snow - not hard to cross	Decided to start Chain Lakes at Artist Point. Got to the parking lot around 7:00AM and there were about 15 other cars in the lot. We really couldn't tell what the best way to do this hike was, so we just picked a route and hoped for the best. We went counter-clockwise and started with descending the Wild Goose Trail. It's a pretty steep downhill. From here, we crossed the road and the parking lot before we began the ascent up to Herman's Saddle. The climb up to the saddle this way is a slog - its pretty long and steep, but the views are really nice (and would have been much nicer without the smoke). I really didn't realize how long of an uphill section we'd have before we reached the saddle - I'd estimate its around 2 miles of uphill to reach the saddle. At the saddle, we could very faintly see Baker. Such a bummer because we could tell it would have been an amazing view if it wasn't shrouded in smoke and fog. :( From here, we headed downhill to the other lakes below and then began the much gentler and shorter uphill section that leads back up to the ridgeline and the junction with Ptarmigan Ridge. After that, it's a little over a mile of flat ridgeline hike back to Artist Point. I think if I wanted an easier hike, I would have gone clockwise from Artist Point to avoid the longer climb from Bagley Lakes to Herman's Saddle. Approaching the saddle from the opposite direction seems like it would be easier, but since I've never done it that way, I can't say for sure. I can say that the large majority of hikers were going the opposite way of us! Definitely will be back to this hike in the fall for better, less-smoky views!

Burroughs Mountain	Dynamic Tension	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Hiked to 3rd Burroughs today. At 10:00 the parking lot at Sunrise was about a third full on this Monday. Close to completely full when I got back around 3:00, although you could still have found empty spaces. Skies were slightly hazy, then cleared up, then got pretty hazy again. By mid-afternoon, you could hardly see the mountain from the parking lot. View of the mountain was good, though, the entire hike. Lots of people on the Sourdough Ridge trail and milling around near Frozen Lake. Quite a few on the way to 1st and 2nd Burroughs, with well over a dozen at the top of 2nd on my way outbound. Several groups trudged onwards to 3rd Burroughs, and several were already returning on my way up. However, although I did not have the summit all to myself, there were only a few other parties up there during the hour I spent eating lunch and enjoying the views. I'm always marveled by the sheer size of Rainier right there in your face on 3rd Burroughs. Passed many people heading out on my way back. A herd of goats was feeding west of Frozen Lake, which was a nice bonus sighting. Round trip time was just under 5 hours, including at an hour lunching and sightseeing on the summit.

Margaret Lake	jtmeow	Obstacles on trail:	    .	Road rough but passable	Bugs were an annoyance	The road going up wasn't too bad; I made it in a Subaru sedan. The trail doesn't begin from the parking area; you have to continue walking up the road past what appears to be the trailhead. The trail is rocky but not too difficult. I made it to the view of Keechelus then was unable to locate where the trail continued from there. Everything that appeared to be a trail ended up leading to thick overgrowth. I searched for the trail a while before I decided to turn around. Not sure where I went wrong. The air was smokey, so the view was obscured, Rainier wasn't visible. I hope you have a better experience than I did, the Margaret lake looks lovely from the photos I've seen.	Aug 13, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-13.3378457204
Goat Lake	abkoch	Minor obstacles posing few problems	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	My hiking partner for the day and I called an audible on the way to our planned assault on Mt. Pugh because even by 6:00 AM driving on I-5, it was clear the smoke was going to be really bad today. Headed to Goat Lake instead to stay a little lower and have the possibility of a good payoff despite poor visibility. The road in is passable for all vehicles, but some big potholes at various points, especially after the turn off for Goat Lake definitely would require lower clearance vehicles to take it really easy. Just fine in my Subaru though. Got to the trail head around 7:30 to see only a few cars that were clearly overnighters. The hike up was glorious with nice cool temperatures and beautiful forest despite the haziness. A few blow downs over the trail but all are passable by ducking underneath. Also a touch muddy in a few areas, but nothing bad. Mosquitos were a bit annoying at the trailhead and during brief stops along the trail, but no bugs at the lake. Just before the lake, we stopped by the waterfall and then again to take in some spectacular light on the creek just above the falls (the one sort-of-good thing to come from smoke is fun lighting). At this point, we could smell the smoke strongly and could tell it was less fun breathing while working up the last slightly more uphill section.  Ran into the couple groups who had spent the night at the lake, but quickly headed over to the day-use section to spend a while taking in the lake, which was extremely calm and peaceful in the morning. The haze was such that we could make out Cadet Peak, but it was not clear and even seeing across the lake was not clear at all. Nonetheless, it was very beautiful and we were glad to have such a satisfying alternative hike for a day when being up on a peak would have been pointless and not enjoyable. Only encountered two small groups of day hikers on the way back up (benefits of hiking on a Monday!!).	Aug 13, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-13.5915167664
Iceberg Point	hikingwithlittledogs	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	I told my daughter I was going to write a whole trip report about the outhouse at Agate Beach. It went something like this... Agate Beach Outhouse, how do I love thee, let me count the ways... and she said, “PLEASE don’t do that,” and I said, “but it’s awesome and I love it,” and then she used it and said, “it is pretty cute,” and that I say is the highest praise an outhouse can receive.  A compliment from a 16 year old.  Kudos to the community volunteers who maintain this little gem. There aren’t a lot of hikes on Lopez but there are plenty of places for a nice walk.   To get to Iceberg Point you park at Agate Beach.  They’ve added a few more parking spaces which is nice.  Walk a couple blocks down the road until you see the sign and gate on the right side of the road.  The walk through the woods is shady and cool.  Almost like walking through a green tunnel in places.  There’s a map when you get to the end of the woods.  Doesn’t really matter which way you go.  It’s all beautiful and perfect for just wandering.   It was hot and hazy today but we turned the bend and a nice breeze blew in.  Pack a lunch, bring your binoculars and enjoy.

Mount St. Helens - Monitor Ridge	calixtomoon	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	First time ‘climbers’ here. We started in the dark at 506am with seven liters of water btween us. We played leap frog through the forest with a group of happy girl scouts from Tacoma almost all the way to the top.  The forest was pleasant mellow hiking, even in the dark. Sunrise, as we exited the forest was an awesome orange orb due to smoke. I spotted a deer silouetted high on the ridge. The boulders were not bad scrambling (although seemingly endless) on the way up, but slower and harder going down.  Gloves were super helpful. Got a few small but annoying cuts or nicks before donning the gloves. Gaiters were not needed, but good boots and long pants were a good choice.  I used poles for just a few minutes and found them more of a hindrance than anything because the boulders required two hands and the sand was easier to slog up and slide down rather than using the poles (I would still take them if I did it again). We made it up in five hours.  The last few hundred feet were the hardest. I imagined I was actually mountain climbing, taking five steps and resting before doing it over again. The top was so close but it took so long to get there!  I was feeling silly about it until I was on top watching others coming behind me struggling the same way. One man went to his knees in exhausted happiness after he made it to the top. We shared the ridge with about 13 people after the scouts arrived. We were spread out so it did not feel crowded. A woman told us that there was a snowmobile down in the crater. A high-marking casualty from years past. But we didn’t see it. Views of the surrounding area were limited due to smoke, but it was still awesome to see the beauty of the crater and the glaciers and feel a bit of unease at the steam, gurgling gasses and rocks constantly falling down the slopes. My partner coaxed me along the ridge toward the highest point until I surrendered to my fear of narrow ridges and turned back. It was windy, and sunglasses did not protect the eyes from the ash and sand blowing about.  Goggles would look like overkill but would be much more comfortable. We spent one hour on top and then it was three hours down on exhausted legs. Glad we started early, because LOTS of people were heading up as we were going down. We drank five of our seven litres and never saw a ranger.  It felt like heaven peeling the boots and socks off at the parking lot. We had ambitions of exploring more of the area after showering and dinner, but ended up lazing and napping in our room at the Lone Fir Resort for the rest of the day🤭😴. I was glad that we had splurged on a room for the pre and apres hike instead of tenting👍🏽.   This was a great adventure and feeling of accomplishment!

Mount Margaret	austineats	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	I’ve taken the Norway Pass trail and the Boundary trail every few years since the mid 90s. Since this area is in the heart of the St Helens eruption zone, it has been through a long phase of ongoing change. It is always interesting to see how the plants will have changed, which flowers will be dominate, and most importantly, how many berries there are. The berries did not disappoint on this visit. Our original intent had been to hike the vertiginous ridgeline of Mount Whittier. The trail to this junction is relatively uneventful, although there is one spot that has washed out and requires care. The length of this trail has great views of the blast zone. The turn off to Whittier is at a pass. Looking northward a long, pale colored ridgeline stretches nearly 2 miles. It’s impressive south face rises steeply nearly 2000’ from the Coldwater Creek drainage. After we traversed the first few hundred yards of this lightly used trail my partner cried uncle. The thought of two miles of steep and exposed was just too much. Back on the Boundary trail we turned our sights to Mount Margaret. This former fire lookout has a suitably rocky summit and was a great lunch stop. We found no remnants of a lookout other than amazing views of St Helens and Spirit Lake. From a promontory alongside of the trail on our return, we saw ~30 female and juvenile elk resting in the meadows below. Earlier in the day I had been tempted to enter this area north of Spirit Lake and south of the Boundary trail. There seemed to be many trails and water available down there. Then I noted my map designating this area ‘off limits’. I was happy for the critters to have a spot away from mankind.

Nisqually Vista Loop	Martin Ralya	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	This is a super-casual hike, perfect for kids. The entire trail is paved and gently graded, and it's well-maintained. Even the lookout areas are paved. Almost the entire hike is at least partially shaded, too. The ratio of mileage to amazing views on this trail is unbeatable, and it delivered the best views of Rainier I've had since moving to Seattle. (My previous favorite was from the summit of Mount Si, but being this close makes a huge difference.) At different points along the trail -- included several dedicated lookout areas -- you see slightly different angles of the mountain, as well as the full depth of the valley, the falls, and of course the Nisqually Glacier itself. It's a mind-blowing view in every way. If someone said "I don't hike much and I'm going to be in Paradise, which trail should I do?" this would be my recommendation. Parking is limited and Paradise is popular, so do watch out for that. We arrived at 11:00 am on a Monday and both lots were already full; we wound up a short distance down the road from the upper lot, and by the time we left there were cars parked at least a half-mile down that road.

Black Peak	gobozov	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Intermittent snow - not hard to cross	Climbed Black peak last weekend. Started at 7:30 am Saturday from Rainy Pass TH, reached Wing lake around 11. Plan was climb NE ridge of Black peak same day, but we decided wait one more day for better weather. Next morning weather was more even cloudy, we decided climb south ridge instead NE ridge. There is some snow before the ridge, slope is pretty steep, we used crampons and ice axes. Ridge scrambling (class 3) is obvious, there is one class 4 move before the summit. Climbed down same way.	Aug 13, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-14.0608475836
Washington Pass Overlook	Cagey	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Our annual trip to Winthrop fell a little later than usual this year, but after a stop at Cascadian Farm Stand for ice cream and a stop at Newhalem for sandwiches, we decided to stretch our legs (and paws) at Washington Pass Overlook.  The air was thick with smoke from the surrounding fires and visibility was significantly reduced.  The trail itself was easy to navigate.  The upper lot was about half full and the temperature in the mid-70s. The pup report: while no water was found on the trail, the walk was short enough only a small water bottle was needed.  Some unevenness in the trail but nothing unmanageable.

Cascade Pass and Sahale Arm	SuperH	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	This trail was hiked on 13 August 2018.  To get to the trailhead, there is a thirteen mile gravel road.  The road was recently regraded - as a result, there is a "washboard" effect that can be uncomfortable due to the vibration, and you may intermittently lose traction due to excessive wheel bounce.  Please slow down and take your time - there are also large potholes, and some patches where the road surface was recently repaired due to winter washouts.  While I navigated this road with a 4x4 truck, I found it to be less than optimal as I had hit my jounce bumpers several times, and rarely exceeded 20mph.  However, I also observed many smaller vehicles making short work of this road - even vehicles as small as a Mini Cooper Type S.  Once at the trailhead, overall, the trail conditions were excellent - no complaints at all; extremely passible.  Unfortunately, due to California's uncontrolled pollution problem (it is on fire, if you were not aware), elevations exceeding 7000' are quite smoky.  Accordingly, you cannot see much from Sahale Glacier - so this time, I turned around at about 6,650' elevation.  Regardless, it remains to be a beautiful hike.  If it is your first time up, I would recommend waiting until the smoke clears, as it is absolutely gorgeous. Some notable things about this hike were: 1. The Cascade Blueberries and Black Huckleberries were ripe, and as delicious as always! 2. At about elevation 5200 feet, there was a North American Black Bear spotted.  It was just scaling up and down the mountain - many people were taking photos.  However, please remember this is wildlife - please keep wildlife wild!  Although black bears may look tame, it is best not to take your chances.  Be equipped with bear spray just in case. 3. There was a Mountain Goat spotted at approximately 6700 feet.  It was just grazing on minerals on the ground (as Mountain Goats do). 4. There were many Hoary Marmots observed - beautiful creatures, herbivorous - they will let you get close for some great photo opportunities. 5. At elevation 6,200 feet, there were some beautifully velvety Columbian Blacktail Deer, just grazing on foliage. Something of note: One hiker saw the bear my friends and I saw, and mentioned that she had seen several other bears at a lower elevation, including two American Black Bears and one North American Brown "Grizzly" Bear on one of the side trails (neither statement could I personally confirm).  While I wish that I had been fortunate enough to see a brown bear in real life - those bears you definitely want to keep your distance from.  Remember - this is approximately the Washington-state lower boundary for those bears, so their presence is still very possible. Bugs were good throughout most of the trail, but at about 4000' and higher - the bees were stinging and the flies were biting.  If you are allergic to bees, please take the proper precautions.  If you are annoyed by flies - well, you are just like everyone else.

Lake 22	Matt Coleman	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Two Things: 1. Leash up and pick up after your dogs!! So much dog poop on the trail, and NONE of the dogs we saw were leashes up. Luckily they were friendly. And loads of large poop piles on or next to the trail. Gross. I have 2 dogs and don’t mind if people take theirs hiking, just play by the rules.  2. Please abide by the pack it in, pack it out rule. You might think that banana and orange peels are fine because they are decomposable, however, they are not natural to the area.  End of rant. Just be courteous, folks!

Hannegan Pass and Peak	Tiger Hiking	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	This was my first trip up to the pass and I opted to not go to the peak. I wanted to spend the night on Ruth Arm for a more isolated stay. The scramble from the pass up to the arm is a hand over hand scramble, but only for about .15 of a mile. After that the trail flattens out and there are several spots available. I circled my camp spot in one of my pictures.  I have to say that that I was disappointed, though, with all the smoke. There was a WTA work crew working on the trail, thank you!, so the trail is in good condition. There many spots available for tents, which is good because it is a busy spot. There must have been 50 cars when I got there on Sunday, most we're day hikers though.  Without the smoke I would have had good views in two directions and stairing right at Ruth. It was about 5.6 miles from my car to my camp sight, but watch out for that steep climb. 	Aug 13, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-13.0376215300
Sammamish River Trail	HikingLove	Obstacles on trail:	    .	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	We started our walk at Bothell Landing Park and headed across the bridge. We walked to Wilmont Gateway Park. There was construction work in several places along the trail. The first spot was right under 405, not sure if they’re moving the trail over. The second spot was about a quarter mile later where they are doing work on the bank to prevent erosion. They have made a gravel path where bikers have to dismount. Just before Wilmont Gateway Park you have to go through a little construction tunnel. The path will be detoured from 8/20-8/31. My 4 year old daughter walked some of the trail. It can be a little intimidating when you have bikers flying by you but a lot of the trail has grass along it which is good for the kids to walk on to avoid the bikers. There were a lot of ripe blackberries along the trail. We saw blue heron, a lot of ducks and geese   We are hiking to support the trails for hikeathon. Please consider supporting our trails so they are around for future generations! 	Aug 13, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-13.6229263737
Cherry Creek Falls	CiscoKitty	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Honestly this was not my first choice but my sister had a time limit so with that in mind we ended up here. I was pleasantly surprised and enjoyed the hike. There are many trails leading off the big main one that could make this confusing. Stick to the larger trail and you’ll be fine. The last fork in the road we went right, yellow car right there, and that is the shortest distance to the falls. The left trail will get you there but is longer and could be more confusing. When we left we took the other trail back (a loop) and right above the falls is a steep climb that I would rather climb then come down so I’m glad we went the way we did.  The falls are nice by not full. The one on the left is gone. The dog swam in the water but we did not. It’s definitely cold and on a hot day would be fine to just sit in to cool off.  To preach the LNT, Leave No Trace, principals someone had an orange at the falls and left the peel. Not cool and I picked them up for you and disposed of them. Pack out what you pack in and yes that means orange and banana peeks, apple cores. Well you get the picture. I was called out on this at Lake Ingalls by my friends. Embarrassing in person but I’ve never done it again.  As we headed out there were many people coming in with lots of kids.

Kendall Peak	RyanDix	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Absolutely loved this hike! Beautiful scenery, gradual elevation, awesome views, plenty of wildflowers and wildlife (pikas and marmots).  Got to the trailhead at 7am and there were a bunch of cars in the lot. Mostly overnight campers on the PCT that were already somewhere in the mountains. Took me about 2:15 to get to the top of Kendall Peak. Approximately 5 miles in, look for a VERY large stump partially in the way of the trail, with roots extending over the trail. Very shortly after this, you will see a narrow but defined boot path going straight up to the right (I lazily made 2 cairns on my way down to help mark this). Check out   for a picture of the stump and an in-depth description. The "scramble" is more of a steep, loose hike. 10-15 minutes max, and pretty steep. It was damp, so the dust issue was fine, but it definitely can be dangerous on the way down with the loose rock. I didn't have to use my hands once on the way up, but used them several times on the way down. The views weren't too much because of the smoke, but signing the summit register was pretty cool, and I'm glad I went up there.  Seeing pictures of the katwalk has never left much of an impression to me, but I thought I'd go check it out anyways. I am so glad I did that! Pictures cannot do it justice, but in person it is quite a spectacle to behold. However, it's sort of a bummer to turn around in the middle of a trail and call it a destination. Oh well! Decided to take the commonwealth trail on the way back for a change of scenery, and to shave off some time. Don't be like me, and take a wrong turn. After crossing the creek once, you will come to a man-made log bridge. Take this to the left, crossing the stream again. I went to the right because my GPS had the trail cross the stream a ways later. Well, the trail I took dives straight down and drops you off in private property off of Erste Strasse. I ended my hike with a 1 mile jog of shame along the road and back into the parking lot :)  :)  :)   Really cool trail though!

Sauk Lake	ravennspirit	Minor obstacles posing few problems	Road rough but passable	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Sauk Mountain is always a worthwhile (and popular) destination for good reason; wildflowers galore, short hike with a great view payout. Despite having hiked to the old lookout site many times over the years, I'd never taken the trail down to the lake. With a partly cloudy forecast, my friend and I decided this was the day to explore the lake trail since the views seemed to be uncertain. Road is in relatively good shape, a few potholes here and there. The section just a few hundred yards before the parking lot/TH seemed much worse for wear than it was when I hiked here a month ago. If the giant ruts and erosion look intimidating in a low-clearance car, there are several places to pull out and park before the rough section. The A-frame outhouse looked like it had been thoroughly cleaned recently, and was fully stocked. Following the Sauk Mountain trail, we reached the top wearing our raingear. With the mist and drizzle, there were not many people on the Sauk Mountain trail today. We back-tracked to the cut-off for Sauk Lake. The sign marking the trail is totally gone (weird, it looked brand new-ish a month ago. Theft?) but the junction is not hard to spot. The trail heads down moderately steeply (the description at the TH reports -1300' in 1.5 miles), and is quite rocky. It seems much less traveled than the Sauk Mountain trail, and is a little overgrown in places. Sturdy footwear is recommended, and gaiters if hiking after a good rain. There are multiple marmot colonies, and they have dug out burrows in several places on the trail, ankle turners for sure. While the wildflowers were crispy and finished coming up Sauk, there were multiple wildflower meadows still blooming on the lake trail. Ripe salmonberries, with low mountain blueberries not far behind. When we reached the lake, we were thrilled with the lovely wildflower meadow that encircles the lake. There is a small bootpath through the meadow, and several non-LNT campsites right on the lakeshore. However, following the bootpath to the outflow, there is a steep root-y trail that leads upward (rope was attached to assist with the short climb) that leads to about 6 great campsites in the trees. These were a little more LNT, but it is clear that locals camp/fish here regularly. Quite a bit of cooking/fishing gear was stashed or hung from trees. The fishing looks good here, we could see some nice sized rainbow trout swimming near shore and jumping to catch flies. I was surprised at how much bigger and deeper the lake is from the shore, a much different perspective than the usual one from the mountaintop. The only company we had were the many marmots, and an osprey that seemed to be feeding a family; it made 4 successful catches during our lunch break, and kept coming back for more.  Slogging back up the 1300' of switchbacks was not as bad as I had thought, but this and the rougher trail conditions are probably what keep this beautiful lake from being over-run.

High Divide - Seven Lakes Basin Loop	patrickvdh	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	Our permit for this hike required a bit of extra hiking/time but it was well worth it. We stayed night 1 at Appleton Pass - a 2300 foot additional climb and night 2 we stayed at Hoh lake.  As a result, we did not have time to head down into the lakes basin.   Appleton Pass is worth the climb as the tent sites are plenty so if you are really eager to get this loop in and there is no where else free, I'd suggest coming up to the top of this lovely pass for the Evening.  The bugs were minimal.   The second day we hiked from Appleton back down to the Divide trail and then back up hill.  Lunch was at Heart lake. A few miles later we came to the junction to Hoh lake and headed on down.  Hoh lake is a true beauty and with only a few other campers near by, I highly recommend this spot.  We sat and watched a few bears on the far shore, played games, had a nice swim and enjoyed the quiet.  While there are plenty of bears here, none came near our campsites or had much interest in us.   The third day we hiked what seemed the eternal down hill back to the falls and to the trail head. A bit bummed to have missed the lakes basin but we can come back another time now.   The only downside of the entire trip was the smokey haze from canadian wildfires (see pic).  	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-15.1448059363
Strawberry Mountain	austineats	Obstacles on trail:	    Overgrown in places.	Road rough but passable	No bugs	Great notions sometimes come from the simplest of things. Our vacation plan has us in the St Helens area and I was digging for another day hike. Looking for the usual suspects (a new trail, a fire lookout, perhaps a lake to swim in) I alighted upon Strawberry Mountain. It once had a lookout, we hadn’t been through the area, and towards the end there is a potential lake for swimming! Now all I have to do is convince the partner of my hike-loop-with-a-bike-back-to-the-car idea. Finding our trailhead was not as simple as I thought. We passed the Norway Pass Trailhead (where we left our bikes for the return) and headed north on FS 26. This road promises “road closure in 7 miles”. Following the usual half dozen mapping sources we followed FS 26 northward on its’ potholed course. Soon we were at the Ryan Lake turn off which we knew to be too far. We spent ~45 minutes hiking around this trail (see my Ryan Lake report). Back on the road we found the trailhead, unsigned, on the east side of the road. There is parking for several cars and no facilities (other than facili-trees). Our planned loop was to include FS #213, #220, and the Boundary trail. Reports that we’d read stated, “over grown”! We were prepared for the worst. Amazingly, we discovered that the first two trails have recently been completely brushed!! Despite a few spots, which need to be benched, this trail is in great shape! Our day was full of wildflowers, an absolutely insane amount of berries, and views of St Helens, Hood, Rainier, and many others. The hike up #213 to the ridge is loose pumice at times, but never terrible. There are multiple streams as well if you’ve brought fido. Reaching the ridge you’ll be tempted to head north but south is the way to go. The trail bobs and weaves through the ridge for a few miles. It is not without it’s navigational challenges. But, OMG, can I say BERRIES!? Blueberries, huckleberries, salmon berries, thimble berries, wild strawberries, and black raspberries (although I ate every single last one of those). The fire lookout location was fun to visit. We had lunch there. There are many volcanoes on view along with numerous lesser peaks. We spent much time contemplating the 1980 eruption and the subsequent forestry management. Winding our way down FS #220 quickly had us to the boundary trail. We turned west and dusted of the last 5.5 miles. We had planned a swim at Ghost Lake but couldn’t muster the energy. These last few miles are unmaintained. There are many blowdowns and it is overgrown in many spots. This didn’t stop it from being beautiful though and the berries were crazy!! After returning to Norway Pass a quick 4.5 mile bike ride had us back at our vehicle.	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-15.3584483088
Jolly Mountain	Vanessa (Finder) W	Obstacles on trail:	    Trees down across trail.	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Jolly Mountain, Humerus  Hill, and Sasse Mountain Distance: 7.4 mi. Elevation Gain: 4400 ft. We started hiking along Sasse Mountain Trail from the upper trailhead at about 9:30 AM. We continued straight at the junction with the Jolly Mountain Trail. We followed the trail mostly east on a simple, straightforward, and partly shaded hike until we reached the north ridge of Jolly Mountain, then headed south along the ridge to the summit. We reached the summit of Jolly Mountain at 11:15. We saw one dirt biker on the way up and two other hikers as we were leaving Jolly, but that was it for the day. After enjoying the views over an early lunch we hiked down from the summit and then continued left (south) along the Yellow Hill Trail toward Humerus Hill. This trail was particularly rutted out by dirt bikes so it was slow going. Quite a bit of the surrounding area burned in a 2017 fire so there was a lot of sandy ash on the trail also. We curved around the west side of a subpeak and then chose a random place to climb left along the scree slope toward Humerus Hill. We reached the top at 12:45 PM. It was a short climb up and the views were pretty good. Mount Stuart was subdued by a smoky haze. From here, Craig gave me the option of returning the way we came like sane people, or going completely off trail between Humerus Hill and Sasse Mountain in order to take the Sasse Mountain Trail back to the car. I’m always eager to do a loop hike and Craig made it sound pretty easy, so I agreed to go rogue. We returned to about the halfway point between Humerus and Jolly and then turned left (southwest) on a relatively shallow slope toward the creek below. The vegetation on this slope was all completely burned away and the soil was quickly eroding, so our steps were pretty slippy and slidey. We made it to the creek below, over several downed trees, around 2:15 PM. We decided it would be easiest to follow the creek, but it did get challenging as we continued to descend because of thick brush in places and many downed trees. At one point while we were hiking in the partially dried creek bed, a rock tumbled and I landed with both feet ankle deep in the water. Most people consider it a bad thing when they suddenly plop their feet in the water that they’ve been meticulously avoiding for quite a while. But my old pal Two-Sticks taught me that this is actually the “Freedom Step”, because you no longer have to work to avoid getting your feet wet. So I decided to go with this more cheery outlook and happily plodded through the middle of the cool, refreshing creek in my trail runners. Craig managed to stay dry by skirting along the sides. After quite some time, we reached the West Fork of the Teanaway River at 3:15, which we easily crossed and began climbing west along the valley toward Sasse. We probably should have just stayed in this valley, but we decided to climb to the northeast ridge in hopes that we could easily walk along the top. But our hopes were dashed – the ridge wasn’t really navigable so we ended up sidehilling along the steep sides of the ridge. By the time we were halfway up Sasse, I was beginning to get pretty Grumpe. The issue was that almost everything we stepped on all day either sunk, rolled, or wobbled, so the stabilizing muscles in my legs were completely spent. The main thing keeping me motivated was thinking about eating the chicken that Craig had roasted the night before. Anyway, after what felt like the span of human existence we reached the summit of Sasse at 5:30 and… it was kind of an eyesore. The fire hit this area especially hard so all the trees were dead, and the views were obscured by an ongoing fire. We didn’t linger long before heading back down the Sasse Mountain Trail. Despite only being a year since the fire, a lot of the trail was buried underneath ash and fallen pine needles. But as long as you don’t do anything super wacky, you will be able to go in the general correct direction. We ended up a tiny bit below the car, so we turned right on the road. We finished at 6:30 PM.	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-14.0083099499

Bandera Mountain	PNWGeorge	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	The road up to the TH is in great condition, no pot holes and my Mazda 3 had no hard time getting up there. Arrived at 10:30am and lot was packed so we parked on road with about 20 others. One bathroom available. Trail is clear of any obstacles and really easy to be on. Thank goodness for the clouds otherwise this hike would have been so incredibly hot. The last 1.5miles are literally scaling the mountain through the beautiful field. (See picture) and well worth it but hard! We had our 75 pound Golden Retriever and although he did fine, a lot of potential to have him trip and hurt his paws either sliding on boulders or getting stuck. I wouldn’t bring him again. Only 1-2 streams/ falls for him to dip in. Bring a lot of water especially if sun is out. No views of Rainer but saw the lakes and surrounding peaks. The last 200 yards or so are somewhat hopping to boulders and can be sketchy so be careful if you had kids on their footing. Take your time coming down. Alot of people had poles and one can see why! Awesome hike and will do again!	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-14.6393366533
Hibox Mountain	jheidel	Obstacles on trail:	    Trees down across trail,	    Overgrown in places.	Road suitable for all vehicles	This was a fun afternoon scramble, though quite brutal given the unusually high humidity. This trail has some excellent solitude; I only ran into one group coming down, despite the dozens of people I passed on the Rachel Lake trail. The view up top was excellent, though somewhat hidden by the haze from nearby wildfires. Still, there were excellent views of Rachel Lake, Rampart Ridge, Alta Mountain, Three Queens to the north, and Chikamin and Lemah Mountain to the northwest. As long as you know where to turn off the Rachel Lake trail, route finding isn't too difficult. I'd definitely recommend having the coordinates for the turnoff or a geo-referenced map. I forgot to mark the turnoff point on my GPS, but luckily I was able to find it from what I remembered from the satellite view of the route. The turnoff isn't marked, though it's a distinct trail. Overall, the scramble route is well defined, though there are a couple areas where the trail crosses downed trees where the correct route may not be that obvious. The ascent is quite steep, gaining 3000ft in a little over a mile. The summit scramble wasn't too bad, probably at most a class 3, though there's some exposure in places. Some of the rock on the summit block has been weathered significantly making it loose, so double check your hand-holds. I'd also recommend a helmet if travelling with a group. I made a couple radio contacts from the summit (73 de KI7QIV) and headed back down to the car. A couple people I talked to were stuck in the bad I-90 Sunday traffic. Roughly 7.5 miles round trip, 4000ft elevation gain / loss, 3 hours up, 2 hours down. Photos:  Map: 	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-13.1466443973
Mirror and Cottonwood Lakes	trailcat101	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	To get to the trail you have to make an initial ascent on foot up a very rocky road since most cars won't make it to the actual parking lot.  This part isn't too fun but it gets better right away after that. I once saw a couple drive an actual monster truck up to the parking lot that's right by the trailhead here, but I couldn't imagine taking a typical suv up there.  This is a great hike for folks who are new to hiking/backpacking.  We took family including an 11 year old who hadn't been out before and everyone enjoyed it.  The lake was beautiful and the trail is in great condition, plus you have the PCT to explore in either direction once you arrive.  We found ripe blueberries at the top and a bunch of ripe huckleberries on the far side of the lake where the PCT continues south.   Last year we found someone had left a 30+ gallon storage tub full of junk and a large bag of trash near one of the far campsites.  It looked like the tub was still there this year (or maybe it was a new one).  We hiked some of the trash out last year but didn't have capacity to help this time around.  Please remember leave no trace principles and help pack out trash you encounter to help keep this beautiful spot pristine.

Van Trump Park	cantwait4snow	Obstacles on trail:	    .	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Left the trailhead around 9:20 on Sunday 8/12, and all the parking was taken, with a couple of cars on the side of the road. This was on an overcast cool morning with a sunny forecast. Overcast weather was pleasant, but we still got a little too much sun, so I'm sure a sunny day requires sun protection. 2L of water was plenty of each of us.  We really enjoyed this hike!  TONs of wildflowers up above Comet falls. Salmonberries and thimbleberries below Comet falls, tart black huckleberries below and above Comet falls, and sweet, delicious blueberries starting to ripen in the meadows at Van Trump Park and above.  Deer, marmots, pika, and lots of birds.  There were flies and gnats at the top, but really not that bad.   The view at the very top of Mildred point is breathtaking, especially on a clear day.  100% worth the effort, and really not too crowded above Comet Falls, especially compared to the Paradise area hikes.  #hikingthestate	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-13.7325681257
Rattlesnake Ledge	Mel123	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	We hiked this trail on a Sunday morning, arriving at 10:00am. We got one of the last parking spots available in the parking lot (we expected there to be a lot of hikers so we were planning to park on the street). There were many, many people on the trail and for the most part there was no issue with passing slower parties or sharing the trail with the flow of traffic. All hiking levels are on the trail and so there can be backed up lines of people at times. The view is beautiful up at the top -- the breeze was really nice after the final steep incline. We stayed for a little snack and then headed back down. At this point it was about 11:30am and there were a lot of large groups (8-12 ppl) walking up the trail together, and unfortunately sometimes not making space for the hikers coming down. Otherwise beautiful hike; the trail is very well maintained and the views are outstanding. 	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-13.4521522783
Headlee Pass and Vesper Lake	hardly	Trail difficult/impossible to navigate:	    Difficult stream crossing(s),	    Muddy or wet trail.	Road rough but passable	Before heading out, please re-read the hike description, it is accurate. There are definite challenges on this trail, and it's not for an inexperienced hiker! I was very surprised by the percentage of hikers yesterday in tennis shoes; highly recommend hiking boots or approach shoes on this trail. Because it had rained the day before, and some of what had been trail dust became lightly muddy, some sections became quite slick. I suspect that as things dry out again as August continues forward, this challenge will be mitigated. Second, the description is not kidding about rocks getting kicked free and bounding down the mountain as you head up, or down, the steep section to Headlee Pass. When this happens, please yell, "ROCK!" as a warning to your fellow hikers below! There is only snow at the very top, just as you approach the mouth of Vesper Lake, and even then, it's not much of a challenge in boots. Didn't feel the need for micro-spikes. Because of the trail conditions, and steepness, definitely recommend hiking poles.  On the upside, the views are spectacular! Also, the hikers were all friendly. And finally, it's that time of year where the huckleberries are ripe, and no, I'm not telling you exactly where. Go find 'em yourself! :-) Lastly, on the Forest Service road getting there, it's bumpy, and there are two sections with large holes that would require some maneuvering to avoid getting high-centered. Not that big a deal, but worth mentioning.	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-13.5772035225
Mount Adams South Climb	CoryTDF	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Intermittent snow - not hard to cross	After years of talking about climbing this mountain I was finally able to get up there and do it! There were 4 in our party and we started at 1245 hours. The trail is great for the first few miles but becomes a bit hard to see under a headlamp once you make it to the first set of tent camps. It really came down to there being several veins to the main trail and we must have taken the wrong one. Luckily it was not hard to get back on course. The snowfield crossing leading up to the Lunch Counter was not complicated but it was a little tricky to know where to go in the dark as we had never been there and were only guessing where to go. Luckily we could see a few lights and that allowed us a bit of a guide. We stopped for a bit to eat and put on our crampons. It was a brief stop as it was brutally cold and our sweat was making it even worse.   Walking up to Pikers Peak was brutal. It became instantly clear why so many people make this a two day trip. We were about 2/3 up to the top of the peak before we saw any signs of life from the Lunch Counter and then all at once the flood gate opened. It was not long before people with legs much fresher and obviously stronger than ours passed us up. The climb up Pikers Peak claimed two of our group as one stayed with the other whom had to stop due to injury. For my partner Johnny and I the top of the false summit was extremely hard earned. The flat that leads to the final accent to the summit was in good shape with a well-established trail that could easily be navigated without crampons. The snow ends and the finial climb is completely bare leaving you to fight through the sand and rock. By this point my whole world was revolving around trying to get 10 foot sections completed before taking a break. I was completely exhausted and also struggling with a bit of nausea. Honestly I was not having much fun in that moment. At 0850 I found myself standing atop the old watch tower and was filled with a great feeling of accomplishment. The weather was fantastic allowing us to see Hood, St. Helens, Rainier, 3 Sisters, and Jefferson. It was really something! Our decent was simple enough. We were able to glacade from Pikers Peak all the way to the rock outcropping directly across the snowfield from the Lunch Counter. We made it there without holes in our pants or packs so I count it as a success. The snowfield below the Lunch Counter was soft with the late morning heat and it was a bit of a pain under very tired legs. Lots of sliding and falling. We were very happy to hit solid ground again. The rest of the trail was pretty strait forward. We met back up with the two that had turned around right at the Morris Creek crossing and from there hiked to the parking lot ending our hike at 1300. It was a very long 12 hours but so fun and great memories. Make sure to stop at the little café in Trout Lake and get a huckleberry milkshake. It is a well-deserved treat after such a great accomplishment.    	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-13.7035484461
Colchuck Lake	rsharr	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Did this hike as a day hike this past Sunday. What a gorgeous destination! Reminded us of Glacier NP in Montana. The road to the trailhead had some loose gravel and shallow potholes but was easily passable for all vehicles. At 8:15am on a Sunday, there were 2-3 parking spots at the trailhead itself, though there were also plenty of vehicles parked down the road, presumably belonging to folks who were backpacking from previous days. We took it nice and easy, stopping often to take photos and breaks, as we had one hiker in our group who didn't have great shoes or hiking experience - 4 hrs up, 3 hrs down. I'd estimate that an experienced group could plan for maybe 2.5 hrs up, 2 hrs down. Sounds of rushing water and glimpses of a creek for the first two miles are really nice. Washed my face at one of the stream crossings to freshen up. Not many edible berries left at this point in the season. Practically no bugs on the way up on a cooler morning, but definitely buggier on our way back around 3pm. This hike is mostly shaded so we didn't have to worry as much about sun exposure/exhaustion. But, that also means that the payoff for the most part in terms of views starts pretty late. Around the 3-mile mark, (I think just a short climb past the 5000-ft elevation marker) we stepped briefly off the trail and onto some boulders to the right for some trail mix and views of the surrounding mountainsides. I would agree that the trail rates as hard, if only for short chunks. Some of the boulder fields are a little more of a scramble, around the 2.5-mile mark and toward the top. Hiking poles were appreciated in most of the rest of the hike though. The last half mile or so is definitely the steepest, but so worth it. As is often the case, I actually thought it was easier going up than coming down. The lake itself was absolutely gorgeous. Not super sunny on this particular day, but that gave it a more peaceful feeling rather than a festive one. Other hikers on their way down said that the wildfire haze was better than  the day prior. When we returned to Leavenworth after the hike, the haze was insane, and we were glad that it didn't affect our hike. One hiker seeing her first glacial lake rightly described it as "otherworldly". We walked along the lake to the right after taking in the initial views. A 5-7 minute walk brought us to even better views of the lake and glacier and a couple possible paths to go down to the lake, some easier than others. The easiest paths were going down to a cove on the side of the lake. We all took a refreshing (read: brief and chilly) celebratory dip before we had our lunch. One adventurous soul swam for a few minutes! It was definitely a cleansing experience, and we agreed that it made the descent much more pleasant. This was our first hike in the Enchantments, and I hope it is the first of many!	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-13.8675733734
Heliotrope Ridge	Smokey's Helper	Minor obstacles posing few problems	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	The road is fine but there are some potholes and some places with rough, broken pavement.  You'll find them just when you think you can drive a little faster.  The trail is in great shape.  The recent rain kept the dust down, but it wasn't muddy (it was still very dry under the top layer).  Blueberries and huckleberries are getting ripe in the woods. I went to the hikers' overlook.  The creek after the turnoff to the climbers' route was high.  The water was turbulent and I couldn't see the bottom.  I tried probing a few spots but kept finding deep holes.  I almost didn't cross until I saw a couple and a dog coming back and was able to see where they crossed (downhill from the trail).  The water was about knee deep, but with the splashing from the current I got wet to my thighs.  Poles were a must for me and the crossing wasn't for everyone.  I saw some folks go upstream to look for a crossing, but did not see them on the other side.  Many others chose to sit by the waterfall and enjoy the view from there.  Besides the climbers practicing on the seracs below, I was the only one on the other side during the time I stayed. The reward for crossing was more waterfalls, lounging marmots, broad-leaved willowherb  in full bloom in the creek gullies, and views of Mt. Baker and the Coleman and Roosevelt glaciers through the swirling mist.	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-13.8009107910
Tubal Cain Mine	LJ&P	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Getting to the trailhead, we actually drove by it the first time. We only saw a sign for Gold Creek, not Tubal Cain. Got up to Silver Creek, realized we went too far and headed back down. At 9:30am, we got the last parking spot in the actual lot. By the time we got back to the truck at 2pm, lots of cars had parked along the shoulders and there were no spots really available.  The trail was in great condition with the exception of one downed tree across the trail but easy to climb over. The trail was well maintained, very gently and soft, only a few patches of rocky areas. We ended up missing the Tull Canyon cutoff and went all the way into the camp ground which added a couple miles to the hike but kind of funny to see parts of the downed aircraft used as a bridge or table.  Turned back and found Tull Canyon, not really sure how we missed it the first time except the signage is off to the left and up. I must have just been looking down at the trail. The climb up to the aircraft is fairly steep and rocky. Once you get to the clearing that the plane remnants are at, the bugs made their presence known. Just a quick poke around, it was pretty foggy, and back down we went.  This hike would be amazing during rhody season - the trail was lined with them for the first couple miles. I would definitely be interested in continuing on to Buckhorn Lake at some point but will have to work up to that!

Skyline Trail Loop	demonstrate	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Intermittent snow - not hard to cross	We didn't see lupines a few weeks ago and decided to visit this trail again this year. We found a spot in the parking lot around 9:00am. It was overcast but we did have fun. Unfortunately, we still don't see any lupines blooming.   Yes, we saw leaves of lupine but no beans no flowers. Other flowers were also off peak now and would be gone in no time. As   pointed out, there has been high temperature and low rainfall this year, which leaves lupine little water to flower.

Fragrance Lake	Jeff Bottman	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Some useful beta ... we hiked the "two dollar trail", which has less elevation gain / distance than the standard trail as described in the WTA hiking guide.  550 feet / 3.4 miles round trip.  Very nice, smooth trail, with some nice views to the San Juan Islands and sound.  Small, cute lake, with an encircling trail.  Looks like a good swimming spot on a warm day.  Zero bugs!  A great mellow, low effort hike, just enough elevation to qualify as a spot of exercise. 	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-12.1333969992
Sauk Lake	Muledeer	Minor obstacles posing few problems	Road rough but passable	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	I've been to Sauk Mtn many times, but never hiked down to the lake. Well curiosity got the best of me and Ravennspirit and I  finally hiked down to the lake. The trail forks off of the Sauk Mtn trail right after crossing over the ridge. Sadly, the sign pointing to the lake trail was missing, not just down, but completely missing! You can't miss the trail tho, it is the one going steeply downhill. It is actually pretty good trail, as steep trails go. No root ladders or large rocks, but some loose rocky scree. The trail takes you down thru some lush wildflower meadows, before entering a wooded area with fir and mtn hemlock. At one point there is a spur trail to the right, I believe it may be the old Sauk Mtn trail coming from hwy 20. I did not see any of C P s flagging tho, so not sure. Anyway stay on the main trail to the left.  Once thru the woods, enter a meadow filled with fireweed and false hellebore (also called corn lily). There is the lake, but you still have a ways to go. The trail keeps switchbacking down, skirting around the lake above a small boulder field. Up just a little, then the trail drops you down to the far side of the lake close to the outlet stream. Unfortunately, there are some campsites by the lake made by hikers that don't abide by the LNT principles. There are also some campsites on a bluff overlooking the lake, some of those have been well taken care of. Wisps of clouds kept playing peek a boo with Sauk Mtn, but we did get some views from the lake of the mountain top we'd been on before. The lake itself is a beautiful little lake with lots of flowers blooming along it's shores. There was still just a bit of snow on the opposite side of the lake. This is a bear hunting area, but we didn't see any bears or hunters. We did, however see lots of marmots! They were still in family groups, you could see the young ones playing and foraging while the larger adults sat on rocks as lookouts. We also watched an osprey hunt above the lake, catching fish. If you do this hike remember, all the downhill must be regained on the way out, all 1300'   Hikeathon: Help me support our trails by donating to my hikeathon fundraising page.  give.wta.org/Muledeer 	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-12.9407652267
Pear Lake	wildphyre619	Trail in good condition	Road recommended for high clearance only	No bugs	Snow free	Note GPS coordinates take you to Heather Lake, NOT Pear Lake. 	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-12.1406718296
Iron Goat Trail	R2T2	Obstacles on trail:	    Overgrown in places.	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	 Started from the trailhead off of Hwy. 2 (the one with the big caboose) about 9am. Only two other cars in the lot.   Headed up the switchbacks... about 600ft in just under 3/4 mile gets your blood pumping, but won't wear you out.   Once up to the main Iron Goat Trail, it's all railroad grade for the 3 miles to the old Wellington town site. Pretty quickly after starting up the trail, the Windy Point viewpoint appears. Nice view here to Hwy. 2, as well as the newer (still in use) railroad tunnel. It was still cloudy, so the surrounding mountains were in hiding. Back on the trail from the viewpoint, you'll turn a corner and find an old, abandoned tunnel. You can enter the first few feet of the tunnel, up to where it's fenced off. As with most of the trail, there are interpretive signs here describing the history of the railroad and the area.   After the this tunnel, the trail becomes quite overgrown. It's never so thick that you can't find the trail, but if you go, as we did, just after a rain shower, you're going to get very wet. There is a nice break from the overgrowth as you travel through a quiet forested area. Bugs are not too bad, but the few that were around liked to bite.  After leaving the forested area, you're back in the narrow, overgrown trail until you reach the super-cool, 1/2 mile-long concrete snowshed. Again, there are interpretive signs here, describing the story of the 1910 avalanche which killed 96 people.   After the snowshed, you'll reach Wellington. Just a few remnants of Wellington remain as you pass through the former townsite. But keep going a short distance to find the west portal to the first Cascade Tunnel. More signs here with information about the tunnel, as well as warnings to avoid entering.   Then it's back the way you came, being especially careful when heading down the switchbacks, as they're quite steep and rocky.   All in, we totaled just under 9 miles and around 900ft. gained. GPS did not like the tunnels, and especially did not like the concrete snowshed... made the track on our apps go a little wonky.   --also, if you have the need, there's an outdoor (no walls) vault toilet near the Windy Point viewpoint. Interesting place to 'go'--	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-12.7823438052
Kendall Katwalk	mayamandyam	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Great hike today! It wasn’t that steep, and the Katwalk was totally worth it. We were in the clouds almost the whole time, so there wasn’t really a view, but it mostly kept the bugs away.	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-12.1028530443
Spray Park	emeraldyellow	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Intermittent snow - not hard to cross	Did the hike up to Spray Park. Continued onward to visit the beginning area of Observation and Echo. All in all a 10.66 round trip hike by way of the All Trails app recording. Unsure of the elevation. We decided not to try to get up and around either Observation or (more desirably) Echo due to the snow fields and our lack of crampons. All in all just an amazing playground out there. By afternoon, the clouds had settled and visibility was almost impossible, so we were glad to be back to the car. It was nice stopping at the falls on the way back, too.

Paradise Valley Conservation Area	ninjaracerchick	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	I’ve been mtn biking here many times, but since it’s hike-a-thon I hiked it for the first time. There are so many trails here that you can go many times and never have the same experience. Combined a few of the hiking only trails I had never been on and a few of the smaller hike/bike trails. A little over 3mi in a pretty forested area. Make sure to snap a shot of the map if you’ve never been, though the markers are pretty informative on which way to go. always leave your car empty, I’ve seen glass on the ground a few times.

Heybrook Ridge	wafflesnfalafel	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Walked the new-ish Heybrook Ridge trail on a still a bit drippy Sunday morning.  Just a single car in the nice, big gravel lot at 7:30 AM.  Sani-can in the lot is currently functional.  The trail is in great shape and very nicely built - sturdy and functional but not overdone.  Trail distance is exactly as advertised with mileage marked along the way and a nice bench about halfway up to take a load off for a bit.  There is some road noise from Hwy 2 along the first bit but once away from the road all you can hear is the river and the breeze in the trees and an occasional train rounding the tight horseshoe curve at Index.  Forest is mostly scrubby second gen dog hair hemlock and cedar.   There are a few peak-a-boo views of the Index wall cliffs but the good views don't start until the very end of the trail.  Super nice views east up the valley and south across to Bridal Veil falls, (the ongoing logging that has the Bridal Veil falls and Lake Serene trails closed currently is very evident just west.)  The powerlines kinda mess up views west.  However, the powerline path does offer the interesting possibility of following them east all the way to the Heybrook Lookout a little over a mile east.  Don't miss the two block walk from the parking lot over the bridge into Index for some more views, (and maybe a snack at the general store if it's open.)   	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-12.1238609064
Wallace Falls State Park	Mack Hall	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Over all a great hike!  We arrived at 9AM to a half full parking lot. The first stretch of the hike under the power lines was filled with blackberries. Grabbed a few with the kids and a few for the dog and entered the woods.  We took the Upper Wood trail in which is longer that the lower river trail but is very easy. Not many people on the upper trail. We dropped down at the Railroad cutoff trail about 2.5 miles in. From there it was about .5 miles to the Lower Falls overlook. Lot of people on the trail. Falls were beautiful! The way back had a lot of people but was otherwise pretty with lots of views of the river. Parking lot and road was full on the way out at noon.

Cherry Creek Falls	tanalan	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Went on this Aug 12, Sunday morning, starting around 9 am. Took about an hour to get to the Falls. This was a super chill trail -- quite straightforward walking trails and nothing too intensive. There was a broken down car, which looks to seem more like a piece of art at this point, given how long it's been there, which is interesting. Not much to say other than that! It's a nice trail :]	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-13.5984847928
Mailbox Peak	seattlehiker18	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	This is the second time my friend and I have hiked Mailbox. We are weekend hikers who enjoy a lot of elevation gain. The hike yesterday was very pleasant given the hot weather recently. We arrived around 11 AM and found a spot in the main parking lot. The trail was not busy and we only saw a few people and dogs. There was a lot of fog at the top and virtually no view of Mt. Rainier--which was okay given the cooler temperatures. There were very few people at the top, most likely due to the "bad" weather. It took us about 2 hours to get to the top and the parking lot had emptied by the time we got down, around 4 PM. It was great the second time around! 	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-13.6262192983
Minotaur Lake	Blpnwadventurer	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were terrible	Snow free	Like everyone says, the mosquitos were awful! I reapplied repellent a few times and I still got bit. Definitely a lot of bugs once you reach the lake as well. This hike was definitely one of the hardest hikes I've ever done. Just because it's only a few miles, the elevation makes up for it. My legs were wobbling on the way back down. Hiking poles are recommended. The view though, definitely worth it. It was beautiful.  Nothing compared to seeing it with your own eyes. 	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-13.1122368059
Tolmie Peak Lookout - Eunice Lake	klare	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	No bugs	Snow free	Wow! What a beautiful trail! I left around 5:45am out of Seattle and got to the trailhead around 7:45. No really large potholes in the road, but it was super long and annoying. My little hatchback was going ~20mph on it and was fine though I did see an group changing a flat on an suv. Just know that those vehicles aren't immune to how rocky that road can be, so go slow. I did see the ranger leaving right when I was pulling into the lot, so please be aware that they do check for passes! I didn't see anyone on the trail after I started until I got to Eunice lake. It was really peaceful and empty, quite foggy until I started the climb to the lookout when the clouds started burning off Rainier. It was one of the best hiking experiences I've had to see Rainier revealed like that in the early morning! There were about 10 people up at and around the lookout when I got up there, and plenty more I passed on my way down. Probably took 1 1/4 hours for me to get up, even with picture breaks. I was back in Seattle by 1pm.	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-13.8925835076
Silver Peak	svanandw	Trail in good condition	Road recommended for high clearance only	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Great hike! The road to get there is tough on the car. SUVs are best adept to handle the road conditions but I would have been concerned taking my sedan. The trail head could have been better marked. If you are coming up the road, it’s on your left. The hike gets a bit challenging in the end with a steep incline filled with rocks. The view from the top is great albeit we had fog that limited views.

Mirror and Cottonwood Lakes	SMSweitz	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Parking is the only mild challenge for this easy, lovely trail through bursting huckleberry and wild blueberry bushes and 90 year old trees. Clearly a family friendly trail with lots of kids on foot and in carriers on the trail.  Mirror Lake area was chilly enough for down jackets today, but the water was warm enough to soak in for hours. 	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-13.7590506450
Lake 22	Wanderlustering WA with Dogs	Obstacles on trail:	    Trees down across trail,	    Muddy or wet trail.	Road suitable for all vehicles	I was needing a short and simple hike as it was supposed to be a cloudy day so I got a late start and canceled a longer trip I had planned to go on. I had not been to Lake 22 in a very long time so decided to give it a go as it is not a very strenuous trail. Arrived in the parking lot just past 3:00 pm, the lot was packed. Bad timing on my part because the trail was very crowded with hoards of people descending from the lake, not many people going up at this time. Would have been better to hike either a couple hours earlier or later. As others have said, a lot of people were not knowledgeable of proper trail etiquette and were not yielding the right-of-way to uphill hikers. Not cool. Many, many dogs on the trail today, all but one were on leash and all but one were friendly and non-aggressive. A couple other hikers made some unfriendly comments about why everyone feels they have the right to bring their dogs on trails but most hikers were very positive. No left behind pet waste and people were prepared with poo bags so that was nice to see. The trail itself is very rocky, rooty and wet almost from start to finish. Had to do a paw check once I got back to the car; my pup's paw pads were tender but not cut. This is not the most comfortable trail to hike on but once you get to the lake, the sore feet (and paws) seem worth it! Started my hike at 3:15, arrived at the lake at 5:00 on the dot (should have taken less time but as aforementioned, many hikers heading down as we were heading up). Spent ten minutes snapping photos (I decided not to walk around the lake) and then headed back down. Was back to the car around 6:20. All in all, a short and easy hike. The lake was serene and beautiful and the chill mountain air was super refreshing!	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-12.1877774866
Lake Valhalla	Greenlake Power Walker	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	It took about 2 hrs driving from Seattle. Got to the TH around 10am, almost missed the “exit” coming from Hwy2 EB (via Smithbrook trail). That left turn sneaks up on y’all of you’re not paying attention. Parking lot was full but we parked along the side; there were plenty of spots. Hiked with two young kids (like we do most Sundays; read my other reviews), it took about two hrs. This was such an easy simple hike. This was perfect for my kids after the “harder, steeper” trails we’ve been on lately. The lake was gorgeous, we went down to the sandy beach area and they played and played for about an hr. As more people arrived we decided to head back. It took us about two hrs to get back to the car; they kids were DONE hiking midway back (LOL).  On our way down we saw a lot of groups heading up, I hope they got back before sundown. When we got to the parking lot around 3pm, there were about 40 cars.  This trail is def a hidden gem. Get there early, the FS rd. was the best road I’ve driven on. No dusk kick up from the car, easy trail (not steep at all AND it intersects the PCT!), beautiful lake, plenty of camping spots, but no bathroom- there is one once you get to the lake tho. Will be back to do an overnight! 	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-12.8034004154
Lake 22	akabanana	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Beautiful! Hiked with husband and dog today, trail was a little rocky at times but definitely doable, even though this was pup’s first real hike. The lake at the end is wonderful, and warm enough to swim in. The trail is well maintained and goes completely around the lake, includes wildflowers and lots of great lunch areas. One of our new favorite hikes given the doable distance with a gorgeous alpine lake at the end. Parking was a little tight on a Sunday, we got there about 1030 am and found a spot at the day use park/picnic area a few hundred feet from trailhead parking. A little busy for sure on a weekend, just be prepared to pass a lot of people. However didnt have any trouble finding a quiet area up top.

Echo Mountain	Laughsalot0579	Obstacles on trail:	    Trees down across trail.	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	This was a great hike, not too difficult easy for the novice hiker. There were a couple of logs blocking the trail but nothing too crazy that you couldn’t just step over. I will say I was a bit disappointed that the trail to Shady Lake ends in a housing development. The mosquitoes were a bit of a nuisance but overall not too bad. I was super excited to see another hike-athon hiker at this trail. #	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-12.4590518621
Green Mountain	zaranth	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	No bugs	Snow free	Started driving at 4:30am and Arrived at the trail head just before 7am and was moving at 7:06am.  The weather was not great, but when you've had a babysitter lined up for a couple weeks you go anyway! : )  It drizzled rain the entire way up, but I had my rain set-up and stayed warm and fairly dry.  The trail was stunning in all the morning mists!  So many beautiful flowers and delicious berries : )  Reached the Lookout at 9:29am, relaxed, ate some food and headed down at 10am.  No views at the top unfortunately and it was locked-no volunteers staying there this weekend it seems probably because of the thunder storm last night.  The air smelled amazing and I really got to relax in the quiet : ) Not the best hiking pace up there, but oh well-Great trip anyway : ). . . returned to the car at 11:43am and started the long drive home.  I'll be back Green Mountain when there are clear skies! : )	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-12.4358535785
Goat Lake	Hardraka	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Nice and busy day at the lake.. Lot filled.. Lots of campers.. Their is an upper and lower trail.. The lower trail is much prettier with winding paths, bridges, and flowing waters.. The lake continues on to the left side of the lake and we went a quarter of the way around until the shrubs were tough to battle thru. The trail was 10.5 miles rt and is a gently rolling  grade with several easy switchback at the end. The lake drops off to pretty deep, and I was surprised when. I swam to the middle (colder than colchuck last week) how deep the lake is. Great overall day...	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-12.7509167082
Kendall Katwalk	Eva_C	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	It was the first cool day for a while, so there was a lovely light mist on the way up and substantial rain on the way down. But no bugs! A modest trek past the lookout to the Lakes--with breaks--took about 2:45. There wasn't much water at the crossings so not much treachery. I snagged one of the last parking spots in the lot at 9:30 but the trail was peaceful. Recommend this one!	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-12.0995121103
Granite Mountain	BlueberryBarca	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	It was foggy day so we didn’t have expansive views on our morning hike BUT the blueberries and huckleberries more than made up for that! Tons and tons of berries starting around 4200 feet and getting better in taste and quantity as we went higher. There are a few flowers left. It’s a beautiful hike even without seeing Mt. Rainier. I think it will have beautiful fall colors in September.	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-12.4740641309
Otter Falls - Taylor River	karnage	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	We arrived at the trailhead at 9 AM. and left the parking lot promptly. They're were maybe 8 other cars in the lot at that time. It took us a leisurely 6 hours round trip carrying a year and a half year old and a four-year-old. The trail is nice and my old with little elevation and just a short time when you get to the turn off the main Trail. The left turn off of the trail is very well marked with a large cairn and pink tape. From there you just climb up about a quarter of mile and you can see the falls right in front of you. There's currently an angry hornet nest along that portion near a large uprooted tree so just keep your eyes open to avoid it. One of us got stung. Today was a little bit cool so the kids just splashed around and did a little bit of wading, but the adults stayed out of the water. Trail was quiet and not very populated. Berries were ripening along the trail. We munched blueberries, thimbleberries and huckleberries. #hikeathon	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-12.4033133831
Boardman Lake	doonkeen	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	No bugs	Snow free	Farm Road 4020 was rough, with a few larger areas full of water, but manageable. Don't be too intimidated with the first rough patches which is almost the worst of it. Keep going. Once up to the parking area, we missed the trailhead but with the help of another, were able to find it and make our way to Boardman Lake. The trail was in great condition and could be easily navigated by all, though some areas were slick because of recent rain. Boardman Lake was the perfect temperature to enjoy and take in the surrounding scenery. Perfect little hike to kill a few hours.

Snow Lake	ChelseaE06	Obstacles on trail:	    Muddy or wet trail.	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	I’ve never done snow lake and wanted to cross it off my list. We started before 8, knowing this is a very popular hike. Going up there was traffic but not a ton. Bugs were awful,  but appeared to not be mosquitoes. If you stop moving they will swarm you. Hike seemed relatively easy but was about half rocks, which were quite slippery after the recent rain.  Trail was also muddy in places.  Coming down around 10 am there was a TON of traffic coming up, including one man who was not happy that I didn’t move out of his way fast enough. I was attempting to yield, but it was quite rocky and narrow and I was losing my balance. He yelled at me that he had the right of way and then pushed me with his shoulder against the rocks. Not cool. I’m aware of trail etiquette, but sometimes people need a second. In summary,  this hike is fine. I’ve seen prettier alpine lakes, the trail kind of sucked today with the wet rocks and I don’t go out in nature to feel like I’m at Disneyland and be yelled at 😀. 	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-12.1686694203
Mima Mounds	jeo2hiker	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Easy loop trail. There were still a few wildflowers, but much of the foliage seemed to be transitioning to fall. Saw a kestrel hunting and heard meadowlarks. The gun club was active and the most noise was on the nature trail at the beginning of the loop. The model planes were also a distraction. Since this is late in the season for this area, there were few people on the trail. Enjoyable, we will visit again in the spring. The reindeer lichen was interesting - starting to get spongy rather that dried out.	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-12.1029054901
Colchuck Lake	Hmckinley	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	I recommend going early. We got there at 8:10am and the parking lot was already full. What a beautiful hike and amazing lake. Due to the lack of rain the road to the trailhead is really dusty so don’t expect a clean vehicle when you’re done. Bugs were not a problem while we were there. 	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-15.4177544114
Cascade Pass	Nicholas Tilley	Obstacles on trail:	    Overgrown in places.	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were terrible	We did an out and back starting at Cascade Pass and going to Stehekin. Ran into a black bear almost immediately right off trail. He was lazily munching away at berries. Made plenty of noise, but he was on his time and so were we. Up to the pass the trail is in perfect condition with ripe blueberries at the top and heading down into Pelton Basin. Doubtful creek ford was easy peezy, we didn't even get our feet wet and instead rock hopped across. Heading down to Cottonwood camp the trail was pretty overgrown. Made for slow going and made me wish I had long pant legs. On the way back out there were park service employees doing trail brushing and I thanked them profusely. Cottonwood camp must have a mouse den somewhere, they made good work on my hiking poles, gnawing my handles. Thanks for the extra grip, I guess?  The rest of the trail was in good condition once you get past cottonwood camp. Some of it was a bit overgrown but not too much. Smoke from the crescent mountain fire and cougar creek fire got worse and worse as we neared Stehekin. 	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-15.9566637207
Eastside Trail	Bob and Barb	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Today we hiked 2 miles of the Eastside Trail starting from the parking lot for The Grove of the Patriarchs Trail. This is a nice forest hike which travels along and above the Ohanapecosh River. In 6.2 miles and with a very gradual elevation gain the trail reaches Deer Creek Camp passing several waterfalls along the way. Today we only had time to hike 2 miles, but at sometime in the future we would like to start at the Owyhigh Lakes TH on HWY 123 and hike downhill to the TH for the Grove of the Patriarchs. This would require a 2 car shuttle. There were not many wildflowers, but we did see several rattlesnake-plantain, foam flowers, and pine sap in its late stage. We met only 6 other hikers. This is a good trail to hike on a rainy or cloudy day when Mt Rainier is hidden in the clouds. 	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-14.1848442433
Bandera Mountain	PNWGeorge	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	The road up to the TH is in great condition, no pot holes and my Mazda 3 had no hard time getting up there. Arrived at 10:30am and lot was packed so we parked on road with about 20 others. One bathroom available. Trail is clear of any obstacles and really easy to be on. Thank goodness for the clouds otherwise this hike would have been so incredibly hot. The last 1.5miles are literally scaling the mountain through the beautiful field. (See picture) and well worth it but hard! We had our 75 pound Golden Retriever and although he did fine, a lot of potential to have him trip and hurt his paws either sliding on boulders or getting stuck. I wouldn’t bring him again. Only 1-2 streams/ falls for him to dip in. Bring a lot of water especially if sun is out. No views of Rainer but saw the lakes and surrounding peaks. The last 200 yards or so are somewhat hopping to boulders and can be sketchy so be careful if you had kids on their footing. Take your time coming down. Alot of people had poles and one can see why! Awesome hike and will do again!	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-14.8572637984
Tatoosh Lookout	Tired Feet	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Stunner of a hike!  The elevation gain will get your attention, but well worth it.  Went up and stayed sunday night hoping for good viewing of the Perseid meteor showers, they did not disappoint despite the smoky conditions, and we saw quite a few of the 'shooting stars', I wish I was astro photographer, but can't bring myself to carry a tripod.....a chair yes, tripod no.  Had read a lot of trip reports about the bugs and we went up armed to the teeth with 100% Deet as well as picaridin, never pulled it out even once.  We did wear citronella bracelets but I don't think those were the secret answer to the bugs, they simply were not up there for the entire 24 hours we spent.  I would have indicated no bugs, rather than not too bad, but each of us was bitten by exactly one horsefly, it was like they were on vacation but had to make a small showing!  Had clouds and smoke Sunday evening so had no mountain views, I think ordinarily there are 360 degree views with Mt. Rainier, Mt. St. Helen and Mt. Adams but we will have to return for those.  By Monday at sunrise the clouds had cleared but the smoke prevented views of St. Helen and Adams.  Good views of Mt. Rainier though.  Its a dry hike, so carry enough water, there are two small rivulets at about 2 miles into the hike from the northern trailhead but I suspect they will be dry soon.  At the first junction you come to, stay left, the right hand trail leads to a signed abandoned trail.  The next junction is Tatoosh lakes, stay straight ahead, the next junction is unsigned and a bit confusing.  You can go left or right or straight ahead, you want to stay straight ahead which heads down (don't worry, it will go back up:-).  The Tatoosh lookout trail is unmarked but it leads off of trail 161 back and to the left,  and is found just before a small saddle.  The trail up to the lookout is a beautiful ridge walk.  There is probably only room for 3-4 overnighters to be comfortable up there, got lucky and had it to ourselves.  Small site to the left of the lookout site and a couple flattish spots in a bare rocky area to the right of the lookout slightly down hill.  Lots of temptation on the grassy ridge but please don't.  Was also impressed at how clean it was up there for the whole trail, no sign of bad human behavior, lets keep it that way.

Chatter Creek	KRad	Obstacles on trail:	    Overgrown in places.	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Despite the fall like weather in the mountains we made a quick loop in the Chiwaukum Mountains. This loop is fairly popular and for good reason. We started at the Chatter Creek Trailhead and hiked the somewhat brushy, steep at times, and narrow trail to the ridge line. Other than some minor brush the accent was clear of obstacles.  Once over the ridge we headed through the very scenic larch basins to the junction with the Icicle Ridge Trail and headed up past Lake Edna. As per usual it was windy and briefly rained when at Lake Edna. We wandered onward to Ladies Pass in a cold wind under increasing cloud cover. Plenty of water throughout the journey along Icicle Ridge and no snow to speak of on the trail. We camped at Upper Florence Lake. With the colder temps and breeze the bugs where non-existent.  In the morning after a night of occasional rain and waking up in a cloud we decided to make it a loop. The area between Upper Florence and Frosty Pass is spectacular. With clearing clouds we stopped to admire the meadows above Frosty Pass and then began the decent to Icicle Creek on the Frosty - Wildhorse Trail. The upper valley is very brushy but not hard to follow. All trees have been cleared so the only challenge was dealing with the soaking wet brush. Eventually after a very gradual decent we came to the Icicle Creek Trail and changed into dry clothes and socks.  The five or so miles on the Icicle Creek Trail are pleasant and went by fast. The last 3.5 mile road walk wasn't great, especially on a busy Sunday afternoon, but not terrible. All in all a very lovely loop through some great scenery. Other than the brush the trails are in great shape.	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-14.2990039951
Ashland Lakes	gck	Trail in good condition	Road recommended for high clearance only	No bugs	Snow free	The road is pretty bad. Lots of potholes and it's impossible to avoid a number of them. A regular car probably could make it up, but I wouldn't recommend it unless the driver has some experience with these sorts of roads, and you'd probably still bottom out a few times.  The trail condition is in stark contrast to the road condition! It's very well signed, and the boardwalks make it easy to stay out of the mud for most of the hike. However, some parts of the trail still go through rocky and rooty terrain, which are slippery when wet and require a bit of extra attention. Best part: blueberries the whole way! Many of the berries were still not completely ripe, so it should be really great in a week or two.  The campgrounds look like nice places to spend the night and have fire pits and port-o-potties. For those not camping, there are some wooden decks to sit on and enjoy the lakes. There were no mosquitoes this trip, which was a nice surprise.

Basalt Ridge	C P	Obstacles on trail:	    Trees down across trail,	    Overgrown in places.	Road suitable for all vehicles	Thought after yesterdays Enchantments thru-hike I'd take it easy today.  Ended up doing 17 miles!  Also quite a shock going from hundreds of other hikers to none. Rock Creek is a really nice trail.  Lots of streams for drinking and cooling off. Took it out past the Wilderness boundary to about mile 5, where it became quite overgrown.  2 places before that were also brushy, with several down trees (none an issue for hikers). Hiked back to the junction with the Rock Tie and headed up.  20 to 30 trees down along this, mostly brush-free.  At Basalt Ridge trail, went left about another mile to where there would be nice views (smoke), turned around before reaching high point.  Some brush, trees down. I doubt these issues will be addressed this year anymore, so for now hikers will have the trail to themselves (normally open to horses and bikes).   This one goes all the way to Carne Mountain for a possible car shuttle loop at the Phelps T.H..  You'll just have to wait until next year, or at least until the road is open after fire danger decreases.

Whittier Ridge-Lakes Loop	MisterBlister	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	: Reservations are required for overnight camping along trails in this area, the Mount Margaret Backcountry. Camping is only allowed in designated campsites and you must obtain a permit ahead of time for a site at your destination. Permits through recreation.gov (search: Mount Margaret). This info should be included in trail descriptions under the permits section. https://www.recreation.gov/wildernessAreaDetails.do?contractCode=NRSO&parkId=111240 We hiked from the Norway Pass TH to Obscurity Lake via Bear Pass, camped at Obscurity Camp and did a short side trip on to Panhandle Lake. It's worth noting that Obscurity Camp is a little distance beyond the lake itself and does not have lake views. Somebody (assuming WTA?) has very recently done nice work clearing brush and widening the trail between Grizzly Lake and Obscurity Lake. Thanks! Except for a few mosquitoes around sunset bug activity was light. I never broke out the bug juice. There are some nice late-season flowers still going - paintbrush, asters, etc. But a great reason to go right now is...HUCKLEBERRRIES! I have never seen such a bumper crop of berries. There are long stretches of the trail where you don't have to stop to pick, you just keep continuously grabbing berries as you hike along. Even the campsite itself was full of loaded bushes. My hands are still blue.	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-14.0070393720
Cougar Divide	MadMapper	Obstacles on trail:	    Trees down across trail,	    Overgrown in places,	    Mud/Rock slide or washout.	Posting this to save others some possible grief. I strongly recommend NOT attempting this hike at present. I went with my hardiest hiking companion and not only did we have to cut the trip short, we were both grumpy afterward. Challenges: 1) The road is washed out worse than ever. Consequently it’s still gated at the bottom so you’ll have to walk or bike the 12+ miles and 3700 feet of vertical to even see the trailhead. If you choose to ride, keep in mind carrying your backpack gear while riding a bike is much harder than just riding a bike. And getting past the washouts will involve dangerous, exposed and soaking events, all made more challenging if you’re dragging a loaded bike. 2) The bugs are formidable. Being long time Cascade hikers we aren’t bug squeamish but at higher elevations here the mosquitoes get to apocalyptic densities. Even wearing head nets we struggled to remain calm. Lots of mosquitoes crawled up under my net and I managed to inhale several, resulting in wracking spasms of coughing. Toss in some horseflies for the occasional nasty zinger and you’ve got the general idea. 3) The trail hasn’t been maintained for a long time (no surprise) and is difficult to follow in places. It also requires scrambling under, over and around multiple large deadfalls. 4) The smoke (mid-August 2018) is dreary and obscures views of Baker and other nearby peaks. According to a MBSNF ranger the road repair work that was slated to happen this summer hasn’t made it onto the schedule yet. Honestly, the biggest washout looks like something that would require very substantial time, equipment and money to repair. Or perhaps a complete rerouting of the road. And the higher part of the road, beyond Bar Creek, is no longer publicly maintained so the multiple slides, washouts and overgrown sections would have to be repaired and maintained with private funds. It’s hard to see how that happens. Maybe this is an area that could be left to revert to wilderness with trails instead of roads. Wells Creek / Bar Creek is a beautiful glacier fed valley that might someday make a fine long hiking route to the north side of Baker.

Boulder River	Kronst	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	:  4 of 5 stars (up to the second waterfall – lower rating after the waterfalls)   :  This is a nice hike.  The first double waterfall is beautiful.  It’s worth climbing down to it to explore and get pictures.  The second waterfall is okay.  Also, I’d advise people to turn around after the second waterfall (at about 1.5 miles) because the scenery does not change very much—you’re walking through beautiful old growth forest—unless you want to have an aerobics walk without much of an elevation gain.  Overall, the hike is an easy hike, which you can take kids on (but watch them, sometimes there is a long drop off the side of the trail).   : Horrible pot holes.  I guess one can get there with a sedan, but I’m so glad I had an SUV (Toyota Highlander).  I got there about 2 pm on a Sunday afternoon and there was parking.   :  None.   :  None.   :  Great.   Almost to the first waterfall, on the old roadbed, one could take a stroller, this part of the trail is very well maintained—flat without many roots and rocks.  Although past the first waterfall, there are places that are muddy, rocky, rooty.  Not bad though.   :  Not bad!  I used Neem bug spray.   : This trail took me (a 60-year-old guy) about 6 hours, with about a half hour exploring near the first waterfall.  I also went all the way to the end of the campsites.     :  Very nice waterfall views.      :  Minimal.

Talapus and Olallie Lakes	geezopeezos	Minor obstacles posing few problems	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	This was my first backpacking trip, so I chose the not so far away Olallie Lake as a base camp. I arrived at the trailhead Sunday morning at 0800. The parking lot was already half full with overnighters. I noted that 'bugs were not too bad' but I definitely wore bug spray and had long pants on. There were mosquitos, but no black flies. It was better than a hike here last weekend. BE AWARE Vehicle break-ins occurred at the Talapus Lake Trailhead on 8/11. Do not leave any valuables in your vehicle. BE AWARE I arrived to Olallie Lake around 1030 and found an established campsite on the north end. It was the first one on the right after the second vault toilet. Around 1130 I chose to head out for a day hike to Rainbow and Island Lakes. The hike to Rainbow Lake was not super strenuous, but the jaunt up and down to get there was a bit surprising, and tired me out. There are great views along the entire trail. Beautiful flowers and plentiful huckleberries to snack on as you go. Rainbow Lake was enjoyable, except for one noisy group  of at least three people who were camping or resting nearby. I rested for 20 mins on a rather large and comfortable rock, and then decided to head to Island Lake. On the way to Island Lake there is a vault toilet spur with a SPECTACULAR view. Don't miss out! I would guess that it is Talapus Lake below. One other person showed up 30 sec after I arrived, but that was the only other person I saw while I spent 20-30 mins exploring around the lake. I found an established campsite, where a dead tree had fallen right on the level area where a tent would go! This cautions you to ALWAYS be aware of the hazards when choosing a camp site. I took my photos, filtered some water from the creek flowing off the lake, and then headed back to Olallie Lake for the night. It was a great experience, but for my first trip it was difficult to find a way to sleep comfortably. #hike-a-thon	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-13.6730778894

No mud very little water other than creeks of course. Hike in from Scenic to the upper grade and at the martin creek connector hiked the lower grade back to Scenic. Lower grade was much busier that the upper grade but not to many people, most of the day we were alone on the trail.

Eightmile Lake	steffunny	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	We opted for Eightmile Lake after reading about how crowded it is on the weekend at Colchuck. Eightmile Lake is a nice alternative in the same area! We arrived just before 11am on a Sunday and easily found parking at the trailhead. There were only a few other groups on the trail, and a few campers at the lake. Even though the sky was rather hazy from the nearby wildfires, it was still a really nice hike, and very peaceful at the lake. You are never far from the sounds and sights of Eightmile Creek gushing past. We saw lots of wildlife - squirrels, chipmunks, pikas, grouse, and a deer. Many birds at the lake - violet-green swallows, hummingbirds, junkos, and either kinglet or warblers. Plenty of wildflowers too! Trail is in good condition - a mix of dusty, dry paths but also some wet and muddy patches. We applied bug spray before we started the hike, but there really didn't seem to be many bugs around! 	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-13.9379433880
Tumac Mountain Loop (Trails 980, 44, 2000, 980)	HBell	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Went on a pleasant loop hike yesterday with the dogs. This loop (trails 980, 44, 2000, and 980) has a good day hike distance (~12 or 13 miles) and nice climb (2000 feet) up to a 360-degree view at Tumac Mountain.  Then it's all easy downhill coasting the rest of the way. As far as wildflowers, I noticed only a few patches of lupine. Trail 44 is pretty severely rutted in many stretches, but no blockages. The stretch of PCT (Trail 2000) is especially serene and in good condition. I couldn't help but notice some suds on the shore of the eastern of the Twin Sisters Lakes. Campers please don't dump soap into wilderness lakes. The road to the trailhead is pretty rocky and it's probably best to use a high-clearance vehicle; however, I got lucky and had no mishaps with my Mercedes sedan.

Fragrance Lake	carol	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Fairly easy, in-the-shade hike on well-used, well-maintained trail; just right for my partner's bit of arthritis. Reforested with lots of space, light, breezes and ferns. Parking was full at the trailhead when we arrived at 11 am on a Sunday, but you can park across the road at the State Park where they have clean bathrooms with flush toilets. Hikers were well-spread-out and friendly; there were several places around this small but lovely lake to stop for lunch or a brisk swim.

Mount Daniel	Cairn	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were an annoyance	Intermittent snow - not hard to cross	Looks like there are several recent trip reports offering excellent information about the SE ridge route. Just a couple things that may be helpful: . The two easiest methods (we used both) are: 1. A steep bootpath up through the trees. You access this path by taking a left (west) off the main trail that leads from the north end of Peggy's pond over to the toilet near(ish) Hyas Creek. I only saw one toilet, not two, although there were many signs leading to it. 2. Clambering up the rocky ramp between two large rock outcroppings. See photo above (NOTE: I'm NOT referring to the rocky basin with large cairns marking it. I'm guessing these cairns mark the route via Hyas Glacier?) If you take this route, you'l l go up the rocks and then veer left to scramble to the top of a little ridge with trees. At this point, you will be at the top of the boot path that is described in #1. We took this way up in the morning b/c the bootpath would have left us soaking wet (water on trees/undergrowth). '. On the way up to the West Summit, we opted for staying on the rocky ridge, which was fine--a couple Class 3 (maybe?) moves with some exposure that got my heart racing b/c I felt like the rock was loose and crumbly in some places. (Oh, OK, and because I can be a weeny sometimes.) On the way down, we DID cross the snow, which I'd guess was 25-30 degrees at the most. See photo below. It was a great choice for us. We had helmets, ice axes and crampons (which made us a lot heavier, ugh.)  So, know your preferences/comfort level and choose accordingly.

Fragrance Lake	Jeff Bottman	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Some useful beta ... we hiked the "two dollar trail", which has less elevation gain / distance than the standard trail as described in the WTA hiking guide.  550 feet / 3.4 miles round trip.  Very nice, smooth trail, with some nice views to the San Juan Islands and sound.  Small, cute lake, with an encircling trail.  Looks like a good swimming spot on a warm day.  Zero bugs!  A great mellow, low effort hike, just enough elevation to qualify as a spot of exercise. 	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-12.1333969992
Sauk Lake	Muledeer	Minor obstacles posing few problems	Road rough but passable	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	I've been to Sauk Mtn many times, but never hiked down to the lake. Well curiosity got the best of me and Ravennspirit and I  finally hiked down to the lake. The trail forks off of the Sauk Mtn trail right after crossing over the ridge. Sadly, the sign pointing to the lake trail was missing, not just down, but completely missing! You can't miss the trail tho, it is the one going steeply downhill. It is actually pretty good trail, as steep trails go. No root ladders or large rocks, but some loose rocky scree. The trail takes you down thru some lush wildflower meadows, before entering a wooded area with fir and mtn hemlock. At one point there is a spur trail to the right, I believe it may be the old Sauk Mtn trail coming from hwy 20. I did not see any of C P s flagging tho, so not sure. Anyway stay on the main trail to the left.  Once thru the woods, enter a meadow filled with fireweed and false hellebore (also called corn lily). There is the lake, but you still have a ways to go. The trail keeps switchbacking down, skirting around the lake above a small boulder field. Up just a little, then the trail drops you down to the far side of the lake close to the outlet stream. Unfortunately, there are some campsites by the lake made by hikers that don't abide by the LNT principles. There are also some campsites on a bluff overlooking the lake, some of those have been well taken care of. Wisps of clouds kept playing peek a boo with Sauk Mtn, but we did get some views from the lake of the mountain top we'd been on before. The lake itself is a beautiful little lake with lots of flowers blooming along it's shores. There was still just a bit of snow on the opposite side of the lake. This is a bear hunting area, but we didn't see any bears or hunters. We did, however see lots of marmots! They were still in family groups, you could see the young ones playing and foraging while the larger adults sat on rocks as lookouts. We also watched an osprey hunt above the lake, catching fish. If you do this hike remember, all the downhill must be regained on the way out, all 1300'   Hikeathon: Help me support our trails by donating to my hikeathon fundraising page.  give.wta.org/Muledeer 	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-12.9407652267

Iron Goat Trail	R2T2	Obstacles on trail:	    Overgrown in places.	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	 Started from the trailhead off of Hwy. 2 (the one with the big caboose) about 9am. Only two other cars in the lot.   Headed up the switchbacks... about 600ft in just under 3/4 mile gets your blood pumping, but won't wear you out.   Once up to the main Iron Goat Trail, it's all railroad grade for the 3 miles to the old Wellington town site. Pretty quickly after starting up the trail, the Windy Point viewpoint appears. Nice view here to Hwy. 2, as well as the newer (still in use) railroad tunnel. It was still cloudy, so the surrounding mountains were in hiding. Back on the trail from the viewpoint, you'll turn a corner and find an old, abandoned tunnel. You can enter the first few feet of the tunnel, up to where it's fenced off. As with most of the trail, there are interpretive signs here describing the history of the railroad and the area.   After the this tunnel, the trail becomes quite overgrown. It's never so thick that you can't find the trail, but if you go, as we did, just after a rain shower, you're going to get very wet. There is a nice break from the overgrowth as you travel through a quiet forested area. Bugs are not too bad, but the few that were around liked to bite.  After leaving the forested area, you're back in the narrow, overgrown trail until you reach the super-cool, 1/2 mile-long concrete snowshed. Again, there are interpretive signs here, describing the story of the 1910 avalanche which killed 96 people.   After the snowshed, you'll reach Wellington. Just a few remnants of Wellington remain as you pass through the former townsite. But keep going a short distance to find the west portal to the first Cascade Tunnel. More signs here with information about the tunnel, as well as warnings to avoid entering.   Then it's back the way you came, being especially careful when heading down the switchbacks, as they're quite steep and rocky.   All in, we totaled just under 9 miles and around 900ft. gained. GPS did not like the tunnels, and especially did not like the concrete snowshed... made the track on our apps go a little wonky.   --also, if you have the need, there's an outdoor (no walls) vault toilet near the Windy Point viewpoint. Interesting place to 'go'--	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-12.7823438052
Kendall Katwalk	mayamandyam	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Great hike today! It wasn’t that steep, and the Katwalk was totally worth it. We were in the clouds almost the whole time, so there wasn’t really a view, but it mostly kept the bugs away.	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-12.1028530443
Spray Park	emeraldyellow	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Intermittent snow - not hard to cross	Did the hike up to Spray Park. Continued onward to visit the beginning area of Observation and Echo. All in all a 10.66 round trip hike by way of the All Trails app recording. Unsure of the elevation. We decided not to try to get up and around either Observation or (more desirably) Echo due to the snow fields and our lack of crampons. All in all just an amazing playground out there. By afternoon, the clouds had settled and visibility was almost impossible, so we were glad to be back to the car. It was nice stopping at the falls on the way back, too.

Paradise Valley Conservation Area	ninjaracerchick	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	I’ve been mtn biking here many times, but since it’s hike-a-thon I hiked it for the first time. There are so many trails here that you can go many times and never have the same experience. Combined a few of the hiking only trails I had never been on and a few of the smaller hike/bike trails. A little over 3mi in a pretty forested area. Make sure to snap a shot of the map if you’ve never been, though the markers are pretty informative on which way to go. always leave your car empty, I’ve seen glass on the ground a few times.

Heybrook Ridge	wafflesnfalafel	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Walked the new-ish Heybrook Ridge trail on a still a bit drippy Sunday morning.  Just a single car in the nice, big gravel lot at 7:30 AM.  Sani-can in the lot is currently functional.  The trail is in great shape and very nicely built - sturdy and functional but not overdone.  Trail distance is exactly as advertised with mileage marked along the way and a nice bench about halfway up to take a load off for a bit.  There is some road noise from Hwy 2 along the first bit but once away from the road all you can hear is the river and the breeze in the trees and an occasional train rounding the tight horseshoe curve at Index.  Forest is mostly scrubby second gen dog hair hemlock and cedar.   There are a few peak-a-boo views of the Index wall cliffs but the good views don't start until the very end of the trail.  Super nice views east up the valley and south across to Bridal Veil falls, (the ongoing logging that has the Bridal Veil falls and Lake Serene trails closed currently is very evident just west.)  The powerlines kinda mess up views west.  However, the powerline path does offer the interesting possibility of following them east all the way to the Heybrook Lookout a little over a mile east.  Don't miss the two block walk from the parking lot over the bridge into Index for some more views, (and maybe a snack at the general store if it's open.)   	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-12.1238609064
Wallace Falls State Park	Mack Hall	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Over all a great hike!  We arrived at 9AM to a half full parking lot. The first stretch of the hike under the power lines was filled with blackberries. Grabbed a few with the kids and a few for the dog and entered the woods.  We took the Upper Wood trail in which is longer that the lower river trail but is very easy. Not many people on the upper trail. We dropped down at the Railroad cutoff trail about 2.5 miles in. From there it was about .5 miles to the Lower Falls overlook. Lot of people on the trail. Falls were beautiful! The way back had a lot of people but was otherwise pretty with lots of views of the river. Parking lot and road was full on the way out at noon.

Cherry Creek Falls	tanalan	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Went on this Aug 12, Sunday morning, starting around 9 am. Took about an hour to get to the Falls. This was a super chill trail -- quite straightforward walking trails and nothing too intensive. There was a broken down car, which looks to seem more like a piece of art at this point, given how long it's been there, which is interesting. Not much to say other than that! It's a nice trail :]	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-13.5984847928
Mailbox Peak	seattlehiker18	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	This is the second time my friend and I have hiked Mailbox. We are weekend hikers who enjoy a lot of elevation gain. The hike yesterday was very pleasant given the hot weather recently. We arrived around 11 AM and found a spot in the main parking lot. The trail was not busy and we only saw a few people and dogs. There was a lot of fog at the top and virtually no view of Mt. Rainier--which was okay given the cooler temperatures. There were very few people at the top, most likely due to the "bad" weather. It took us about 2 hours to get to the top and the parking lot had emptied by the time we got down, around 4 PM. It was great the second time around! 	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-13.6262192983
Minotaur Lake	Blpnwadventurer	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were terrible	Snow free	Like everyone says, the mosquitos were awful! I reapplied repellent a few times and I still got bit. Definitely a lot of bugs once you reach the lake as well. This hike was definitely one of the hardest hikes I've ever done. Just because it's only a few miles, the elevation makes up for it. My legs were wobbling on the way back down. Hiking poles are recommended. The view though, definitely worth it. It was beautiful.  Nothing compared to seeing it with your own eyes. 	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-13.1122368059
Tolmie Peak Lookout - Eunice Lake	klare	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	No bugs	Snow free	Wow! What a beautiful trail! I left around 5:45am out of Seattle and got to the trailhead around 7:45. No really large potholes in the road, but it was super long and annoying. My little hatchback was going ~20mph on it and was fine though I did see an group changing a flat on an suv. Just know that those vehicles aren't immune to how rocky that road can be, so go slow. I did see the ranger leaving right when I was pulling into the lot, so please be aware that they do check for passes! I didn't see anyone on the trail after I started until I got to Eunice lake. It was really peaceful and empty, quite foggy until I started the climb to the lookout when the clouds started burning off Rainier. It was one of the best hiking experiences I've had to see Rainier revealed like that in the early morning! There were about 10 people up at and around the lookout when I got up there, and plenty more I passed on my way down. Probably took 1 1/4 hours for me to get up, even with picture breaks. I was back in Seattle by 1pm.	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-13.8925835076
Silver Peak	svanandw	Trail in good condition	Road recommended for high clearance only	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Great hike! The road to get there is tough on the car. SUVs are best adept to handle the road conditions but I would have been concerned taking my sedan. The trail head could have been better marked. If you are coming up the road, it’s on your left. The hike gets a bit challenging in the end with a steep incline filled with rocks. The view from the top is great albeit we had fog that limited views.

Mirror and Cottonwood Lakes	SMSweitz	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Parking is the only mild challenge for this easy, lovely trail through bursting huckleberry and wild blueberry bushes and 90 year old trees. Clearly a family friendly trail with lots of kids on foot and in carriers on the trail.  Mirror Lake area was chilly enough for down jackets today, but the water was warm enough to soak in for hours. 	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-13.7590506450
Lake 22	Wanderlustering WA with Dogs	Obstacles on trail:	    Trees down across trail,	    Muddy or wet trail.	Road suitable for all vehicles	I was needing a short and simple hike as it was supposed to be a cloudy day so I got a late start and canceled a longer trip I had planned to go on. I had not been to Lake 22 in a very long time so decided to give it a go as it is not a very strenuous trail. Arrived in the parking lot just past 3:00 pm, the lot was packed. Bad timing on my part because the trail was very crowded with hoards of people descending from the lake, not many people going up at this time. Would have been better to hike either a couple hours earlier or later. As others have said, a lot of people were not knowledgeable of proper trail etiquette and were not yielding the right-of-way to uphill hikers. Not cool. Many, many dogs on the trail today, all but one were on leash and all but one were friendly and non-aggressive. A couple other hikers made some unfriendly comments about why everyone feels they have the right to bring their dogs on trails but most hikers were very positive. No left behind pet waste and people were prepared with poo bags so that was nice to see. The trail itself is very rocky, rooty and wet almost from start to finish. Had to do a paw check once I got back to the car; my pup's paw pads were tender but not cut. This is not the most comfortable trail to hike on but once you get to the lake, the sore feet (and paws) seem worth it! Started my hike at 3:15, arrived at the lake at 5:00 on the dot (should have taken less time but as aforementioned, many hikers heading down as we were heading up). Spent ten minutes snapping photos (I decided not to walk around the lake) and then headed back down. Was back to the car around 6:20. All in all, a short and easy hike. The lake was serene and beautiful and the chill mountain air was super refreshing!	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-12.1877774866
Lake Valhalla	Greenlake Power Walker	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	It took about 2 hrs driving from Seattle. Got to the TH around 10am, almost missed the “exit” coming from Hwy2 EB (via Smithbrook trail). That left turn sneaks up on y’all of you’re not paying attention. Parking lot was full but we parked along the side; there were plenty of spots. Hiked with two young kids (like we do most Sundays; read my other reviews), it took about two hrs. This was such an easy simple hike. This was perfect for my kids after the “harder, steeper” trails we’ve been on lately. The lake was gorgeous, we went down to the sandy beach area and they played and played for about an hr. As more people arrived we decided to head back. It took us about two hrs to get back to the car; they kids were DONE hiking midway back (LOL).  On our way down we saw a lot of groups heading up, I hope they got back before sundown. When we got to the parking lot around 3pm, there were about 40 cars.  This trail is def a hidden gem. Get there early, the FS rd. was the best road I’ve driven on. No dusk kick up from the car, easy trail (not steep at all AND it intersects the PCT!), beautiful lake, plenty of camping spots, but no bathroom- there is one once you get to the lake tho. Will be back to do an overnight! 	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-12.8034004154
Lake 22	akabanana	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Beautiful! Hiked with husband and dog today, trail was a little rocky at times but definitely doable, even though this was pup’s first real hike. The lake at the end is wonderful, and warm enough to swim in. The trail is well maintained and goes completely around the lake, includes wildflowers and lots of great lunch areas. One of our new favorite hikes given the doable distance with a gorgeous alpine lake at the end. Parking was a little tight on a Sunday, we got there about 1030 am and found a spot at the day use park/picnic area a few hundred feet from trailhead parking. A little busy for sure on a weekend, just be prepared to pass a lot of people. However didnt have any trouble finding a quiet area up top.

Echo Mountain	Laughsalot0579	Obstacles on trail:	    Trees down across trail.	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	This was a great hike, not too difficult easy for the novice hiker. There were a couple of logs blocking the trail but nothing too crazy that you couldn’t just step over. I will say I was a bit disappointed that the trail to Shady Lake ends in a housing development. The mosquitoes were a bit of a nuisance but overall not too bad. I was super excited to see another hike-athon hiker at this trail. #	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-12.4590518621
Green Mountain	zaranth	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	No bugs	Snow free	Started driving at 4:30am and Arrived at the trail head just before 7am and was moving at 7:06am.  The weather was not great, but when you've had a babysitter lined up for a couple weeks you go anyway! : )  It drizzled rain the entire way up, but I had my rain set-up and stayed warm and fairly dry.  The trail was stunning in all the morning mists!  So many beautiful flowers and delicious berries : )  Reached the Lookout at 9:29am, relaxed, ate some food and headed down at 10am.  No views at the top unfortunately and it was locked-no volunteers staying there this weekend it seems probably because of the thunder storm last night.  The air smelled amazing and I really got to relax in the quiet : ) Not the best hiking pace up there, but oh well-Great trip anyway : ). . . returned to the car at 11:43am and started the long drive home.  I'll be back Green Mountain when there are clear skies! : )	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-12.4358535785
Goat Lake	Hardraka	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Nice and busy day at the lake.. Lot filled.. Lots of campers.. Their is an upper and lower trail.. The lower trail is much prettier with winding paths, bridges, and flowing waters.. The lake continues on to the left side of the lake and we went a quarter of the way around until the shrubs were tough to battle thru. The trail was 10.5 miles rt and is a gently rolling  grade with several easy switchback at the end. The lake drops off to pretty deep, and I was surprised when. I swam to the middle (colder than colchuck last week) how deep the lake is. Great overall day...	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-12.7509167082
Kendall Katwalk	Eva_C	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	It was the first cool day for a while, so there was a lovely light mist on the way up and substantial rain on the way down. But no bugs! A modest trek past the lookout to the Lakes--with breaks--took about 2:45. There wasn't much water at the crossings so not much treachery. I snagged one of the last parking spots in the lot at 9:30 but the trail was peaceful. Recommend this one!	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-12.0995121103
Granite Mountain	BlueberryBarca	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	It was foggy day so we didn’t have expansive views on our morning hike BUT the blueberries and huckleberries more than made up for that! Tons and tons of berries starting around 4200 feet and getting better in taste and quantity as we went higher. There are a few flowers left. It’s a beautiful hike even without seeing Mt. Rainier. I think it will have beautiful fall colors in September.	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-12.4740641309
Otter Falls - Taylor River	karnage	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	We arrived at the trailhead at 9 AM. and left the parking lot promptly. They're were maybe 8 other cars in the lot at that time. It took us a leisurely 6 hours round trip carrying a year and a half year old and a four-year-old. The trail is nice and my old with little elevation and just a short time when you get to the turn off the main Trail. The left turn off of the trail is very well marked with a large cairn and pink tape. From there you just climb up about a quarter of mile and you can see the falls right in front of you. There's currently an angry hornet nest along that portion near a large uprooted tree so just keep your eyes open to avoid it. One of us got stung. Today was a little bit cool so the kids just splashed around and did a little bit of wading, but the adults stayed out of the water. Trail was quiet and not very populated. Berries were ripening along the trail. We munched blueberries, thimbleberries and huckleberries. #hikeathon	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-12.4033133831
Boardman Lake	doonkeen	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	No bugs	Snow free	Farm Road 4020 was rough, with a few larger areas full of water, but manageable. Don't be too intimidated with the first rough patches which is almost the worst of it. Keep going. Once up to the parking area, we missed the trailhead but with the help of another, were able to find it and make our way to Boardman Lake. The trail was in great condition and could be easily navigated by all, though some areas were slick because of recent rain. Boardman Lake was the perfect temperature to enjoy and take in the surrounding scenery. Perfect little hike to kill a few hours.

Snow Lake	ChelseaE06	Obstacles on trail:	    Muddy or wet trail.	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	I’ve never done snow lake and wanted to cross it off my list. We started before 8, knowing this is a very popular hike. Going up there was traffic but not a ton. Bugs were awful,  but appeared to not be mosquitoes. If you stop moving they will swarm you. Hike seemed relatively easy but was about half rocks, which were quite slippery after the recent rain.  Trail was also muddy in places.  Coming down around 10 am there was a TON of traffic coming up, including one man who was not happy that I didn’t move out of his way fast enough. I was attempting to yield, but it was quite rocky and narrow and I was losing my balance. He yelled at me that he had the right of way and then pushed me with his shoulder against the rocks. Not cool. I’m aware of trail etiquette, but sometimes people need a second. In summary,  this hike is fine. I’ve seen prettier alpine lakes, the trail kind of sucked today with the wet rocks and I don’t go out in nature to feel like I’m at Disneyland and be yelled at 😀. 	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-12.1686694203
Mima Mounds	jeo2hiker	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Easy loop trail. There were still a few wildflowers, but much of the foliage seemed to be transitioning to fall. Saw a kestrel hunting and heard meadowlarks. The gun club was active and the most noise was on the nature trail at the beginning of the loop. The model planes were also a distraction. Since this is late in the season for this area, there were few people on the trail. Enjoyable, we will visit again in the spring. The reindeer lichen was interesting - starting to get spongy rather that dried out.	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-12.1029054901
Colchuck Lake	Hmckinley	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	I recommend going early. We got there at 8:10am and the parking lot was already full.

Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were terrible	We did an out and back starting at Cascade Pass and going to Stehekin. Ran into a black bear almost immediately right off trail. He was lazily munching away at berries. Made plenty of noise, but he was on his time and so were we. Up to the pass the trail is in perfect condition with ripe blueberries at the top and heading down into Pelton Basin. Doubtful creek ford was easy peezy, we didn't even get our feet wet and instead rock hopped across. Heading down to Cottonwood camp the trail was pretty overgrown. Made for slow going and made me wish I had long pant legs. On the way back out there were park service employees doing trail brushing and I thanked them profusely. Cottonwood camp must have a mouse den somewhere, they made good work on my hiking poles, gnawing my handles. Thanks for the extra grip, I guess?  The rest of the trail was in good condition once you get past cottonwood camp. Some of it was a bit overgrown but not too much. Smoke from the crescent mountain fire and cougar creek fire got worse and worse as we neared Stehekin. 	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-15.9566637207
Eastside Trail	Bob and Barb	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Today we hiked 2 miles of the Eastside Trail starting from the parking lot for The Grove of the Patriarchs Trail. This is a nice forest hike which travels along and above the Ohanapecosh River. In 6.2 miles and with a very gradual elevation gain the trail reaches Deer Creek Camp passing several waterfalls along the way. Today we only had time to hike 2 miles, but at sometime in the future we would like to start at the Owyhigh Lakes TH on HWY 123 and hike downhill to the TH for the Grove of the Patriarchs. This would require a 2 car shuttle. There were not many wildflowers, but we did see several rattlesnake-plantain, foam flowers, and pine sap in its late stage. We met only 6 other hikers. This is a good trail to hike on a rainy or cloudy day when Mt Rainier is hidden in the clouds. 	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-14.1848442433
Bandera Mountain	PNWGeorge	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	The road up to the TH is in great condition, no pot holes and my Mazda 3 had no hard time getting up there. Arrived at 10:30am and lot was packed so we parked on road with about 20 others. One bathroom available. Trail is clear of any obstacles and really easy to be on. Thank goodness for the clouds otherwise this hike would have been so incredibly hot. The last 1.5miles are literally scaling the mountain through the beautiful field. (See picture) and well worth it but hard! We had our 75 pound Golden Retriever and although he did fine, a lot of potential to have him trip and hurt his paws either sliding on boulders or getting stuck. I wouldn’t bring him again. Only 1-2 streams/ falls for him to dip in. Bring a lot of water especially if sun is out. No views of Rainer but saw the lakes and surrounding peaks. The last 200 yards or so are somewhat hopping to boulders and can be sketchy so be careful if you had kids on their footing. Take your time coming down. Alot of people had poles and one can see why! Awesome hike and will do again!	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-14.8572637984
Tatoosh Lookout	Tired Feet	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Stunner of a hike!  The elevation gain will get your attention, but well worth it.  Went up and stayed sunday night hoping for good viewing of the Perseid meteor showers, they did not disappoint despite the smoky conditions, and we saw quite a few of the 'shooting stars', I wish I was astro photographer, but can't bring myself to carry a tripod.....a chair yes, tripod no.  Had read a lot of trip reports about the bugs and we went up armed to the teeth with 100% Deet as well as picaridin, never pulled it out even once.  We did wear citronella bracelets but I don't think those were the secret answer to the bugs, they simply were not up there for the entire 24 hours we spent.  I would have indicated no bugs, rather than not too bad, but each of us was bitten by exactly one horsefly, it was like they were on vacation but had to make a small showing!  Had clouds and smoke Sunday evening so had no mountain views, I think ordinarily there are 360 degree views with Mt. Rainier, Mt. St. Helen and Mt. Adams but we will have to return for those.  By Monday at sunrise the clouds had cleared but the smoke prevented views of St. Helen and Adams.  Good views of Mt. Rainier though.  Its a dry hike, so carry enough water, there are two small rivulets at about 2 miles into the hike from the northern trailhead but I suspect they will be dry soon.  At the first junction you come to, stay left, the right hand trail leads to a signed abandoned trail.  The next junction is Tatoosh lakes, stay straight ahead, the next junction is unsigned and a bit confusing.  You can go left or right or straight ahead, you want to stay straight ahead which heads down (don't worry, it will go back up:-).  The Tatoosh lookout trail is unmarked but it leads off of trail 161 back and to the left,  and is found just before a small saddle.  The trail up to the lookout is a beautiful ridge walk.  There is probably only room for 3-4 overnighters to be comfortable up there, got lucky and had it to ourselves.  Small site to the left of the lookout site and a couple flattish spots in a bare rocky area to the right of the lookout slightly down hill.  Lots of temptation on the grassy ridge but please don't.  Was also impressed at how clean it was up there for the whole trail, no sign of bad human behavior, lets keep it that way.

Chatter Creek	KRad	Obstacles on trail:	    Overgrown in places.	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Despite the fall like weather in the mountains we made a quick loop in the Chiwaukum Mountains. This loop is fairly popular and for good reason. We started at the Chatter Creek Trailhead and hiked the somewhat brushy, steep at times, and narrow trail to the ridge line. Other than some minor brush the accent was clear of obstacles.  Once over the ridge we headed through the very scenic larch basins to the junction with the Icicle Ridge Trail and headed up past Lake Edna. As per usual it was windy and briefly rained when at Lake Edna. We wandered onward to Ladies Pass in a cold wind under increasing cloud cover. Plenty of water throughout the journey along Icicle Ridge and no snow to speak of on the trail. We camped at Upper Florence Lake. With the colder temps and breeze the bugs where non-existent.  In the morning after a night of occasional rain and waking up in a cloud we decided to make it a loop. The area between Upper Florence and Frosty Pass is spectacular. With clearing clouds we stopped to admire the meadows above Frosty Pass and then began the decent to Icicle Creek on the Frosty - Wildhorse Trail. The upper valley is very brushy but not hard to follow. All trees have been cleared so the only challenge was dealing with the soaking wet brush. Eventually after a very gradual decent we came to the Icicle Creek Trail and changed into dry clothes and socks.  The five or so miles on the Icicle Creek Trail are pleasant and went by fast. The last 3.5 mile road walk wasn't great, especially on a busy Sunday afternoon, but not terrible. All in all a very lovely loop through some great scenery. Other than the brush the trails are in great shape.	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-14.2990039951
Ashland Lakes	gck	Trail in good condition	Road recommended for high clearance only	No bugs	Snow free	The road is pretty bad. Lots of potholes and it's impossible to avoid a number of them. A regular car probably could make it up, but I wouldn't recommend it unless the driver has some experience with these sorts of roads, and you'd probably still bottom out a few times.  The trail condition is in stark contrast to the road condition! It's very well signed, and the boardwalks make it easy to stay out of the mud for most of the hike. However, some parts of the trail still go through rocky and rooty terrain, which are slippery when wet and require a bit of extra attention. Best part: blueberries the whole way! Many of the berries were still not completely ripe, so it should be really great in a week or two.  The campgrounds look like nice places to spend the night and have fire pits and port-o-potties. For those not camping, there are some wooden decks to sit on and enjoy the lakes. There were no mosquitoes this trip, which was a nice surprise.

Little Giant Pass	Sean Sullivan	Obstacles on trail:	    Trees down across trail,	    Bridge out.	Road impassable/closed	Please note this entire area is currently under closure due to the Lost Fire.	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-14.0709754158
Basalt Ridge	C P	Obstacles on trail:	    Trees down across trail,	    Overgrown in places.	Road suitable for all vehicles	Thought after yesterdays Enchantments thru-hike I'd take it easy today.  Ended up doing 17 miles!  Also quite a shock going from hundreds of other hikers to none. Rock Creek is a really nice trail.  Lots of streams for drinking and cooling off. Took it out past the Wilderness boundary to about mile 5, where it became quite overgrown.  2 places before that were also brushy, with several down trees (none an issue for hikers). Hiked back to the junction with the Rock Tie and headed up.  20 to 30 trees down along this, mostly brush-free.  At Basalt Ridge trail, went left about another mile to where there would be nice views (smoke), turned around before reaching high point.  Some brush, trees down. I doubt these issues will be addressed this year anymore, so for now hikers will have the trail to themselves (normally open to horses and bikes).   This one goes all the way to Carne Mountain for a possible car shuttle loop at the Phelps T.H..  You'll just have to wait until next year, or at least until the road is open after fire danger decreases.

Whittier Ridge-Lakes Loop	MisterBlister	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	: Reservations are required for overnight camping along trails in this area, the Mount Margaret Backcountry. Camping is only allowed in designated campsites and you must obtain a permit ahead of time for a site at your destination. Permits through recreation.gov (search: Mount Margaret). This info should be included in trail descriptions under the permits section. https://www.recreation.gov/wildernessAreaDetails.do?contractCode=NRSO&parkId=111240 We hiked from the Norway Pass TH to Obscurity Lake via Bear Pass, camped at Obscurity Camp and did a short side trip on to Panhandle Lake. It's worth noting that Obscurity Camp is a little distance beyond the lake itself and does not have lake views. Somebody (assuming WTA?) has very recently done nice work clearing brush and widening the trail between Grizzly Lake and Obscurity Lake. Thanks! Except for a few mosquitoes around sunset bug activity was light. I never broke out the bug juice. There are some nice late-season flowers still going - paintbrush, asters, etc. But a great reason to go right now is...HUCKLEBERRRIES! I have never seen such a bumper crop of berries. There are long stretches of the trail where you don't have to stop to pick, you just keep continuously grabbing berries as you hike along. Even the campsite itself was full of loaded bushes. My hands are still blue.	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-14.0070393720
Cougar Divide	MadMapper	Obstacles on trail:	    Trees down across trail,	    Overgrown in places,	    Mud/Rock slide or washout.	Posting this to save others some possible grief. I strongly recommend NOT attempting this hike at present. I went with my hardiest hiking companion and not only did we have to cut the trip short, we were both grumpy afterward. Challenges: 1) The road is washed out worse than ever. Consequently it’s still gated at the bottom so you’ll have to walk or bike the 12+ miles and 3700 feet of vertical to even see the trailhead. If you choose to ride, keep in mind carrying your backpack gear while riding a bike is much harder than just riding a bike. And getting past the washouts will involve dangerous, exposed and soaking events, all made more challenging if you’re dragging a loaded bike. 2) The bugs are formidable. Being long time Cascade hikers we aren’t bug squeamish but at higher elevations here the mosquitoes get to apocalyptic densities. Even wearing head nets we struggled to remain calm. Lots of mosquitoes crawled up under my net and I managed to inhale several, resulting in wracking spasms of coughing. Toss in some horseflies for the occasional nasty zinger and you’ve got the general idea. 3) The trail hasn’t been maintained for a long time (no surprise) and is difficult to follow in places. It also requires scrambling under, over and around multiple large deadfalls. 4) The smoke (mid-August 2018) is dreary and obscures views of Baker and other nearby peaks. According to a MBSNF ranger the road repair work that was slated to happen this summer hasn’t made it onto the schedule yet. Honestly, the biggest washout looks like something that would require very substantial time, equipment and money to repair. Or perhaps a complete rerouting of the road. And the higher part of the road, beyond Bar Creek, is no longer publicly maintained so the multiple slides, washouts and overgrown sections would have to be repaired and maintained with private funds. It’s hard to see how that happens. Maybe this is an area that could be left to revert to wilderness with trails instead of roads. Wells Creek / Bar Creek is a beautiful glacier fed valley that might someday make a fine long hiking route to the north side of Baker.

Boulder River	Kronst	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	:  4 of 5 stars (up to the second waterfall – lower rating after the waterfalls)   :  This is a nice hike.  The first double waterfall is beautiful.  It’s worth climbing down to it to explore and get pictures.  The second waterfall is okay.  Also, I’d advise people to turn around after the second waterfall (at about 1.5 miles) because the scenery does not change very much—you’re walking through beautiful old growth forest—unless you want to have an aerobics walk without much of an elevation gain.  Overall, the hike is an easy hike, which you can take kids on (but watch them, sometimes there is a long drop off the side of the trail).   : Horrible pot holes.  I guess one can get there with a sedan, but I’m so glad I had an SUV (Toyota Highlander).  I got there about 2 pm on a Sunday afternoon and there was parking.   :  None.   :  None.   :  Great.   Almost to the first waterfall, on the old roadbed, one could take a stroller, this part of the trail is very well maintained—flat without many roots and rocks.  Although past the first waterfall, there are places that are muddy, rocky, rooty.  Not bad though.   :  Not bad!  I used Neem bug spray.   : This trail took me (a 60-year-old guy) about 6 hours, with about a half hour exploring near the first waterfall.  I also went all the way to the end of the campsites.     :  Very nice waterfall views.      :  Minimal.

Talapus and Olallie Lakes	geezopeezos	Minor obstacles posing few problems	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	This was my first backpacking trip, so I chose the not so far away Olallie Lake as a base camp. I arrived at the trailhead Sunday morning at 0800. The parking lot was already half full with overnighters. I noted that 'bugs were not too bad' but I definitely wore bug spray and had long pants on. There were mosquitos, but no black flies. It was better than a hike here last weekend. BE AWARE Vehicle break-ins occurred at the Talapus Lake Trailhead on 8/11. Do not leave any valuables in your vehicle. BE AWARE I arrived to Olallie Lake around 1030 and found an established campsite on the north end. It was the first one on the right after the second vault toilet. Around 1130 I chose to head out for a day hike to Rainbow and Island Lakes. The hike to Rainbow Lake was not super strenuous, but the jaunt up and down to get there was a bit surprising, and tired me out. There are great views along the entire trail. Beautiful flowers and plentiful huckleberries to snack on as you go. Rainbow Lake was enjoyable, except for one noisy group  of at least three people who were camping or resting nearby. I rested for 20 mins on a rather large and comfortable rock, and then decided to head to Island Lake. On the way to Island Lake there is a vault toilet spur with a SPECTACULAR view. Don't miss out! I would guess that it is Talapus Lake below. One other person showed up 30 sec after I arrived, but that was the only other person I saw while I spent 20-30 mins exploring around the lake. I found an established campsite, where a dead tree had fallen right on the level area where a tent would go! This cautions you to ALWAYS be aware of the hazards when choosing a camp site. I took my photos, filtered some water from the creek flowing off the lake, and then headed back to Olallie Lake for the night. It was a great experience, but for my first trip it was difficult to find a way to sleep comfortably. #hike-a-thon	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-13.6730778894
Martin Creek Connector	nUTmAN	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Trail was in excellent condition as it had rained hard the previous day. No mud very little water other than creeks of course. Hike in from Scenic to the upper grade and at the martin creek connector hiked the lower grade back to Scenic. Lower grade was much busier that the upper grade but not to many people, most of the day we were alone on the trail.

Eightmile Lake	steffunny	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	We opted for Eightmile Lake after reading about how crowded it is on the weekend at Colchuck. Eightmile Lake is a nice alternative in the same area! We arrived just before 11am on a Sunday and easily found parking at the trailhead. There were only a few other groups on the trail, and a few campers at the lake. Even though the sky was rather hazy from the nearby wildfires, it was still a really nice hike, and very peaceful at the lake. You are never far from the sounds and sights of Eightmile Creek gushing past. We saw lots of wildlife - squirrels, chipmunks, pikas, grouse, and a deer. Many birds at the lake - violet-green swallows, hummingbirds, junkos, and either kinglet or warblers. Plenty of wildflowers too! Trail is in good condition - a mix of dusty, dry paths but also some wet and muddy patches. We applied bug spray before we started the hike, but there really didn't seem to be many bugs around! 	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-13.9379433880
Tumac Mountain Loop (Trails 980, 44, 2000, 980)	HBell	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Went on a pleasant loop hike yesterday with the dogs. This loop (trails 980, 44, 2000, and 980) has a good day hike distance (~12 or 13 miles) and nice climb (2000 feet) up to a 360-degree view at Tumac Mountain.  Then it's all easy downhill coasting the rest of the way. As far as wildflowers, I noticed only a few patches of lupine. Trail 44 is pretty severely rutted in many stretches, but no blockages. The stretch of PCT (Trail 2000) is especially serene and in good condition. I couldn't help but notice some suds on the shore of the eastern of the Twin Sisters Lakes. Campers please don't dump soap into wilderness lakes. The road to the trailhead is pretty rocky and it's probably best to use a high-clearance vehicle; however, I got lucky and had no mishaps with my Mercedes sedan.

Fragrance Lake	carol	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Fairly easy, in-the-shade hike on well-used, well-maintained trail; just right for my partner's bit of arthritis. Reforested with lots of space, light, breezes and ferns. Parking was full at the trailhead when we arrived at 11 am on a Sunday, but you can park across the road at the State Park where they have clean bathrooms with flush toilets. Hikers were well-spread-out and friendly; there were several places around this small but lovely lake to stop for lunch or a brisk swim.

Mount Daniel	Cairn	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were an annoyance	Intermittent snow - not hard to cross	Looks like there are several recent trip reports offering excellent information about the SE ridge route. Just a couple things that may be helpful: . The two easiest methods (we used both) are: 1. A steep bootpath up through the trees. You access this path by taking a left (west) off the main trail that leads from the north end of Peggy's pond over to the toilet near(ish) Hyas Creek. I only saw one toilet, not two, although there were many signs leading to it. 2. Clambering up the rocky ramp between two large rock outcroppings. See photo above (NOTE: I'm NOT referring to the rocky basin with large cairns marking it. I'm guessing these cairns mark the route via Hyas Glacier?) If you take this route, you'l l go up the rocks and then veer left to scramble to the top of a little ridge with trees. At this point, you will be at the top of the boot path that is described in #1. We took this way up in the morning b/c the bootpath would have left us soaking wet (water on trees/undergrowth). '. On the way up to the West Summit, we opted for staying on the rocky ridge, which was fine--a couple Class 3 (maybe?) moves with some exposure that got my heart racing b/c I felt like the rock was loose and crumbly in some places. (Oh, OK, and because I can be a weeny sometimes.) On the way down, we DID cross the snow, which I'd guess was 25-30 degrees at the most. See photo below. It was a great choice for us. We had helmets, ice axes and crampons (which made us a lot heavier, ugh.)  So, know your preferences/comfort level and choose accordingly.

Boulder River	hannahp7	Obstacles on trail:	    Trees down across trail,	    Muddy or wet trail.	Road rough but passable	Lovely cool weather hike - the shade was wonderful.

Minor bugs that were not bad at all. 	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-13.2965362349
Huntoon Point	MountainNinja	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	I decided to make the 3 hour drive to HP yesterday from Seattle, with my 11 year old daughter in tow. This was my first successful trek in the area, I had to abort on three previous snowshoe camping attempts due to weather and avy dangers. Route finding can be very difficult in the snow up there, yesterday's trip was like turning on "cheat mode" for recon'ing the area for the upcoming snow season. The clouds broke obediently to the tune of the weather forecasts, only to reveal some layers of smoke. We made it to the parking lot at the end of 542 around 2pm, there was a ton of tourists as I had expected, finding a space was not a huge challenge at that time of day though. I started recording the track on my Garmin from Heather Meadows, in case I need references this Winter. I threw on my pack with about 30lbs of weight for a small degree of training effect and hit the trails with my daughter. We covered every square inch of trails on the ridge, I don't think there was a single obstacle that posed any challenges for her, but if you're taking children out there with you - be sure to teach them how to climb safely and keep three points of contact at all times when negotiating the rocks (some of them are very sharp too!). When we got to the end of the HP trail loop, we lost the crowds of people and got to enjoy the views with some serenity. I did not realize how many wild blueberries were growing up there, they are small (Alaskan or Oval blueberries?), but very sweet and perfectly ripe right now! I was hoping that the view of the glaciers and Shuksan would have been better, but the clouds hid the last 10% of the summits, and the haze kind of muted everything a bit. Still no regrets, the temps hung around 61F the entire time we were up there, my daughter had a great time, and the data I collected made the trip an overall success.

Gothic Basin	Beangod3	Obstacles on trail:	    Trees down across trail,	    Difficult stream crossing(s),	    Muddy or wet trail.	Hiked Gothic Basin for the first time for Hike-a-thon. It starts out lovely and gentle.. then after the first creek crossing goes up and up. After the 2nd stream crossing is when the scrambling begins. Thankfully I'm built like a mountain goat and thrive in scrambling but other may not. Some of the rocks were wet and muddy from the rain the night before. Over all a tough hike but not too bad. I made it up in just over 3 hours. If it had been hotter things might not have gone so well.  Ate lunch in the basin. Explored a little. I had originally planned to backpack the night before but the storms stopped me... which I'm thankful for... knowing how many people back pack up there, there didn't seem to me to be that many spots to camps. I didn't check Foggy Lake so maybe there are a ton more there.  Lots of items people lost scattered up the trail, a jacket, one puma sandle, a hat, sunglasses, a tee-shirt... and of course... two bags of dog poop.

Little Annapurna	HusbandWifePuppy	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Started our trip as an attempt at Dragontail but had to bail... so we scrambled/traversed over to Little Annapurna which turned out to be a pleasant “Plan B”. The 360 views are pretty incredible, with lots of flat rocks to lounge on- they felt like couches! The walk down Little Annapurna spur is easy with a nice grade. We did that as an out-and-back via aasgard. 17 miles RT and 7000 feet elevation gain... but this includes the Dragontail attempt and some route-finding. I think without that extra stuff it would be around 5300’ and 15 miles RT. Totally worth it if you are in the core zone or want a long day hike in the enchantments without having to do the thru-hike/shuttle business. Lots of mama and baby goats!

Ashland Lakes	meaganmc07	Trail in good condition	Road recommended for high clearance only	No bugs	Snow free	Was unable to complete this hike due to the pot holes in the road.

Snow Lake	Dan Baird	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	Arrived at 7:30am to a parking lot that was already half full and filling fast. That's saying something because the lot is huge! My theory is that because it was rainy yesterday, everybody (including me and my wife) put off their weekend hike til today. So the trail was busssssy!  Still, we were early enough to make our way up more or less apart from other groups, with some peace and solitude. The trees were misty in the early morning which was nice. The trail starts off with a brief climb for a quarter of a mile, then is more or less level til the halfway point. From there it climbs upwards via a series of switchbacks. The ground is covered in rocks, which slowed the hike down a bit for me and also meant I had to concentrate on where I was stepping. Once you reach the top there is a viewpoint above the lake, and you can head down to the lake to reach the waters edge. Fortunately, the mist started to lift and the sun came out just after we arrived. Down by the lake the bugs were annoying. They weren't mosquitoes but small flies, the type that swarm around you making it their mission to get up your nose or into your eye. For that reason we only stayed long enough to have a snack then headed back to the lot. On the way down we passed a ton of people (over a hundred I'd estimate), making me glad I arrived early. Though the amount of people meant the usual annoyances were present! All in all, I'd do this hike again, but never on a busy summer weekend!	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-12.9984727528
Snow Lake	Mrs. Sabin	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were terrible	Snow free	Hit the trail at 7:15am Sunday morning, plenty of cars already there but the upper lot wasn’t quite half full. Took about 1hr 15min for me to reach the top of the lake. And then another 15ish to get down to the lake. Traffic started to get thick going down to the lake. And the bugs were bad bad bad. I wore a bug net on my head, I highly recommend getting one. Lake was socked it for awhile, started to break open around 9:45, heading out shortly after. Getting down the trail was a challenge, lots and lots and lots of folks and their dogs coming up. Very few practiced good trail etiquette letting us down. There was a ranger at the lake and then at the trailhead when we got down. Highly recommend bringing hiking poles, lots of rocky sections. And go early!!

Lord Hill Regional Park	LordHillBandit	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Needed to get out in the woods, but didn't feel like a hike. A walk sounded better. I know just the place! Haven't done an all-dayer here for awhile, so thought I would do the Western Loop and just mosey around. Got there at 10am to a half full lot, and left at 7pm to a quarter full lot. Guess that qualifies as all day. The Startup Trail is in great shape - ironically, now that's it's CLOSED. At the top, I cut over to the Second Spring. The ferns need brushed, but it looks like the trail is getting some regular use. It had been in danger of disappearing. Speaking of disappearing, the Ridgeside is in danger of just that. It's billed as a primitive trail; but right now it looks like one of those old, abandoned trails. Easy enough to follow, but very overgrown. Needs a good brushing just to maintain trail status. Don't wear shorts... The Riverview is in great shape, although I found some trash for the first time at the viewpoint. Watched a bald eagle feeding a pair of juveniles across the river. Noisy. Got to the Quarry Bowl and chilled for a bit under the cedar, then headed north on the Midway. Midway S. is in great shape also, although there is no water in the stream. Took the opportunity to fix one of the crossings. Hopefully someone leaves it alone this time so it doesn't continue to erode the bank. Chilled for awhile at the Viewpoint, and worked on a cedar knot I found on the trail. A half hour with a sharp stick and I got it looking pretty good. And to think people were kicking it down the trail! Sometimes, you don't see the beauty, simply because you're not looking for it... Midway N. still has the "bridge" out over the creek near the start. Plenty doable, just pick your way carefully. Cut over to the Midway Cutoff so I could come out at the white gate by the horse lot. All clear; in fact, it looks like it's getting a lot more use. (it's a handy shortcut.) It was a great day in the woods! With the deluge yesterday, it was a humid day, full of woodsy smells. Free aroma therapy! I am now ready for the work week...	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-12.1138327916
Ebey's Landing	bexlosingit	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	I started in the cemetary parking lot, strolling through the plots. On a whim, I ended up on the bluff trail without realizing the length of that particular path, or the height of some of the 'drop off points' of the bluff. Despite a bit of anxiety due to my fear of falling, the hike was lovely, a good way to break up my road trip. The different view points from this trail are stunning, though not for those with height issues! I'm glad the weather was still pretty cool for a summer day - this is a hike I'd love to do again in the fall. Beautiful, worth the time for sure, I couldnt get enough of that view!!

Chain Lakes Loop	hikingwithmylover	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Intermittent snow - not hard to cross	Arrived at the trailhead with a bit of drizzle and fog, but somehow the limited views of Baker and Shuksan allowed us to focus on the wildflowers and closer views around us. Went clockwise up to Artist Point and beyond, definitely a wise decision to get the elevation gain behind us at the beginning rather than at the end. Next time, we will start at Artist Point and head counterclockwise, met a few groups along the way that had chosen this particular route. A few ripe huckleberries primarily in the Heather Meadows area but many more will be coming soon throughout most of the trail. Lakes are beautiful, as always, and lots of views along the way to keep the mind occupied. Very few snow fields to cross, mostly at the turnoff to Ptarmigan Ridge. Bugs were somewhat of a nuisance primarily at Iceberg Lake but we also did not use any bug repellent.	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-12.3797343595
Mailbox Peak	06rugroash	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	My best advice for someone who hasn’t hiked this before? Read as many of these trip reports as you can. If I had not been aware of the boulder field before reaching it, it would have messed up my mental game for sure. There is a path up through the boulder field, so it’s not like freestyle rock climbing or anything. And the top of the boulder field is not the end. Fit that into your mental game as well. There is still a steep uphill battle after you clear the boulder field.  It was in the upper 50s when I got to the parking lot at 6:45am this morning. That cool temp was appreciated most of the way. The only time I wished it had been warmer was when I got to the mailbox. It was perfectly positioned in the middle of a huge, damp cloud. I got cold pretty quickly and had to head back down quicker than I’d like. Consider layers if that sounds like something that might happen to you. I’d like to do this again on a clear day. Visibility was limited at the mailbox, but I did get some good views along the way.	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-12.7234213617
Marshall's Hill	EmilB	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	: I parked at the top of Newcastle's 146th Place SE and walked up the Water Tank access road.  At 2 PM on a partly cloudy Sunday, mine was the only car. : This trail is unique in that it has a high elevation (about 1000 ft), is fairly flat (gently rolling up and down until the drop at its eastern end), and doesn't require a steep hike in or out (if you park on 146th).  So, if you want a high-elevation Cougar experience without many 100s of vertical feet, this is your hike. : The trail winds gently up and down through tall trees and over thick roots.  I rarely saw houses and crossed paths with two other parties.  The silence was only broken by the sound of yipping coyotes in the distance. : When I was a kid, I would have enjoyed seeing the huge Water Tank at the top of the paved access road.

Scorpion Mountain	vanlohe66	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	We hiked Johnson Ridge to Scorpion Mountain for the first time today. We didn’t get to see the surrounding mountains because of cloud cover, but it was a treat to walk through the cool misty dripping forest after all of our hot days. Mosquitoes were minimal and bug spray worked well. There weren’t a lot of flowers, but there was a nice variety. We only passed about 20 people all day.  I can’t wait to hike this trail again on a clear fall day, but with some reservations. There were empty shells and shot out beer cans in the parking lot. We heard a few gun shots down in the valley on the way up and then ran into a hunter with an orange vest and rifle in hand near the overlook to Lake June. In all of my years hiking in the Cascades that has never happened to me. On the way back, we heard 150+ gun shots and as we reached the parking lot, 2 more guys (not in hunting gear) came out of the woods behind us with rifles.  I don’t know if this is common on this trail, but it was not a comfortable experience. 	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-12.5109030860
Muddy Meadows/Foggy Flat	WildBill	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	Hiked a nice circuit route this weekend with a friend, beginning and ending at the Muddy Meadows trailhead. To begin with the road is drivable for most higher clearance vehicles like SUV's and Subi's. Might even make it in most other vehicles if you take it slow and careful. The trail to the PCT junction is in good shape. We ran into a few horse packers who were on their way down from Foggy Flats who said the bugs were real bad up that way so we modified our plans and headed right (south) on the PCT.  We set up camp beside Killen Creek in an obvious camp area a short ways after the junction with trail  #114. Good water source there and plenty of good campsites.  After a quick snack we packed up dinner, our stoves and some water and headed up the trail to High Camp. (trail #10) The trail to High Camp is steep in places and probably not the best for kids. Ran into a Forest Service backcountry ranger named Kevin who was carrying a large shovel to High Camp which he said he was going to use to improve the camp.  Thank you Forest Service rangers!  You guys rock!  Ate dinner near High Camp and watched the sunset. The close up views of Mt Adams' glaciers, and far off views of Mt Rainier are well worth the climb! Then we headed back to Killen Creek camp for the night.  The next day we decided to hike out Killen Creek trail #113.  Beautiful meadows and views of Mt Adams! Absolutely love this area!  Decided to hike the road back to the Muddy Meadows trailhead in spite of the dust clouds from passing cars and trucks! Mount Adams Wilderness has always been one of my favorite places to explore! I will definitely be back!!	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-12.0553859058
Lake Valhalla	Sarah_Anne	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	This is a beautiful trail that a lot of maintaining work has obviously gone into. After a short elevation gain it is basically flat the entire way to the lake. We got a late start so while the trail was crowded everyone was polite and courteous. When we got to the lake, I did see someone smoke and put a cigarette out in the ground. The ignorance of some is astounding. Other than that, it was a wonderful hike. There are some great camp sites and places to explore once you reach the lake and I will definitely be back.	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-12.1251336251
Beaver Lake	bungyjumper	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	I chose "Trail in good condition" as it is a great, level trail for about a mile and a half. Then you get to the totaled bridge. Other postings have said it's passable, but with my dog, I decided to turn around. Disappointed that I didn't get to lunch on the river, I did find a do it yourself trail about a quarter mile back that led to the river without too much acrobatics. I got to lunch, the dog got to play in the river. All's right in the world. Only two other people on the trail the whole way.

Jade Lake	susanjmunn	Obstacles on trail:	    Muddy or wet trail.	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were terrible	Decided to do this in a day on Sunday. The original plan was to backpack, but with the rain, we didn't want to deal with wet gear and wet dog smell. Started at the Deception Pass trailhead at about 7:15. The trail was muddy from the recent storms. Many of the trees that were down on the trail previously have been cleared out leading up to Marmot Lake. The previous trip reports do a great job of describing the trail after Marmot. You need good route finding skills. There are some cairns to follow. Like a previous report mentioned, to get to Dip Top Gap at the fork at the end of Jade Lake definitely, take the right fork and go down to the lake and then up. It's a lot safer and quicker. We were down at the Jade Lakes shore (right before the ascent to Dip Top Gap) by 1 pm and took an hour lunch break here. Made it up to Dip Top Gap in about an hour. With the lower temperatures, microspikes were useful on the way up. They're probably not useful on a hot or sunny day. This can be done right now without gear for sure. There are small sun cups and they help as well. Poles would be useful. Stayed up at Dip Top Gap for almost an hour. The clouds were rolling in and out. It was refreshing up here because the mosquitos were not present. We didn't glissade down because of the sun cups and lots of small rocks were everywhere on the snow. We kind of ran down while sliding a bit without the microspikes. Took us about 14 hours total, this includes hiking (with heavyish packs) and our breaks. According to my GPS, it was about 24 miles total. Side note: The mosquitos are terrible! I was wiping mosquito carcasses off my arms after slapping them for most of the trail. Also was stung by a bee. Be careful out there!	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-16.4468970541
Lincoln Park	Jenica	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	We put in some Hike-a-thon miles at Lincoln Park this weekend! Easy stroller access paths down-to and along the beach. There are non-paved, steeper trail options if you are sans stroller. Lots of beautiful Madrona trees (I'll link to a document the City of Seattle published about the different trees at the park), picnic tables and shelters, playground with swings for kids, Colman pool and plenty of beach with mountain views. This particular evening everything was golden pink from hazy skies. This is a great in-city option for enjoying a beautiful walk with family.  	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-16.5388704030
South Puyallup To Wonderland	Elizabeth “Ducky”	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Another beautiful day for trail work with WTA during #HikeaThon After a week of not working on this trail we picked up where we left off July 29. Our work began about .6 miles from the trail head. This portion of trail does have one large step about a foot and a half high, that hopefully we will be able to fix before the summer is over. The trail also has some ferns and huckleberries infringing on the trail in some places.There are also a about three little creeks that had been dried up last time we were up there, but due to the recent rain they were flowing, but not that much to where you still couldn't just step over them. The part of the trail that has been washed out, can get confusing a some points so just look for the pink flagging. Half of the group worked on a re-route where the South Puyallup River has washed away the trail. This group was able to finish 'scratching' in the entire length of the re-route for the park to come out an approve of it before the next step of work beings. The rest of us worked up the trail about another quarter of a mile on the actual South Puyallup Trail. We worked on widening a section of trail that is on a steep bank above the river. We were able to widen the trail from about a foot wide to about three and a half feet wide. 6 of us worked on the other side of the 'hump' improving the back slope, removing rocks from  the up hill side of the trail and creating little rock retaining walls in order to stabilize the trail. Not many hikers on this trail even in nice weather. There was only one hiker on the trail during the day. Unlike last time we were working on this area of trail, there were no bugs out today, maybe it was due to the weather and beautiful drizzle that we need oh so bad. Come out and join us on the trails sometime, it's a ton of fun, and you get a better application for hiking trails. wta.org/volunteer If you'd like to give back to WTA and their trail crews right now is Hike A Thon through the end of August, feel free to donate any amount of money to my campaign by going to give.wta.org/Elizabeth Hikes Until next time- Happy Trails	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-15.0904270472
Mount Pilchuck	lanceH	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	Hiked here with my son on Sunday. We arrived at about 9:10 am and the parking lot was about 3/4 full. Trail was wet from the rains the day before. Going up the bugs were almost non existent. I took it somewhat easy since this was only my second hike of the year (Did Wallace falls earlier in the week up to the top falls) and my son and I hiked together for about half way up the trail, then he took off. He is young and ambitious and did the same the year before so I somewhat expected it. Going up, there weren't a ton of hikers, I think we passed a few groups and a couple of groups passed us. It was pretty foggy so there were not any lookout points we could stop at and enjoy the views. I made it up in an hour and forty five minutes while my son made it up about ten minutes before me. The lookout was a little crowded but not overcrowded. We could not see any views due to the fog. We decided to rest and see if the fog would lift but did not in the hour we were up there. By the time we left, the lookout was overcrowded and we had to wait a few minutes to get down the ladder. On the way down, there were quite a few hikers making their way up, so I am glad we left when we did. There were more bugs on the way down and they were beginning to irritate me. I think we made it down in about an hour and a half, this time sticking together the whole time. When we got down the parking lot was completely full and cars were parked on the side of the road out to the sign, somewhat expected for a weekend. A great hike but we did not get to see the fabulous views from the lookout due to the fog.	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-14.9970704455
Chuckanut Falls	Rosie311	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	This was a great hike to take my cousin. The trail is well maintained, with some walkways/boardwalks throughout. There are a lot of other trails that connect to this one, so I recommend taking a picture at the beginning, or you could easily veer the wrong way. We went around 10am and the parking lot was only half full, so there weren't a lot of people on the trail. The trail is all in the forest, so you enjoy tree cover the whole way. Unfortunately the falls was dried up this time of year, so we were a little disapointed when we arrived, but we enjoyed the journey. There is some elevation gain here, so it is not just a stroll through the woods, but my 10 year old cousin had no problem. 	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-14.1136546397

Lake Dorothy - Lake Bear - Lake Deer	IronBoots	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	        I've wanted to revisit this hike for many years.  Years ago my daughters and I did the hike up to Dorothy lake and we really enjoyed the trip, but we stopped at Dorothy and never went beyond.  The drive past Money Creek Campground isn't to bad.  I believe all cars could make it, just keep an eye out for potholes and the one or two areas where the road is a bunch of rocks for about thirty feet or so. Once I arrived at the trailhead I thought I might have to put some rain gear on, as it was a damp, cool day with the clouds fairly low.  However it wasn't to cold, and the main comment from other hikers was the dew and raindrops on all the vegetation.  As you brushed passed them on the trail you tended to get somewhat soaked. The trail climbs feeling more like stairs than walking at times.  But as you walk in the old growth forest, the 1.5 miles go quickly passing you come to Dorothy Lake. This time instead of taking the right spur and visiting the lake, I went on to Bear, Deer and Snoqualmie Lakes.  The path along the 2 mile long lake was peaceful, and there are  quite a few places where people can camp by the shore, and see Big Snow Mountain.  Near the South end of the lake I remembered seeing what I thought were some falcons  on my last trip.  Sure enough it seems as though the trees on the island have been kept up as the family roost for at least a generation or two.       The trip up to Bear Lake has one very small stream crossing so pair of dry socks might be handy for later, and the hike to get to Bear Lake is a little steep, but still doable for some kids.  Once you are at Bear Lake it's easy to sit down and enjoy the view.  Deer and        The whole trip was roughly a 12 mile round trip with plenty of stops for pictures, berries, and some bird watching. Once up past the main lakes, it was quiet, peaceful, and serene.	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-13.4197991991
Snoqualmie Lake	SeaNative	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Day hike from Middle Fork trail head.  Wet to start with drizzle/rain first hour or so them a drippy forest trail most of the way to the fork leading up into the Alpine Lake Wilderness.  A big thanks to the Forest Service Trail Crews for clearing most of the blow down logs congesting the trail for this ascent.  A month ago i didn't make it thru all the way to the lake due to the slow down.  Much less water in the creeks at this time but still opportunities to fill water bottles as needed.  Met 2 camping couples on the way out and arrived at Lake about 11 am.  A light cool breeze kept the bugs at bay even on the Lake shore.  Campgrounds were empty and lunched and rested on a nice soft sandy beach by a large campsite. i had some nice wild blueberry snacking during a few rest stops.  The cooler temperatures on this particular day were a blessing and the hike was  thoroughly enjoyable except for some tired feet thanks to the rocky portions of the trail back on the old logging roadbed.

Tubal Cain Mine	Anna	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	This is a plea to all the lady hikers out there. Please, please, please bury your TP or pack it out. When we got out to the main camp at Tubal Cain, we had to dig holes and bury three peoples' toilet paper. Carry a shovel, bring a bandanna to use instead of TP, or bring a Ziploc and carry it out. It's not rocket science - let's leave the forest better than we found it.  Also, if there's a fire ban, please respect it. The folks across the creek from us chopped down branches from trees and built a roaring fire. It was really dry up there in spite of the recent rain. One spark going awry and you have an emergency on your hands.  Trail in has a nice grade - steady climb. The side trail up to the plane crash site is easy to miss, and is quite steep. The ruins are really neat - strewn all over the valley. There were lots of nice sites up at Tubal Cain camp. Fair warning - the stream on the left of the campsites comes straight off the tailings. The one on the right is cleaner.	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-13.2224309550
Mount Pilchuck	IRMoczygemba	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	This was a great hike for our family! It was challenging at times and we took many breaks (for seasoned hikers this would be no issue, but none of us had gone hiking in years). The views at the top were INCREDIBLE, even with the fog! You do have to scramble over some huge boulders to be able to make it into the structure at the top which was the only sketchy part, other than that very do-able and completely worth it for the gorgeous scenery. 	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-13.7593680659
Spray Park	Hiking Mom	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were not too bad	Intermittent snow - not hard to cross	We started this at 9 am on a Sunday. The main parking lot at Mowich Lake was full when we arrived and cars were just starting to park on the side of the road. We hiked almost all the way up to Seattle Park. Elevation gain was around 2,000 feet in total, and total hike was 8.5 miles roundtrip. The only snow on the trail was near the end of Spray Park, and it was easy to cross. The bugs weren't bad and could be kept away with bug spray. The wildflowers were past their prime but there were still plenty to see. What stood out to me especially: Bog Genetian, White Heather, Rosy Spirea, Magenta Paintbrush, American Bistort, and a few lingering Avalanche Lilies. There were many huckleberries along the trail as well. There were so many marmots on this trail - it was incredible. The best was seeing the five babies marmots with their mother. At another point we saw two marmots chasing each other through the snow.   	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-13.8847851376
Killen Creek to High Camp	volcanogirl73	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Driving tips if coming from the North:  Due to the FR 23 closure, I took the detour given at the Ranger Station in Randal. I came from Puyallup. This took me over 4.5 hours over 164 miles. On the way back, I ended up going down 141, to I-85 and back up I-5.  This was a 202 mi. trip that only took 3.5 hours.  Less gas as most of it is hwy speed.  Due to the detour, I got to the trailhead around 10:30am and the parking lot was full. Most everyone was coming down as I was going up since I was headed up on a Sunday. It took me about 3 hours to get up, but I was taking my time taking photos and relaxing as this was my first time at Mount Adams. Note:  This trail was mostly dry with very little running water along the route.  Take enough water for your stay. Most streams are dry and I remember one at the beginning that was trickling.  At the top, there is the glacier, but the streams from the glaciers are at a trickle. Also, there is no cover for much of the hike, so bring sunscreen. You will also need bug spray for the first half.  The first 3 miles of this is the first 1500 ft elevation and pretty gradual. Not too bad and nice views.  Once you get to the PCT intersection, the landscape changes.  Everything is rocky and dusty. You will start seeing 	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-15.8385515664
Perry Creek	ryanjames	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Little Sunday hike, parked in the shared Perry Creek and Mount Dickerson Trailhead. Arrived around 10 or 10:30a and still plenty of spots. Hike up the canyon was beautiful, very green and wet on an overcast/smoky day. The falls were a nice way to break up the hike, stopped for a snack before starting the switchbacks up to Mount Forgotten Meadow. Saw just a handful of people on the way up. Made it to the meadow in about 3 hours, broke for lunch for about half an hour, and the way down took about 2:15 or 2:30. Saw earlier trip reports about bears on the sign in log at the trailhead--we didn't see any, but there are definitely plenty of berries out. The trail is very easy to follow, and I would imagine the meadow to be even more beautiful on a day with a view, but even so it was a relaxing and quiet destination. 	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-15.5337065279
Gothic Basin	jadrew	Obstacles on trail:	    Trees down across trail.	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	The Good: Went up to Gothic Basin to watch the Perseid Meteor shower Sunday night. Trail was in excellent condition, with all creek crossings being easily negotiated. Plenty of water sources along the way. As mentioned in previous posts, there are a couple of downed trees across the trail but they aren't hard to get around. Left the car around 5:15 and arrived at camp just past Gothic lake around 8:45. Heavy fog settled in, but cleared out by 3am just in time to catch the meteor shower! Heavy smoke was present by morning and severely limited visibility on the way down. The Bad: The human waste situation at the basin is out of control. People have been crapping anywhere and everywhere. Much of the ground in this area is rocky and it is often difficult/impossible to bury your waste so BE PREPARED TO PACK OUT YOUR POOP. Having piles of human waste in the open endangers an already fragile ecosystem, significantly impacts the enjoyability of the area and potentially compromises water sources downstream of this watershed. So please, leave no trace!	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-14.0456095037

Gothic Basin	erin_photo	Minor obstacles posing few problems	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	I haven’t written any reviews on here yet and honestly I don’t know if the audience I am writing this for is even on wta but as a reminder NO CAMPFIRES are allowed on this hike. There are several, I repeat... several campsites that you could see obvious handmade fire pits. This is such a beautiful spot and not just this hike... the whole PNW. If it all goes up in flames we all lose. I am not sure why people can be so selfish but they are also the ones that I’m sure left toilet paper along the trail as well. I try to pick up trash that I see on hikes but without gloves I was not willing to do that. Maybe I will add gloves to make hiking list but I shouldn’t have to.  Anyways, rant aside... the hike was gorgeous. The scenery changed several times and I don’t love repeating hikes (yet) because there are so many to see but this I may have to make an exception. I loved the waterfalls, the flowers, the jagged mountains etc Insanely beautiful!	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-13.2658915712
Ira Spring Trail - Mason Lake	ZiaT	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Although the forest road is suitable for all kinds of vehicles be aware of the patches of potholes on it. I reached there at 9:45 and that was a very bad idea cause the small parking lot was overflowing and had to park down the FR  . This trailhead is actually the start point for three popular destinations: Mason lake (which I did), Bandera Mountain and Mount Defiance ( little less crowded then the other two). That’s why the trail gets crowded and parking is hard unless you get there early. It’s a very beautiful hike once I came out of the forest! Someone mentioned that this trail gets much beautiful in fall season. I made it up to the Mason lake and skipped the Bandera Mount part , which lot of people on trail I met were doing or coming down with no views from the Bandera summit due to clound and haze. Bandera takes another 1000 ish feet of elevation gain than the Mason lake. If you wanna do the Bandera then do it on a clear day for the view that’s worth all the extra the toil and sweat!

Peggy's Pond	katedogg107	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	The gravel road to the trailhead is in pretty good shape and we saw many smaller sedans, but watch out for potholes and dips. The toilets are locked at the TH, but there are a few privies along the trail.  The trail is in great shape and gradually leads you up to an intersection with the PCT. The offshoot to Peggy's Pond is about a quarter or half mile beyond that, and it's about 1 mile to the pond. The first part of the trail to Peggy's Pond is exposed, steep, and on loose rock. We saw several backpackers and dogs (with packs) successfully navigating this short stretch of exposed trail, but there were a couple of day hikers that decided to turn back. If you are afraid of heights and not sure-footed, you might want to rethink this one. Having said that, we were able to get through this stretch with no problem, and were rewarded with the beautiful pond, and by following the glacial stream up toward Mt. Daniel, we were able to grab a stunning view of Cathedral Rock. It was a bit hazy due to wildfire smoke, but still gorgeous. Hope to come back for an overnight sometime!

Brown Creek	Daydreamer	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Trail is in good condition, well maintained. Even the benches along the way. In future maintenance perhaps the ""steep"" section could use some stairing for elderly if they choose to come down that side. Koodoes, to ya'll for the upkeep on this one. Oh I did not see this on the trail hiker map nor spider lake, WTA web reviewers might want to check that out. Thanks.

Sheep Lake to Sourdough Gap	kariedaway	Minor obstacles posing few problems	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	An easy going hike with fields of wildflowers and amazing views. We arrived a little later than we planned (9:45am) and parking lot was full, but there was plenty of room to park nearby along the 410. First 1.8 miles to Sheep Lake had a gradual elevation gain, paralleling the highway. Noise was pretty minimal and before long you veer to the left and you're in the woods. This section is ideal if you're looking to bring the kiddos and/or dogs and the lake is a good spot to cool off and enjoy lunch. There were several gray jays in the area begging for handouts. And maybe since rainstorms came through the day before there were no bugs to deal with. Just the bees enjoying the flowers. It was a picture perfect hike. From there we continued up to Sourdough Gap and were rewarded with amazing views! From the north side of the lake, walk over the small foot bridge and follow the trail up. We left our poles behind but I would recommend bringing them along if you plan to walk this portion of the trail. The loose rocks make it precarious if you're not paying attention.  Trail up to Sourdough has plenty of view points, unique rock formations, and meadows where you can pause and enjoy. Cloud cover kept most of Rainier hidden, but views to the north were spectacular.  Overall this hike was a great workout and very rewarding. Pup loved it too!

Palouse to Cascades Trail - South Cle Elum Trailhead	cascadesdj	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	The PTC Trail section east of South Cle Elum makes for a delightful outing on foot or mountain bike. I knew it would be socked in at the pass and all the I-90 hikes are ridiculously crowded on weekend, ergo this trip. Also, I live about 5 miles from where we started.  Today we wanted to get to the tunnel about 10 miles down the canyon, so we rode bikes. I start  a few miles east of S Cle Elum. There is good parking to be found if you go straight south on the main road through SCE, make the 90 degree turn left, go up the hill and on to Lower Peoh Point Road. Continue east under the freeway until you see the large bus turnaround on the left. It is closed to parking in the morning and late afternoon as the sign says. The trail from here follows the river with lots of good riparian views and  sections alongside nice wetlands, picnic areas, a campground, etc. Soon, you pass the confluence of the Teanaway and Yakima Rivers. Gradually, the landscape changes from wooded to sagebrush and more open country. You occassiomally see/hear cars on Hwy 10 (AKA the “River Road” to locals) and trains. We took our time and got to the tunnel in a little over an hour. It is long enough to get almost totally dark in the middle. Just past the tunnel is an old broken down farm and buildings. We turned around here and started back uphill (on a bike you realize there is some slope to this trail) and upwind. The trip today was comfortable, about 75 degrees, after the heat we’ve all been hiking in most of this summer. This trail is very scenic and always offers a new perspective on areas we drive by all the time. 	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-12.9431159886
Gem Lake	TiffanyBerry	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	Started at the Snow Lake Trailhead at Alpental early this morning - 6:30am - with a nearly empty parking lot, low clouds, and cool temperatures.  We didn't see many people on the way up, and just one pika who was happy to watch us walk by. The hike is classic - switchbacks, talus fields, confier shaded trail, dusty sections with no shade, talus fields, majestic lakes, semi-permanent snow caves... It's a little of everything.  And it has plenty of challenge for the average occasional hiker. Took us about three and a half hours to get to - and half the way around -  Gem Lake, since we weren't trying to push particularly hard.  Took about the same to get back to the trail because the highway traffic had headed into the mountains and there were strings of folks going both directions the whole way down from the lunch rock. Shout outs to: the ranger out there picking up trash, the three recent grads from my alma matter who chatted with me, all the hikers who did yield to the uphill hiker, and all the hikers who did pick up (and pack out) their dog's waste	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-12.9280509007
Miller Peninsula-Thompson Spit	dasaksa	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Started at the state park trail head at 4:30 pm. Temp was in the low 70s, but felt cooler in the shade (shady almost entire hike). Took us 1:15 out and a little more than :45 back. Retuned to pkg lot approximately 6:30. Trail was in great condition, we didn’t see any other hikers the entire hike.	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-12.6058802603
Bean Creek Basin	Fiver	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	We had a wonderful weekend doing our annual father/son backpacking trip to Bean Creek Basin.  This is a great hike to a beautiful basin.  A few tips from our trip to share: I would definitely recommend this hike as a great overnight option.

Mount Pilchuck	fineff5	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Arrived at the trailhead at 8am, and there were already about 10-15 cars in the lot. The road to the trailhead is gravel and has plenty of deep potholes, but if you drive slowly on the bad stretches or have a high clearance vehicle you should be fine. The trail itself is rocky but well-maintained, with plenty of signage to guide you across the slide areas.  You do have to climb over some boulders to get to the lookout, but you shouldn't have any problems accessing the ladder. Because of the popularity of the hike, there is some garbage around the lookout tower (pack it out!). The view was still clouded over when we were at the top, but we did catch some rocky peaks before the fog blew in. We ran into a constant stream of hikers on the way down, so if you get to the trail after 9am you'll probably have plenty of company. Overall a good morning workout, and a short trail for the elevation gain / views from the top!	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-12.2453046599
Granite Lakes	Stephen	Obstacles on trail:	    Overgrown in places.	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	We had saw reports that this trail didn't get a lot of use, considering its close proximity to Seattle. On some days maybe but today there were quite a few hikers out on the trail. Still some wildflowers left. First 2 miles of the trail is great -- steep in some sections but a well maintained trail to the bridge. After crossing the bridge the trail is overgrown in some sections so on a day like today when there had been rain the day before, it made for some wet sections. The creek crossings were not an issue today. Not too many views today as the clouds were pretty socked in but still the lake was nice. Would have been nicer if there were less people, especially some people who have loud voices and choose to smoke. We go to the mountains to get fresh air and quiet so that was a little letdown but overall still a good day out on the trail. Not much wildlife except for some birds and a few frogs.

Snow Lake	alyssacp22	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	Use the restroom before getting to the trailhead/parking lot!

I’ve seen other reports that they were closed for cleaning other days so I’m assuming they are never open.	Aug 12, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-12.4434102432
Melakwa Lake	Homegirl	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Completed this beautiful hike this morning with a couple friends and two furry ones.  We set out at 7 am - 8:50 Lake Melakwa - 10:30 back at the lot.  My phone clocked 9.5 miles total, 3.5 hours total only because we didn't hang out at the lake long.  The mosquitoes were there, not full-on assault, but still annoying - hey, this is nature.  We didn't encounter another soul until we headed back down the trail and then there was group after group heading up.  I'd love to do this again on a clear day, as you can tell from the photos it was cloudy and sprinkled some. There was plenty to look at the whole way up: waterfalls, river, lake, valleys, berries, and pretty wild flowers.  Two thumbs up!  You want to do this hike.

Colchuck Lake	Chewie616	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	I went here for a day hike on 8/11/18. My friend and I drove from Seattle starting at 5:30 AM and made it up to the parking lot by 8:30 AM. We didn’t even get to park in the parking lot because it was so crowded. A lot of people started to create their own parking spots later in the day, and boxed other cars in. So, I am totally happy that I didn’t park in the lot!! I just parked on the LEGAL side of the road-I would recommend this. My friend and I are in fairly good shape as we both play soccer and run 3-4 times a week, so we made it up in 2 hours and 15 minutes. This included breaks and picture taking. The last 30-40 min of the hike are a bunch of rocky switch backs, and that part of the trail I would consider “hard”. Every other part of the trail is moderate. We sat by the lake for 45-60 min and ate lunch sitting next to the super turquoise lake. It was a beauuuuutiful day. It reached a high of about 75ish, but the trail is well shaded and we both hiked in shorts and a T-shirt. The only super exposed part of the hike is when you get to rest at Colchuck, but even then you can find a spot to rest in the shade! As for footwear, we are lucky enough to have nice hiking shoes and our feet were totally fine on the rocky terrain. The trail is doable with tennis shoes...I just wouldn’t recommend it since it’s a long hike (4 hours for us total). There were 0 bugs out, and I think we were really lucky about this as I heard this trail could get buggy. I will definitely do it again.

Barlow Point	tigersfa8	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Hike Summary: Short hike but constant uphill. Trail has more of a natural path with not a lot of footprints, which was more scenic vs very popular hikes which have wider and very discernable pathways. Cloudy and misty day, therefore there was no view visible at the top. At the top, there isn't a lot of space for any real camping or comfortable place to setup for a quick lunch. For the amount of time it took to drive out here, I didn't find this hike very enjoyable because the round trip was very short. This is a beginners hike if you take it slowly (the slope adds a certain degree of difficulty).	Aug 11, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-13.6416876992

Lake Ingalls	ByRandomChance	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	No bugs	Snow free	Ended up trying Ingalls after a last-second change in plans and I’m so glad I did! My report probably won’t contain anything others haven’t said, but to reiterate: This is a stunning hike from the first step to the last. It’s mostly exposed, so bring sunscreen, and be ready to do a little detective work looking for cairns to mark the way toward the end. The road to the trailhead was pretty darn rough for my Prius, but still doable without being damaging. You’ll have a more pleasant ride in a higher-clearance car, but it isn’t required by any means.  We had no issue with bugs at any point during the day, and saw plenty of beautiful wildflowers, though it seemed like that will be winding down soon. Mountain goats were also out in force!  Be careful if you go climbing around the eastern edge of the lake. It’s a bit of a tricky path. Also remember LNT principles and be careful going off-trail. It can happen easily at certain points, but please stay on the trails as much as possible to avoid disrupting vegetation! We spent about two hours at the lake and by the time we were leaving - around noon - more hikers were rolling in. We passed a large number of people who were going up as we were going down - many were prepared to camp. Overall a really lovely hike and one I’m so glad to have experienced! What a beautiful place we are lucky to live in.	Aug 11, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-13.1718736375
Green to Cedar River Trail	Lucy W	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	What a wonderful hike! We were looking for something pretty easy, since we've been doing big climbs the last few weeks. This was a lovely, basically flat walk with a large system of trails so you could go as far or short as you'd like. It's through a pretty urban area, and at some points you're literally looking at someone's back patio! But the views of the lake and the tall trees were great, and the trail was well kept. Not great if you're looking for a challenge, but if you want something easy a little urban this is perfect!	Aug 11, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-13.5199823151
Sulphur Creek	brandnewbackpack	Obstacles on trail:	    Trees down across trail,	    Overgrown in places.	Road suitable for all vehicles	This was mildly disappointing.  We were on the hunt for the springs, armed with the description above and some other online and guidebook sources.  No dice however, as neither in our party felt good about the options for crossing the creek yesterday. The creek is pretty full right now.  There were a few large logs across its path but all were fairly high up, and it looked like any fall would be a rough one onto large rocks and into rushing water.  A lot of the other downed trees along the hike had loose, shale-like bark, and I'd already slipped once or twice clambering over them, so I decided not to risk a crossing attempt lest I lose my footing over the river.  We hiked upstream quite a bit looking for a milder place to cross but never found one (a section with a mid-river island looked slightly better because it split the river's flow but not enough to risk it for me). River aside, be prepared for a rough path with some bushwhacking and downed trees. There is a faint trail that continues past the log referenced above and supposedly leads to some remarkably large, old trees a couple miles in but at about 2 miles, near a boulder-filled valley, we ended up turning back because there were too many downers blocking the trail. The river is nice but nothing else remarkable about this trek, so unless you're prepared to cross and try for the springs or have a great love of bushwhacking through overgrowth, I'd probably recommend a different hike.

Navaho Pass	Jessica Winter-Stoltzman	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	We hiked to the meadow just before Navaho Pass on Saturday, camped there to watch the Perseid meteor shower, and then tagged Navaho Pass and Peak this morning before returning to the trailhead. Trail includes big rocks and loose dirt, so poles are nice, especially for the last section between Navaho Pass and Navaho Peak.  There were many other campers in the meadow, probably about 20 tents. Everyone PLEASE don't leave toilet paper on the ground, that is gross. Bury it or pack it out. (There is a toilet at the trailhead but none in the camping area.) For time estimation purposes, it took us 2.5 hours from the trailhead to the meadow, 1 hour from the meadow up to Navaho Peak, 45 minutes back from Navaho Peak down to the meadow, and 2 hours from the meadow down to the trailhead.  Views of the Stuart Range are fabulous, this hike is totally worth it. We could see the bottom 1/3 of Rainier and part of Adams amid clouds- would be amazing on a clear day. 	Aug 11, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-12.1752480838
Colchuck Lake	katie0537	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	No bugs	Snow free	Pictures still don’t do this hike justice. Arrived to a very full trailhead and probably 1/4mi line of cars along the road at 745 on a Saturday. Took us 3 hours to hike in at a moderate pace and less time on the way out. Highly recommend finding your own spot down to the water, there are several different spots to hang out at and some are busier than others. Make sure to pay attention to the paths you took to get to the water. There are several and it’s easy to mix them up. Partner and I got a little lost on the way out because trails over the rocks are harder to spot than trails of dirt.

Gem Lake	Linzlemon88	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	Arrived at the large parking lot at Alpental about 9:15am on Saturday. There were a lot of cars, but plenty of space to park.  Trailhead is to the right - cross the road, just before it dead-ends. You can't miss the trailhead (it's the only 1). I believe you are supposed to fill out a permit (permits are there & free. Just attach it to your pack). The trail was dry, and although it was a foggy day, the trail is beautiful the entire way.  We got stuck in a line of about 20people going up to Snow Lake. It was difficult to pass, even though the group knew we were right behind them, no one moved over for us for a solid quarter mile, which was obviously annoying. Once you go up, you must then go down towards snow lake. There is a fork in the trail here, follow it to the right and start your descent. The the left is a look out area. It's not very steep - we didn't need poles. Once you are basically at Snow Lake you can continue straight down to the lake, or travel across some rocks to the right & continue on. Continuing on will provide nice areas to sit & look out over the crystal blue lake water or even go down to swim. Solitary camping spots are located all around the lake, just follow the trail. Continuing on and you'll cross a foot bridge and continue in the lush forest to Gem Lake. Once you are really close to Gem Lake, like basically there close, the trail again splits in 2. You can continue on a rock path or down to the left on the dirt path. They both end up at the lake, only about 20 ft away from each other (so there are no wrong turns). Gem lake is exactly that. A tiny blue lake with steep mountains and forest surrounding it. It's stunningly blue (just like Snow Lake). This lake was more peaceful than Snow Lake, since it see's less visitors.  You can continue on to another lake, but we did not. There is a map at the trailhead that is very clear and provides mileage.  Bugs are bad near the lakes, but in the forest, along the trail, you hardly notice them.  We didn't hike this for time, especially since I couldn't stop taking photos. With the fog constantly moving and revealing bits and pieces of mountain peaks, I was constantly stopping for a photo. Plus you should account for a slow ascend, due to trail traffic (hopefully that won't be the case for you). With a lunch break at the far end of Gem Lake, it too us 5 hours round trip. We spent nearly an hour at Gem Lake. It rained on our hike back, and the rocks became rather slippery. Be careful with your footing, it is very rocky and Rooty in areas. Enjoy. Both lakes are beautiful. 	Aug 11, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-12.7269283834
Bean Creek Basin	DAHiker	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	No bugs	Snow free	Wonderful hike to get a little leg burn and heartbeat going.

Rachel Lake	tanalan	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	5 of us went on the morning of August 11th, and arrived at around 9am. The road to the trail was full of gravel, so it was good to slow down a little bit. There was plenty of parking when we arrived. The trail was fun and consistent with what others said for the most part! Pretty flat for the first 2 ish miles, and then picks up in steepness (which imo, was the most fun of the trail). There are lots of waterfalls and beautiful riverbeds, so they felt like nice treats before reaching Rachel Lake :] One thing to note is that around the 1.5-2 mile point (we were hiking for about 50 minutes into), there is a subtle fork in the road, where the correct path is the *left* path, and the right path leads into a dead end. We, unfortunately, did not see the *left* path, and took the right, which was full of fallen down trees and sharp branches that was easy to get hurt on. This path felt intuitively not like the actual trail, so be wary of this. Anyway, Rachel Lake was quite nice! Though the sky was a bit cloudy, there were nice moments where the lake was blue and gem green :] All in all, definitely a fun trail, and the lake is a wonderful view. Be careful on the way down!

Chain Lakes Loop	balkey	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Intermittent snow - not hard to cross	Even though it was overcast with intermittent showers, this hike is a must do. We went clockwise, starting from artist point. I’d recommend going counter-clockwise because coming up the goose trail at the end was rough. We made it of course but the steep steps weren’t the best way to end the hike. The trail is super dog friendly and came across a shrieking marmot that perked his ears. Loved the hike.

Colchuck Lake	egorup04	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	First time at Colchuck Lake did NOT disappoint. It's truly amazing. I see why it's such a popular hike and entry to the highly coveted Enchantment zone. We arrived to the parking area at 8:30am on a perfect weather Saturday to find the parking lot pretty much full and cars parked along the shoulder (legally) - we're guessing this was due to backpackers not necessarily due to day hikers arriving much earlier than us. We parked on the street and only had to walk about 7 minutes to the TH. The hike had so much to look at - streams, boulders, forest, peaks in the distance, and of course, the stunning lake at the end. We took 2 hours and 15 minutes to get to the top and about 1 hour and 45 minutes to get down. We passed a lot of groups going up on our way down. When we arrived back at the TH, the parking lot was insane. Cars double parking eachother - why do people do this? And, cars parked along the other side of the street (illegally). Anyways, amazing hike, get there early, have FUN! Remember, no dogs allowed on this hike!	Aug 11, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-11.5421722991
Wallace Falls State Park	Matt Coleman	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	As the other reports mentioned - a beautiful little hike for those who don’t have the time to commit to a full day (or even half a day for that matter). My hiking buddy and I wanted to add some mileage, so we ended up venturing down the old logging road to make the hike a total of 10 miles.  The only thing I noticed of note was that someone left human feces and toilet paper 15-20 feet off of the trail (went off a few feet to urinate). C’mon people...either bury your excrement or pack it out!!	Aug 11, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-11.5387991428
Olallie Lake via Pratt Lake Trail	Ken Powers	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	This is a fun trail with a consistent ascent and elevation gain of 2375 feet over the course of the 4.3 miles to Olallie Lake. There is a 1000 foot elevation change in the first mile and a half. The return trip puts the overall distance at 8.6 miles. One thing to note, however, is that the boot trail required for the Olallie Lake loop is not marked if you are traveling counter-clockwise and you may find yourself trekking all the way to Pratt Lake instead of looping around Olallie Lake. Also, the Talapus trail cutoff can be difficult to find in order to complete the loop and head back to the Pratt Lake Trailhead and parking lot. Luckily, the AllTrails app and GPS helped me find my way.	Aug 11, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-11.4471052649
Melakwa Lake	Homegirl	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Completed this beautiful hike this morning with a couple friends and two furry ones.  We set out at 7 am - 8:50 Lake Melakwa - 10:30 back at the lot.  My phone clocked 9.5 miles total, 3.5 hours total only because we didn't hang out at the lake long.  The mosquitoes were there, not full-on assault, but still annoying - hey, this is nature.  We didn't encounter another soul until we headed back down the trail and then there was group after group heading up.  I'd love to do this again on a clear day, as you can tell from the photos it was cloudy and sprinkled some. There was plenty to look at the whole way up: waterfalls, river, lake, valleys, berries, and pretty wild flowers.  Two thumbs up!  You want to do this hike.

Margaret's Way	Meg - B	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Great hike! Arrived at trailhead around 8:30 and only 2 other cars in the lot (the porta potty was also clean). The lookouts are the best part - so make sure to follow the signs.

Colchuck Lake	Chewie616	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	I went here for a day hike on 8/11/18. My friend and I drove from Seattle starting at 5:30 AM and made it up to the parking lot by 8:30 AM. We didn’t even get to park in the parking lot because it was so crowded. A lot of people started to create their own parking spots later in the day, and boxed other cars in. So, I am totally happy that I didn’t park in the lot!! I just parked on the LEGAL side of the road-I would recommend this. My friend and I are in fairly good shape as we both play soccer and run 3-4 times a week, so we made it up in 2 hours and 15 minutes. This included breaks and picture taking. The last 30-40 min of the hike are a bunch of rocky switch backs, and that part of the trail I would consider “hard”. Every other part of the trail is moderate. We sat by the lake for 45-60 min and ate lunch sitting next to the super turquoise lake. It was a beauuuuutiful day. It reached a high of about 75ish, but the trail is well shaded and we both hiked in shorts and a T-shirt. The only super exposed part of the hike is when you get to rest at Colchuck, but even then you can find a spot to rest in the shade! As for footwear, we are lucky enough to have nice hiking shoes and our feet were totally fine on the rocky terrain. The trail is doable with tennis shoes...I just wouldn’t recommend it since it’s a long hike (4 hours for us total). There were 0 bugs out, and I think we were really lucky about this as I heard this trail could get buggy. I will definitely do it again.

Barlow Point	tigersfa8	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Hike Summary: Short hike but constant uphill. Trail has more of a natural path with not a lot of footprints, which was more scenic vs very popular hikes which have wider and very discernable pathways. Cloudy and misty day, therefore there was no view visible at the top. At the top, there isn't a lot of space for any real camping or comfortable place to setup for a quick lunch. For the amount of time it took to drive out here, I didn't find this hike very enjoyable because the round trip was very short. This is a beginners hike if you take it slowly (the slope adds a certain degree of difficulty).	Aug 11, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-13.6416876992

Kelly Butte	Jille123	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	This is becoming my favorite Washington hike due to the location, distance and beauty found during the entirety of the hike. I went in Saturday as the clouds and rain started coming in. Hit the trail head around 11:00. Partly cloudy going up, but with peaks of blue. As I got to the top it was cloudy and foggy. No views this time. Started to sprinkle so headed down after I ate my lunch. Absolutely love this hike.	Aug 11, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-12.9972148965
Headlee Pass and Vesper Lake	Mary Maggee	Minor obstacles posing few problems	Road rough but passable	No bugs	Intermittent snow - not hard to cross	This hike is incredibly beautiful but also difficult, not for a novice or intermediate hiker. I would not come do this alone especially in the weather conditions we had which were rainy and misty, making visibility difficult when trying to figure out how to get to Headlee Pass when in Wirtz Basin. 	Aug 11, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-12.0318816441
Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) Section J - Snoqualmie Pass to Stevens Pass	Wallingford Wanderer	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	We hiked the PCT Section J from Stevens Pass to Snoqualmie Pass over 8 days / 7 nights from August 4 to 11. This was a family hike: mom and dad, plus two kids, ages 11 and 9 (who are seasoned hikers and backpackers with several years of mountain mileage under their belts). This was the first time any of us had done the entire segment, although we had completed a couple of stretches of section J on other hikes over the last few years so had some familiarity with the trail. Overall, it was an amazing experience! Day 1: Stevens Pass to Mig Lake. We were dropped off at the trailhead and got started at around 10:00. The weather was perfect, blue skies and in the 70s. We were pretty heavy at that point, with 8 days of supplies spread across our 4 packs, so we didn’t want to overdo it on day 1. We got to Mig Lake at 2:00, and grabbed a great campsite right on the lake. My GPS app (All Trails) was at 7 miles at Mig. The 9-year old caught his first trout of the trip later that evening, a nice 12-inch rainbow, which we promptly released. It was a great start to the journey. Day 2: Mig Lake to Deception Lakes.  We got started at 8:30. There are two climbs to get up and over Trap Pass, each with elevation gains of around 800 feet. After the descent down from Trap Pass, we stopped off at Glacier Lake for lunch. We camped at Glacier for a couple nights last year, so were familiar with the surroundings. It was good to recharge before continuing in the afternoon up and over Pieper Pass, a 1000 climb. The final approach into the Deception Lakes after a break at the top of Pieper went quickly, and we arrived at 4:30 at the 18 mile mark. Day 3: Deception Lakes to Deep Lake. This was one of our 3 ‘tough days’. The first 6 miles actually ended up being pretty easy, mostly flat and downhill first to Deception Pass, and then another 2 miles of slight downhill to the infamous ‘Hazardous Creek Crossing’ as indicated by the sign on the PCT at Deception Pass. The crossing ended up being far easier than expected. We were prepared to ford across in thigh deep water, but never even had to touch the water. There were two sections to cross, the first of which had a makeshift log bridge and the second of which was narrow enough to step over on a few exposed rocks. After eating lunch, we started up the long climb to Cathedral Pass, which was about a 1500 foot elevation gain. The views of Cathedral Rock as you approach the pass were awesome, and the mile or so up on top of the pass was one of our favorite landscapes of the hike. After switch-backing down to Deep Lake, we found a nice campsite near a large flat rock protruding out into the lake. Arrival time was 5:00 and the GPS app was at 31 miles. Day 4: Deep Lake to Waptus River Bridge. After each of the 3 tough days, we planned an ‘easy day’ to recover our strength and take it easy. This was one of the easy days, only about 8 miles of downhill and flat trail from Deep Lake to Waptus River Bridge. After sleeping in, we had a lazy and relaxing morning. Off of our lake rock, the 9 year old caught a couple more trout, including a beautiful 10-inch rainbow. Lots of fish in that lake! We left camp at 10:00 and got to the Waptus River Bridge at 2:00, munching on trailside huckleberries along the way. The main campsites before the bridge were taken, so we ended up finding a great spot right on the rocky banks (ie, small pebbles that we leveled out for our tent) of the Waptus River about 500 feet downstream from the bridge. Total distance was 39 miles. Day 5: Waptus River Bridge to Lemah Meadows. This was the second tough day of the trip. Our wake-up call was 5:00, and although we tried to get an early start, after packing up for 4 people we didn’t get on the trail until 7:30. The climb up to Escondido Ridge is a 2500 foot elevation gain over about 6 miles. We were carrying around 8 liters of water total, which was a good thing because the creeks were mostly dried up. We had lunch up at the Cooper River crossing among the Escondido Tarns, and were able to resupply our water from the creek that feeds the small lake at the top. There was still a patch of snow left on the talus field below Summit Chief, so the kids had some fun making snowballs and sliding down the snow. After lunch, we descended down the southwest side of Escondido Ridge and arrived at one of the campsites about a quarter mile before you get to the Lemah Meadow Trail. This was a nice secluded campsite right on the creek. Total distance was 54 miles. Day 6: Lemah Meadows to Spectacle Lake. This was the shortest segment of the trip, only 5 miles. Again, we took it easy in the morning and left camp around 9:00. We opted to take the bypass trail in order to ford Lemah Creek at the ‘footlog crossing’, rather than on the PCT where the Lemah Creek Bridge is out, mainly to make it easier for the kids. We had heard from some through hikers that the main crossing had thigh deep water. The alternate crossing was no problem with at most knee deep water. I had hiked up to Spectacle Lake 1 month ago, and noticed that the 20 or so blowdowns on the trail through the burn section which I had had to climb over previously had all been cleared, so huge shout out to the recent trail maintenance crew! We got up to Spectacle Lake just before lunch at around 11:30 at the 59 mile mark. Almost all of the campsites were still vacant at that point, so we were able to set up our tent on the site at the very end of the little peninsula separating the two main parts of the lake. This was the top campsite of the trip, and very possibly the best campsite we’ve ever had! There was a 10-12 foot drop off into deep water in the channel between the two lake parts, so we jumped in several times. The water temperature was really pleasant. That night, we left the rainfly off and slept under the stars. Day 7: Spectacle Lake to Ridge Lake. This was the third of the 3 tough days, and ended up being the toughest day of the trip. We woke up early again and were on the trail by 7:30. We stocked up on water, having heard that the trek across Chikamin Ridge did not have any water sources available. Altogether, we departed Spectacle with 11 liters of water for the 4 of us. There are 2 climbs of around 800 feet from the Spectacle Lake TH up to Chikamin Ridge, with a descent down into the Park Lakes basin in between the climbs. Just before the saddle over to the Chikamin Ridge, there was a creek where we were able to replenish our water. The trek across the Chikamin Ridge over to Joe Lake is grueling and requires both mental and physical energy. The trail is very high up above the Gold Creek basin, often with 1000+ feet of very steep slope below the narrow trail. This would have been nerve-racking even without having kids to monitor! Additionally, the trail is constantly climbing or descending. There were probably another 3 uphill climbs of around 500 feet in elevation gain each during this section, along with corresponding descents. The Kendall Katwalk pales in comparison to this section of the trail. Although you really need to focus on the trail here, the views over the Gold Creek Valley, with Joe Lake and Alaska Lake in the distance, Huckleberry Mountain, the Four Brothers, and Chikamin Peak were all breathtaking! The 11-year old fearlessly led the way through this section. We finally got to Ridge Lake at 6:00 and found a nice campsite overlooking the lake. It was very crowded with a dozen or more tents around the small lake. Total distance was 72 miles at Ridge Lake. Day 8: Ridge Lake to Snoqualmie Pass. We slept in until 7:00, and awoke to a very light drizzle. It was refreshing to have some cooler, wetter weather after all of the hot 80 degree days over the previous week. We packed up and left by 9:30. The drizzle had stopped once we were out on the trail, but there was rolling fog drifting up from the Gold Creek Basin, which ultimately blocked our view from the Katwalk. As soon as we crossed over the saddle after the Katwalk, the views into Commonwealth Basin opened up and there were even a few patches of blue sky. The final 6 miles to the parking lot went quickly and we were done by 12:30. I had dropped off a car and gotten a ride back the Friday night before we left, so we were ready to head home as soon as we finished. Total distance, according to my GPS app, was 79 miles.  Final reflections: This was really an incredible adventure! I personally like the Alpine Lakes Wilderness Area more than almost any National Park due to the pristine, undeveloped, raw natural landscapes; the variety of lakes, creeks, rivers, mountains, vistas, meadows, flowers, wildlife; and the community of hikers and backpackers from all over the world who also are passing through to experience and absorb this amazing natural ‘unplugged’ wilderness. We will certainly be back for more!  	Aug 11, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-12.1793580341
Mount Washington	snowman360	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Wife and I did this as a training hike for the Enchantments. Definitely a great hike if you are going to be doing any sort of strenuous backpacking, trail running, or similar. Got to the parking lot about 10:30 on a Saturday morning; maybe a dozen or so cars already out there, but unknown if they were hiking Mt Washington since this parking connects to the John Wayne Trail. We saw less than 10 people on the trail total, mostly coming down as we made our way up.  Took us about 2 hours to summit with half-full backpacking packs. Lots of shade, but not necessary since it was cloudy. Loose rocks occasionally made going up difficult, but otherwise the trail is in really good condition. Was socked in at the summit; and then the weather really went south on us in a hurry. If you've never been in a thunderstorm while exposed on a mountain summit, it's pretty terrifying. Very strong winds, hard rain, loud thunder, poor visibility. Not a great situation to be in. We had to run to the trees for some cover, quickly thrown a bit of rain gear, and then proceeded to speed hike down the summit. The trail began forming a small creek on it since it was really the only drainage system off the summit, making the decent very slippery and water logged. We were able to get out of the storm and away from the winds after 30 minutes of hiking. Other than that, the hike was great! Perfect for training or just wanting to go on a hike with less crowds. Most people will get turned off by the distance/elevation gain. Oh, I also clocked the elevation gain at 3500 ft from the parking lot using my Garmin. Also on the way down, we somehow managed to gain another 400 ft (with 3500ft of elevation loss) putting the hike a total gain of about 4000ft. A little over 8 miles RT. 	Aug 11, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-12.3450541058
Rachel Lake	Ky Carter	Obstacles on trail:	    Trees down across trail,	    Muddy or wet trail.	Road suitable for all vehicles	We got to the trailhead around 9am and there were already a ton of cars in the parking lot. We made our way up fairly easily, although there were a couple spots where we lost the main trail and had to backtrack a bit once we realized it. There were a couple trees across the path that we had to climb over, as well as parts of the path that had water/mud. The last mile or so has a big chunk of the elevation gain and was pretty tough. The lake was beautiful, although it was pretty windy. It rained on our way back down which made the roots and rocks a bit slippery. Overall it was a fun and challenging time!

Sheep Lake to Sourdough Gap	BriSyts	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	My son, son-in-law-to-be, and I made a four-summit loop around Crystal Lake on Friday. Since first visiting Crystal Lake three years ago, I've wondered if it was possible to connect these summits in a loop. If you're comfortable with some Class 3 scrambling, off-trail hiking, and a few places with limited exposure, this is a great hike that can be done in less than 6 hours. We didn't need any extra climbing equipment (however, a map, GPS, and steri-pen to treat the water were essential). We started at the Sheep Lake/Sourdough Gap trailhead just on the other side of Chinook Pass on Hwy 410. It's an easy 2-mile hike on the Pacific Crest Trail to Sheep Lake, and when we arrived around 10 am on Friday morning less than half the dozen or so campsites were taken, so we chose a nice secluded site at the north end of the lake. Our goal was to tag four summits in a clockwise loop, starting with Chinook Peak. After setting up camp, we hiked northwest, up a dried creek bed then traversed south and west on the southern flank of Chinook for about a mile until we met up with the trail that goes straight from the PCT up to the low spot on the ridge between Chinook and Deadwood Peak (by the way, this is the trail to take if you're doing this loop in a day, versus staying overnight). From there we went right (north) and in about 40 minutes reached the Chinook summit. From there we headed west then northwest along the ridge toward Peak 6706, arriving about 40 minutes later. From that summit we continued along the ridge line following a boot path west and then north to the summit of Crystal Peak. By this time we had been climbing for about 3 hours and were almost out of water. It was extremely warm. So we backtracked from Crystal Peak to the low spot on the ridge between Crystal Peak and Peak 6706, and from there dropped down to Crystal Lake for a swim and a nap. Then we continued up the trail that connects to the PCT and Sourdough Gap. But about 10 meters before reaching the Gap, we took a boot path on the right that went west up to the summit of Peak 6708, arriving in about 30 minutes. This was probably our favorite summit of the day. The peak looks impossible from every angle, but it's an easy walk up (maybe class 2 scramble) to the top. However, it's pretty exposed along the summit ridge line, so care should be taken. From there we retraced our steps back down to the PCT and Sourdough Gap, then finished our loop back to our campsite at Sheep Lake. My GPS said 9 miles and about 5800 ft of elevation gain for the day.	Aug 11, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-11.8109250931
Deception Pass	Smashingley	Obstacles on trail:	    Trees down across trail,	    Muddy or wet trail,	    Overgrown in places.	Spent an amazing weekend backpacking to Marmot Lake for two nights with a day trip to Jade Lake. Pictures of the stunningly turquoise Jade brought us out on this trail, but very few mentioned how absolutely gorgeous the entire trip is! From the Tucquala Meadows trail head to Jade Lake our Gaia app clocked us at 13 miles (26 round trip) and every single mile was unbelievably beautiful. The meadows and forests were so lush and full of wildflowers and butterflies that it seemed almost tropical, and every lake we passed was crystal clear, each a different shade of blue-green. The rugged peaks with their late-season snow patches were the only thing that reminded us that we were still in the Cascades. The eye candy definitely made up for how hard this hike was for a couple of beginner backpackers! - The trip up to Marmot took us 7 hours, thanks to many stops for photos and a stall to wait out a sudden downpour. It was a long 12 miles with heavy packs on, but no section was technically difficult on its own. From our campsite on Marmot to Jade Lake was just over a mile, but took us almost 2 hours to complete with day packs. The scramble up the avalanche chute at the end of Marmot Lake was a bit tricky, but not too bad with some well placed feet. (In the middle of the rocky slope there is a small island of trees that is visible from the bottom at Marmot Lake. Cairns will lead you around either side of the trees, but I definitely recommend staying to climber's right for an easier climb up and down. After the group of trees, cairns lead back to the left where a trail appears.) Our trip back from Marmot to the trail head took us 5 hours, and thankfully there is a bit more downhill than up on the way back. - The weather forecast called for a small window of scattered showers and mild sunshine for the rest of the trip. What we actually got was a downpour with howling winds that lasted all afternoon and on to the next morning, passing mist and sunny patches, and then sweltering heat and thick wildfire smoke on the way back. Be prepared for quickly changing and severe mountain weather, despite what the forecast says. And sadly, probably smoke for the rest of the wildfire season. - The mosquitos were the worst I have ever seen - all along the trail, but especially at Marmot Lake where we were constantly surrounded by swarms. Even pre-treating our clothes in permethrin, wearing head nets and using a combo of deet, picaridin and lemon-eucalyptus, we all ended up with quite a few bites. I rarely get mosquito bites and when I do I have very mild reactions, but these ones must be different because I ended up with severe localized swelling and pain that gave way to bruising. It was still worth the trip up, but definitely come prepared! - As far as bugs go, the mosquitos were the worst, but be aware that there were several wasps nests along the way. When the forest opens up right at the end of Marmot Lake a log that must be crossed to get over the trail has a nest in it, and myself and several other hikers were stung stepping over it. There is also a nest in a tree along the avalanche chute that heads up to Jade.  - Wildlife was incredible. There were a huge variety of wildflowers blooming and they were swarming with all kinds of butterflies. Salmonberries and blueberries were ripe and abundant. We saw a lot of deer footprints and a few cougar prints. Really enjoyed seeing a couple of sooty grouse, an adorable marten and of course, dozens of pika.  - One other thing I didn't see mentioned in any other reports is that there are actually pit toilets at Hyas, Marmot and Jade lakes. They are open air and clearly signed.  We will definitely be back next year, hopefully in better shape, when we plan to camp at Jade or the also beautiful No Name and attempt to make it up to Pea Soup as well.   	Aug 11, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-15.8602276042
Lake Ethel	Mia M	Minor obstacles posing few problems	Road rough but passable	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	Went out with a group of 6 for an overnight. Trailhead was pretty easy to find, just follow the signs. A higher clearance vehicle was helpful (Forester), there was a small water crossing and one enormous pothole that couldn't really be navigated around. The trail immediately climbs upward, and you continue upward for about 4 miles. We counted 69 downed trees that we had to climb over on the way to Ethel, although most were fairly small. As others have said, the clear cut section was very windy to cross. We set up camp at Lake Ethel (several sites and a pit toilet) and day hiked to Julius and Loch Eileen, which added about another 1500 feet of elevation gain for the round trip of 7 miles. It was cold and windy in the evening, but we were mainly protected by the rain shadow from the storm that seemed to be hitting all of the area around us. By morning the wind had died down, so bugs became a problem at breakfast. We only saw a few other parties between the 2 days. All in all, a pretty but challenging hike that delivered on the solitude.

Tahoma Creek Suspension Bridge - Emerald Ridge Loop	huckerbd	Minor obstacles posing few problems	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	My daughter and I chose to try to find the Tahoma Suspension Bridge.  We were coming from Seattle and had seen the forecast was calling for rain all day so we took our time packing and getting on the road.  It rained quite a bit of the way to the Westside road, but then once we parked it stopped.  Most of the hike in was quite comfortable with cloudy skies and cooler temps at 55 degrees which I'm sure kept the bugs at bay because we never encountered a single flying insect.   Getting there:  drive down the road until you can't go any farther, park and start walking.  We found the first opening in the woods to our right and ventured into there without any idea if it was the trail or not.  There was a sign saying it was an unmaintained trail.  Unfortunately, someone thought it was an open area bathroom and left toilet tissue by a tree.  First, don't leave anything behind and second of all if you are the one who did this, you use wayyy to much toilet tissue! We walked along side the "creek" (more like a river) until we ran out of land to traverse.  We started scrambling uphill to our left for about a quarter mile and found a decent trail which led us to a juncture with a sign pointing left and listing three other trails.  We were a little confused, so we veered right instead and the bridge was right around the corner. This is a one person bridge, please respect that as I'm sure it was not easy to build.  The bridge undulates up and down and left and right as you cross it so it feels a little like a carnival fun house, but with cables to hang onto.   Another form of respect to the persons who risked their lives to build this bridge is to treat it as a crossing and not as a fun house ride.  You'll get enough of a thrill just crossing it.  You don't need to bring on more wear and tear by jumping up and down and trying to deliberately swing side to side.  It's a natural high all by itself.

Talapus and Olallie Lakes	RajatChamria	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	No bugs	Snow free	We hiked the Talapus and Olallie lake on a Saturday Morning 11 AM. The last 2-3 miles road is unpaved. The parking lot cannot fit more than 15 cars, so if you reach late, you can park on one side of the road. We found a parking withing 1500 ft of the parking lot.  The hike is very nice. All the time you are walking among supertall trees so there is no chance of getting burnt in the sun, even on a warm day. We reached to Talapus lake in just 45 minutes (with just a couple of water breaks) and Then Olallie was just another 1.2 miles from there.  The trail gradually climbs all the way to the Olallie lake. There wasn't any stretch which I recall as flat or even up-down-up. It just climbs and climbs and climbs, but not steep at all.  Talapus wasn't still at all, so we didn't see any reflections. But Olallie being at a higher elevation, was decently still. But there are no good structures/mountains around it to see a reflection of. We took a long walk along the lake to find a spot to sit by the lake, and finally managed to walk through some bushes to reach at a tree log. We almost covered half of the lake while walking along its shores.  Beautiful hike. Beautiful day. Views - Average. Only if you go really early in the morning, you may see reflections in the lake. 	Aug 11, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-13.9764310430
Hannegan Pass and Peak	Ambrose Zhi	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Hiked to Hannegan Pass on Saturday and spent the evening at a nice campsite 15 mins away from the peak. There are some good campsites on the trail that leads to Hannegan peak, and they are not marked on the map. It was foggy and misty up there the entire Saturday, and it began pouring later in the evening. But overall it was still a good hike up there. Some salmon berries and huckleberries were ready too. Ran into a big group of WTA BCRT crew on the trail, and they were doing some great work on the trail! 	Aug 11, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-13.7470119492
Mount Walker	carlfarbman	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Trail condition is fantastic and clear of obstacles. We went on a cloudy day so we didn’t have any views. However this trail still looks pretty cool in the fog. There is no bathroom at the trailhead but I think there may be one at the second peak/view point (didn’t verify). As for the trail grade, it is steep but it stays pretty consistent. Very few flat spots to level out- its pretty much up the whole way.	Aug 11, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-13.4510782468
Section Line Trail	BikesOnWater	Obstacles on trail:	    Trees down across trail.	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Parked at the East Sunset Way Trailhead parking lot just off I-90 in Issaquah at 9 AM. No restrooms are available at the trailhead. There are two trails leading east and up from the lot, with no signs indicating which went where. Picked the southern trail and climbed. A few hundred feet up the trail encountered a clearing and an unsigned 3 way fork in the trail, and continued straight. Wandered further, decided to head south to Poo Poo Point along the trail marked #8, #7, #6 and #5 in Park Pointe. This section was pleasantly wooded, with the occasional hiker and trail runner encounters. Road noise from I-90 was present from the start, but soon diminished. Took the dead-end side trip at marker #7 and encountered some branches over the trail. I'm guessing that in years past there was a bit of a view here, but the trees have since grown to block it. Upon reaching marker #5 (High School Trail), the number of hiker and runners encountered increased. This trail is a former road, and today was being used as part of a couple of trail running races. However, no competitors were on the course while I was there. Some of the streams still had running water, which made for a pleasant environment. Continuing up High School Trail it eventually came to a cleared corridor and the trail split. I continued on the Poo Poo Point Trail. Sections of this trail were pretty steep, with a bit of loose rubble. Even though the temperature was in the low 70's with a very slight breeze I found myself sweating heavily and bemoaned not having brought my small battery powered fan. After climbing for quite a while the trail flattened out a bit and then descended quite steeply. With all the loose rocks and dusty soil it could be pretty treacherous. Eventually, it flattened out and ended up on another trail/road that lead eventually to the vault toilets and parking lot at Poo Poo Point. Poo Poo Point itself has quite a lot of astroturf covering the ground, primarily for the benefit of the hang gliders who take off and land here. It also benefits all the hikers who take in the gorgeous views of Squak Mountain, Issaquah, Bellevue and Lake Sammamish. There are a couple of picnic tables, too, if you don't want to sit on the artificial grass. After a short rest I continued down the gravel road to check out the views from the south side through the logged-out section of the forest - and they were also spectacular. I returned to the parking lot and retraced my steps along Poo Poo Point Trail to the fork, taking the West Tiger RR Grade Trail. This trail is the definition of the road less traveled. I encountered absolutely no one on this trail. In fact, it appeared that perhaps no one had been on this trail for days with all the growth in the more exposed sections. I was surprised to see much less dust in this area as well, given the lack of rainfall this season. Some sections at stream crossings were steep, and there were a few downed trees that one could duck under or climb over. In general, however, the trail kept mostly level. During this time the forecast rain and thunderstorm began. However, with the protection from the trees it was of little concern. Upon reaching the intersection with the Section Line Trail I decided to head down. This part of the trail is marked as unmaintained, and it is likely for liability concerns. I found it extremely steep, with extremely loose rubble. After slipping dozens of times I finally fell, skinning my arm and tearing the strap from my cheap knapsack. Enlisting the help of a handy stick for support I more slowly made my way down to the maintained section of the trail without further incident. Note: one of the race courses was up this trail, which would be more manageable for most people. The rain continued in earnest at this time, but the canopy worked well to keep off the majority of it. I returned along High School Trail and this time went to its end near the high school, and the rain stopped. Continuing north on the Rainier Trail Extension the sun came out. From the Issaquah Sportsmens Club and shooting range sounds of gunfire were prevalent. There were lots of juicy, ripe blackberries along the trail, too.

Pete Lake	Wanderer 43	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Very nice HIGH usage trail. Lol... Lots of people staying at the lake. Get there on a Thursday and its not as bad.   The lake is beautiful and you'll see why so many enjoy it. Mosquitoes were a constant annoyance on the trail but not bad at all at the lake. We made it to the lake around 1300 in the middle of a short rain storm. Didnt get to see the full range of peaks due to cloud cover. No bad stream crossings out of the 5 or 6 we crossed. Good places to wet the handkerchief on a hot day. 	Aug 11, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-13.8993341859
Tuck and Robin Lakes	behike	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	No bugs	Snow free	Did an overnight on Saturday. It was cloudy with scattered showers when I got to Robin lakes. No sunshine....no problem! It was pretty windy... no mosquitoes.. yeah!!! Mountain goats the next morning! They are pretty friendly....just don’t get too close!  A few observations.. The road to trailhead is in good condition ( for a forest road.. just go slow on a few rough spots)  From TH to Tuck.. pretty easy to follow. The last mile or so before Tuck was steep.. take your time! From Tuck to Robin lakes... follow the carins and be ready for a few scrambles( I personally found the hiking poles to be useful going up or down) ...hang in there and eventually you will reached Robin lakes! I found my site overlooking the lower Robin on the ridge between the two lakes. Going down... follow the carins. I was a little confused when I reached Tuck, I was having a hard time looking for the main trail back to the Hyas and TH due to too many social trails and people actually setting up camps on the “trails”?? So I just asked and poked around and found the main trail!! It was not an easy one for me but start early and give yourself plenty of time and you will not regret doing it. Make sure you need.. NW pass, register at TH for overnight, leave no trace... and pee on the rocks:)... not on vegetation) the goats will find it!!  Have fun!

Barclay Lake	jamestm	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	It is a four mile hike up the Forest Road to this trailhead.  Plenty of bumps and potholes, but our minivan was able to make it without a problem.  The parking lot is small, so you'll likely park on the approach to the lot.  This hike is a delight with kids: pretty low elevation gain, low mileage, and a clear straight shot to the lake. The water level is really low right now, so there is more "beach" to explore.  I went "off trail" to get to the large boulder at the west end of the trail: MISTAKE!  On one of the paths through the brushes, you will stumble upon angry, angry wasps that leave you swollen.  Ouch! We had a very sunny and breezy hour at the lake before the rain hit.  But, the forest coverage helped in keeping us dry.  Wonderful trip, ended with a stop at the annual Index Art Fair.

Tolmie Peak Lookout - Eunice Lake	MyTwinLens	Trail in good condition	Road recommended for high clearance only	No bugs	Snow free	The trail head is after 40 minutes of driving on rough gravel speed bump style road. It feels like your wrecking your suspension. Just borrow a friends truck to get here. I drove a Honda CR-V and wished I had a truck. The trail starts at MOWICH lake which is beautiful. No real parking lot at the trail marker so everyone is just off to the side. I started the trail at 4:20 and by 4:45 it was raining buckets. I passed a lot of groups coming back and they said there was no visibility at tolmie peak so I decided to aim for Eunice lake. Made it there but only saw 5ft of the lake. Saw two deer and heard some birds but didn’t see any other animals. I definitely think I will come back on an absolutely cloud free day to do this again and give myself more daylight hours.

Kendall Katwalk	audg86	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Beautiful trail. We started about 7:45 with plenty of parking left. We set off intending to do an overnight at Ridge Lake. The trail was very nice, gradual incline most of the way. Lots of trail runners here, quite a few section hikers coming SOBO from Stevens, and a few thru-hikers. I’m generally afraid of heights so I was a bit nervous for the Katwalk, but it was plenty wide and very cool to see. On the far side of the Katwalk the weather changed. Very windy and rainy. Bugs weren’t bad at the lake but it was probably the weather. Talked to a few others who said it had been raining by the lakes all day. Hung out for a while but ultimately decided to pack back out. Made for a 15-mile day.	Aug 11, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-12.4682743993
Bead Lake	Lionessmoon	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	The directions say to drive to the end of the road for the trail head.  The road doesn’t really end there but turns from gravel to dirt. The parking is on the right and easy to find. There is a trail head sign in the parking lot and another at the roadside. We went to look at the roadside sign and somehow missed the actual trail to the left of it going into the woods. We walked a little ways up the dirt road before realizing it wasn’t quite right and backtracking.   The trail can be a little narrow in places, but a really nice little path along the lake.  You spend most of the time up the slope from the lake and get down to water level where streams (some dry) have created valleys.  In case you are hoping for a wilderness lake it’s good to know that there are houses on the end that you start from, and a boat launch. There wasn’t noise or lights from them at the end we camped on.  Also very few people on the trail   We went around 1pm and didn’t see anyone until we set up camp   Then we saw only 4 people.  On the way out we saw someone else camping but most sites were empty.     We hiked almost to the other end, and it doesn’t apparently dead end like the directions say. It meets up with a dirt road.  We met some mountain bikers who came in from that direction and said the trail was hard to find from there.   We didn’t see any big wildlife, but did see moose footprints, a grouse and heard ravens.  It was beautiful, peaceful, and the lake was a great temperature for swimming.  The biggest downside was the wasps and hornets.  They were thick around all the wooded camp areas. They don’t care about DEET and I got stung.  I had to zip my digs into the tent to keep them from getting stung   Some of the low brush is starting to turn autumn orange. Very pretty hike!

Mount McCausland	rawlint	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	We arrived at the trailhead at about 9:30am and the lot was 3/4 full.  Be aware there is no privy.  What a glorious day it turned out to be.  We were happily surprised at how nice the weather was despite the forecast for thunderstorms.  We had some very light ran along the trail and it was cloudy but that made it cool and enjoyable.  Because of the weather is seemed to keep the bugs laying down, no bites for us.  We went to the lake first and as we enjoyed our lunch the clouds started to lift and once we started the climb to the McClausland peak the views down to the lake below and in the distant were spectacular.  This is now one of my favorite somewhat easy hikes in Central Washington.  The elevation gain is mostly gradual until you start the steep climb to the peak.  That's where it got a bit dicey.  I made it half way up, high enough for those views, while other members of my group went all the way up.  While they enjoyed the challenge because of the cloud cover on the other side of the mountain they didn't have any views.  It was sunny and cool hike back down to the cars.  That was at 1:30pm and the lot was full with cars parked on the dirt road adjacent to the trailhead parking.

Kennedy Creek Natural Area Preserve	jonesal00	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Logging road was great, in between the thunderstorms, mostly flat.

Twin Sisters Lakes	themaddhiker	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Road is gravel and rough (9.5miles) getting to Deep Creek TH, but doable. There were only a few cars at TH parking lot, 1 Horse trailer. There is a Wilderness Permit to fill out there (free) and parking is free with a NWFP. Hike up to the lakes was a short 2 mile steady grade thru trees, very pleasant. The trail comes out to Little Sister Lake and is very pretty and quite a few places to camp. We chose to hike the 1/2 mile to Big Sister lake and camp there. We had the lake pretty much to ourselves. The scenery is beautiful and access to the lake is very easy, many rocks to sit on at shore and soak your feet or go for a swim. We set up camp and left our packs and hiked up to Tumac Mountain. The hike there is pretty moderately easy most the way, the accent up will make you sweat a little but worth the work for the views at the top. You could camp at the top if you packed plenty of water with you. I'd bet it gets windy tho. Looks like there used to be a fire lookout, only foundation blocks now. You have almost 360* views, minus some trees. It was a little hazy when we were there so couldn't see what you probably could on a clear day. I'd definitely hike up again on a clear day just to see what I missed. The next morning we packed up and decided to hike over to Snow Lake to check it out. It was a couple mile backtrack but didn't mind it, pretty easy hike over. Very pretty lake again with a couple camp grounds, no one there. We did see many folks hiking the PCT (which you use to get to snow lake), but they were just passing by. We than made the hike out. This area is usually very Buggy, we sprayed bug spray before coming up on first day. Didn't even use bug spray next day, which probably should of, but it wasn't too bad. I came home with maybe 5 bug bites, so considering the area, it wasn't that bad. Over all Twin Sisters Lakes was a great place to either hang for the day or use for base camp and hike around. 	Aug 11, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-12.1673197944
Dirty Harry's Balcony via the Birdhouse Trail	Denzy88	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Arrived at the trailhead around 0800.  I thought we got a late start for a Saturday, but with the weather forecast calling for T-Storms and rain, we were only the second car in the lot.  Got off the main trail and ended up at the base of Overhaul (I think).  So we went around and got back up to the main birdhouse trail, so only a minor detour.  After about an hour and a half we made it to the fork where there are a couple of cairns, to the left is the Peak and to the right is the Balcony.  Take a right and in a short distance you will have another fork, stay right until you get to the Balcony,  great views even on an overcast day like today.  The trail going straight is the connector trail to Putrid Pete's Peak.  Gotta do this soon. We then returned back to the main trail and headed up to the peak.  Good workout as elevation begins to change quickly, similar to Mt Washington.  About a half mile from the peak, the trail gets very brushy and today was very wet from the moisture.  My wife decided she was done swatting weeds and branches from her face.  I decided to push forward for another 5 minutes to the peak.  Unfortunately today there was no view because of the clouds.  I should have been able to see upper and lower granite lakes.  Sounds like another trip up on a clear day. Caught back up to my wife about about 20 minutes later and the hike down was nice a cool with a nice breeze.  This is a good hike even on a hotter day because there is plenty of shade and plenty of great views with all the balcony views.  Spent just under 5 hours total.  Next time I would like to visit the museum to see the old truck, but my wife did not want to do anymore bushwhacking today.  Just missed the rain and saw lots of rock climbers on the way down. This is a good hike to prepare for steeper hikes like Mailbox Peak and McClellan Butte.   Be safe and Happy Hiking!

Ruby Mountain	Keith T	Obstacles on trail:	    Trees down across trail,	    Overgrown in places.	Road suitable for all vehicles	Phew this was tough. I made it tougher on myself by doing Sourdough Mountain the day before. Sadly I didn't complete the hike - I got to about 6700 feet but didn't want to endure the cold, wet wind with darker clouds coming in. The views were good but much of it was hidden behind the clouds. On the bright side, the smoke from the previous day had cleared out and it was cooler too. Recent bear poop on the trail spooked me a bit, especially after not seeing any humans for hours. But then I bumped into a group on their way down and later ran into a couple groups on their way up. The trail was much easier to follow than I expected, though it was getting more difficult towards the top. Also, I didn't see any running water after the trail branched off. There was a stagnant lake but that's all I saw.	Aug 11, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-11.4556415851

Rattlesnake Mountain	levy.russ@gmail.com	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Rattlesnake Mountain via Snoqualmie Point Park (exit 27) trailhead is a way to enjoy hiking Rattlesnake Mountain without the crowds found at the Rattlesnake Lake trail head.  The trail was in good shape and the elevation gain is moderate, making it a trail for most hikers.  The first mile climbs steadily through a forested area with a nice creek along the way.  The next 1/2 mile or so rises through an area that was logged years ago.  This section of trail is in need of some brushing as the vegetation is quite high and narrows the trail but not overtaking it.  At 2 miles is the spur trail to Stans overlook. The weather was cloudy so views were limited.  Leaving the junction and several switchback later, the trail is back in a forested area that surrounds the trail all the way to Grand Prospect view point (4 Miles).  Views of North Bend and Mt Si are among some of the features from the view point that can be enjoyed from the two benches that are there. The wild flowers were in full bloom.  Leaving Grand Prospect the trail meanders up the ridge line to East Peak, the turn around point for the hike at approximately the 6 mile point.  A big surprise was all the logging that has been done this past year along the trail.  What was previously a forested hike now is a hike with expansive views through an area recently logged.  At East Peak there are two benches one with views looking down to North Bend and beyond.  There was bear scat along this section of the trail but no bears were observed.  East Peak is a good turn around point if you dont have a car parked at Rattlesnake lake or other means to take one back to Snoqualmie Point Park.  If you do, it is a little over 4 miles to the lake, all down hill.

Ebey's Landing	Muledeer	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	With the threat of thunderstorms and rain in the mtns, we decided a beach hike would be the best choice. This is always a good hike and today was perfect, cloudy, cool temps and a slight breeze. We welcomed it! If you have not been here for awhile, there are some welcome changes. A new loop trail, the Pratt Loop, which loops thru the forest before meeting the Bluff trail and gives you an additional 1.3 miles of trail. And speaking of new, the old rusty sanican is gone and there is a brand new loo. We elected to do the loop and the Bluff first, then the beachwalk. Check out the huge thatch ant nests in the woods!  The Bluff trail is moderately steep and the tread is sandy. Lots of late flowers, white and pink catchfly, sand verbena, salsify and gumweed. The seagulls must be molting, there were feathers everywhere.  We walked along the beach for awhile, then climbed over the driftwood and followed the trail by Peregos Lagoon. That was very interesting today, the water was down and there were little shorebirds feeding in the rocks. Really interesting to a couple of plant nerds, the pickleweed that grows on the edge of the salty lagoon had very tiny yellow flowers! If you're not in a hurry, it's amazing what you can see! Heading back up the hill, we could see the storm approaching from the west. Yay rain! 	Aug 11, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-11.0233217744
Moss Lake	dmk	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Arrived around 9:00 AM and despite being a Saturday, we were the only ones there.  Road directions are good, but once there the trail marking is poor.    From the parking area it is not clear which way to head.  We decided to go down the wide gravel road, to the rightish from the parking area.  We came to the creek with the removed culvert but easily crossed on wide/sturdy planks that are in place.  Past the culvert the trail(s) narrow somewhat but are in good condition.  A little while later the trail forks to two trails that are rather parallel to each other, with one being closer to Moss Lake and more scenic.  We went up one and back the other.  The short side-spur trail comes off the main trail/road, not too far from the parking area, and leads to the lake. But it is not clear if there is another trail to the lake - one with the Axelexia display - that we missed.  All-in-all an easy round trip of about 3 miles through some pretty under-story forest.  For some reason I was expecting a loop trail that goes    There is no such lake loop.  Just a few bugs and Ben's DEET did the trick.

Rattlesnake Ledge	Marymoocow	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Headed up a few minutes after 5am to catch the sunrise. Took almost exactly an hour to get to the top. We saw two other groups at the top but otherwise were alone on the way up. Heading down around 6:30, we passed several dozen headed up and I can only imagine it gets worse from there so, heading up before 6 is recommended if you'd like any solitude.

West Fork Methow River	WolverineWay	Obstacles on trail:	    Trees down across trail,	    Difficult stream crossing(s),	    Bridge out,	Preface: this is not your usual day hike. I have a strange inclination to go out scouting the trails that time forgot. I read trail reports with a five year gap in any information on them and think, "Well, I should go see what kind of shape it is in. If not me, than who?" Let's call it a research project for the benefit of the trail community, or "advanced scouting" (see also WTA's  ). I'm drawn to some of the more obscure trails you can find on a map of the Cascades - an unforgiving landscape without a well-trodden path. You can imagine what I find: huge downed trees, one upon another; thick, merciless brush; rocky, rain-battered trail that is difficult to follow, step upon, let alone make a good pace on. Patience is a valuable asset here, not to mention fitness, strong ankles, and stubborn shins (although I'm starting to consider bringing my soccer shin guards). I also enjoy a nice long through-hike (aka trail run) rather than doing loops, so I leave a shuttle bike for myself on the other end. Riding a road bike over Rainy Pass and Washington Pass to Mazama at the end of a 24 mile trail day is also non-trivial, but this is not a road bicycle organization, so I'll leave that part out of my report. This traverse covered multiple trail areas: one on the east side of the PCT, the PCT itself, and another trail on the west side of the crest. I had two different experiences on two long neglected trails. I will write about each of them independently for the determined and curious hikers out there (and hopefully a WTA crew leader or two). In the middle of it all is Mebee Pass which hosts a   abandoned fire lookout. I say "nearly" because John Scurlock and friends adopted it in 2013, clearing the East Creek trail and flying in building materials to restore its roof. I had high (but unreasonable) hopes that East Creek would be an easy descent because of this. I should have read Scurlock's description more carefully (see the NWHikers.net link below). Five years of nature doing her thing has not improved the situation. More detail on that below. The good news is the fire lookout is in fine shape. The latest photo hosted on Steph Abegg's climbing blog (also linked) shows the structure -- "the last known L-5 cab" -- from an airplane photo taken by John Scurlock on April 27, 2018. It says: "Uh oh, we seem to have a little issue.....adding some urgency to the next phase of restoration efforts." Well, I have good news for the friends of this fire lookout, and that is the shutters have been repaired! Somewhat miraculously, I can even tell you how. It makes for a real interesting twist in this story, in my opinion. Keep in mind that I saw not a single person on this trail in my entire 8 hour day. One other vehicle pulled in at the Methow trailhead while I was making breakfast. He gave me a scowl (probably for having a hippie VW van with my top popped) and I never saw him again. I saw no one on the PCT even, maybe due to a recent fire closure. Perhaps the detour signs got left up too long? Certainly no one was on the old East Creek trail, but when I popped out at that trailhead, there was a family taking a picnic on the back of their pickup. A very surprised man looked at me and asked "Where did you come from? Where's your car?" I explained my route and he informed me that he had done the EXACT SAME ROUTE in the other direction on Memorial Day Weekend of this same year. He did it as an overnight, probably camping somewhere near the pass. What's even more unbelievable is he also scrambled the 500' up a trail-less ridge to discover the fire lookout  . Then guess what he did? He found the tools stashed in the hut, and he fixed the shutters! What do you believe the odds are that I would meet the one man who did this same obscure thing as me, in reverse, only a few months apart, right at the trailhead? For his journey, he was dropped off on the west side by his wife. The creeks were much more treacherous then, and he was nearly sunk when reaching the Trout Creek crossing on the east side, facing waist deep raging water between him and reaching home (where I had only three rock hops to cross it). I guess these two intrepid souls were bound to meet each other at the East Creek TH! His name was Keith, I believe (I was somewhat delirious when I met him). On this particular day, he drove his wife and young daughter west from the Methow Valley where they live to escape the smoke. He probably chose this spot for its relative quiet on a busy summer weekend (when every pullout on Hwy 20 in the North Cascades is packed with shutter-clicking tourists and giant RVs cooling their engines off) or to reminisce on his difficult passage. Somehow, he was the only man I met on the trail this day, and he knew exactly what I went through to get there. Which leads me to the detailed trail descriptions: This trail is 8 miles of mellow river valley. It should be straight forward and easy to reach the PCT. It is only fairly described as such for 2.5 miles. Then, you reach Trout Creek where the bridge has been washed out for some time now. As I understand it, the locals fear this crossing in the spring. At this time, in a typical dry August, the lion has returned to cub status. It is easy to hop across several dry rocks. Unfortunately, the ease of travel ends here along with the trail maintenance. You will immediately be required to hop fallen trees, apparently from a 2003 burn (total may near 100). Then the brush starts. You can follow the trail well enough. It is just super slow going, like wrestling with quicksand or fist-fighting a jellyfish. If it were only the occasional patch, I would probably not make much mention of it. However, this goes on consistently for five miles. Would any reasonable person hike through this and back out again? I would not. The trail gains a bit of elevation at its very end, maybe 2-300', to join the PCT at Brush Creek. This section is mercifully more clear than near the Methow River itself. I stopped at the bridge over Brush Creek to filter water and refill my bottles. It appears plenty of through-hikers have camped here. Dear Methow Valley Locals: what can you do to restore this trail to its previous glory? The bed is in fine condition. It just needs some brushing and saw work. Harts Pass shouldn't be the only access point to the PCT from Mazama. This one is perfectly viable and should not be lost. Where this trail separates from the PCT was not clear to me. It may have been near the sign that marked 15 miles to Harts Pass and 15 miles to Rainy (10 to Cutthroat). If not for my AllTrails app where I previously loaded the route onto my phone, I may not have found it at all. I knew I shouldn't be crossing the Methow River, at which point I was at least a mile past the turnoff which followed the contour line in a more friendly fashion beneath Azurite Peak (the clouds had socked it in). Once I regained it from taking a B-line uphill from the river (thank goodness for low underbrush after previous trauma), the route was not hard to follow. It was not  , nor exceptionally even, but easy enough to follow for the 2000' of climbing required to reach Mebee Pass. There were also several good water sources. After the pass, which I scrambled up further to check the condition of the fire lookout (see above), the trail was again faint but easy to follow. I am now going to reverse my description of it, presuming readers would be coming from Hwy 20 and the East Creek TH, not Mebee Pass. After crossing Granite Creek (several feet deep in mid-August, I just waded across), the first few miles of East Creek trail are steep and rocky. It has a nice bench and apparently has been maintained all the way to first crossing of East Creek (2.5 miles?). The crossing uses a large fallen tree and regains the forested hillside. You will encounter trailwork from John Scurlock & Friends (see link) in the form of sawed trees, with new large trees fallen over these cleared ones. The trail is faint enough that it is possible to lose the trail in one of these hops, with an occasional flag to set you straight. I still relied on my GPS to keep me close to the track. This was all relatively simple leading up to the old mining relics around the 4 mile mark. Then, all bets are off. You will reach an avalanche path that obliterated any sign of the trail. There is not a trail anymore - there is just a preferred path, which means not wrestling through slide alder over your head. Believe me, I searched in desperation for these paths, as I had no energy left for making my own way. There was occasionally a pink flag and a few random cairns. I would recommend bringing your own flags and boosting these signs once you know   you're on the right path. This may be possible if you luck out on your trip out, and retrace your steps backwards and confidently mark it for the next person. Otherwise, please don't add to the confusion. The prescribed route actually crosses East Creek again after two slide paths, where I dropped a medium size log to use as a bridge next to an existing pink or yellow flag. Going this way, you'll sidehill again up the west side of the creek through some lush meadow with a trench for a trail hiding under the leaves (hard on the ankles). After that, the trail is relatively easy to follow, although you'll be hopping plenty of logs and scanning the forest for the correct route, especially when you cross a few more open meadows. I think reaching Mebee Pass to attain views of the Methow River Valley, Azurite Peak and other nearby monuments are a worthy objective, but we as a community need to do something about these super vague avalanche path crossings. It was discouraging enough to derail my momentum completely - however I had no choice but to find a way through, as I was nearly 20 miles into my day at this point. There was no turning back. I want to recommend this trail, but I cannot suggest venturing through this zone without plenty of energy, determination, and sense of direction (some technology may also help). It would also be nice to see the WTA focus some attention on some of these less popular trails to help distribute the load. Every other trail on Hwy 20 at this time of year is packed to the gills with cars. If we make these trails close-to-perfect for 100+ hikers per day and neglect the older trails, we're only contributing to the problem - concentrating everyone into the same area. Where will someone go to feel truly engaged in the wild, without fully cursing the Cascades for being inhumane and the land that time forgot?

Mount Daniel	Fighting Quaker	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were an annoyance	Intermittent snow - not hard to cross	The scramble up to the top of Daniel is virtually snow-free, no ice axe or traction required. Air quality in the alpine area around Daniel (anything above 5000 ft) is noticeably hazy and smokey, courtesy of wildfires. Bugs at Peggy's Pond were unpleasant but not unmanageable.  Cle Elum River Road is long and bumpy, but passable with any vehicle, since unbridged Scatter Creek is basically dry. The TH's privy is locked, and parking can be tricky (though we lucked out and snagged a primo spot).  The trail up to Cathedral Pass is well-graded and unremarkable. There is a brand-spanking new toilet at Squaw Lake, and there were a few families camped there. There's been some recent stock use, as evidenced by a decent amount of horse droppings, but otherwise my companion and I had no trouble getting to the junction with the trail to Peggy's Pond.  As the description suggests, the trail is mildly exposed, and has some rather annoying up-and-downs. We ran into a man who was struggling - possibly due to dehydration - and helped him to the best of our (limited) ability. After that bit of Good Samaritan-ism, we quickly found ourselves at the glorified tarn that is Peggy's Pond. It boasts a web of social trails and   privies, which seems a bit extravagant to my primitive sensibilities. The photo below shows the campsite we chose, perched in a large flat area next to a creek and small waterfall. We kept an eye on distant Daniel's summit, and with the cloud cover soon turning into surprisingly heavy rain we opted to wait until the next day to make our ascent. Luckily, the wind and rain kept the bugs at bay, and we largely survived bite-free. : As day two dawned, a friendly ranger wandered by to alert us about the fire ban and inquire as to our itinerary. As I talked with her, the clouds dispersed somewhat, and soon we started the long trek up to the summit ridge. There's a few ways to gain the SE summit ridge - featuring various amounts of steep scree, rock-hopping, and dirt - but they all converge around 7000 ft. From there, it's a standard ridge-line traverse to 7200 ft, at which point you can either cut right across a snowfield to a saddle south of Mt Daniels' East Peak or continue scrambling the ridge up to around 7600 ft, at which point it drops down to the same saddle. We opted to take the ridge, as did most of the other parties we observed that day: unsurprising, as the snowfield would be a bad place to take a fall. : There's a gnarly scree slope to traverse, but it's doable with a trekking pole, and after that it's mostly a matter of walking at varying levels of steepness to the summit pyramid. There's a single small snow patch, but it's hardly more than 20 feet across, and relatively flat. Between the wildfire haze and the persistent cloud cover, our views from the summit were minimal, and we did not linger long. As we descended, the smell of smoke grew stronger, and the haze increased noticeably, no doubt due to shifting winds. While it was a shame our views from the top weren't better, we had a peaceful camp, plenty of whiskey, and a strenuous (but not overly technical) summit as a reward.

The Enchantments	happyfuntimes	Obstacles on trail:	    .	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	A long, difficult hike but well worth the effort. Spectacular views at every turn! We left the Stuart Lake trailhead around 7 am and arrived at the Snow Lakes trailhead at 10 pm, so the entire hike took 15 hours including several stops for food and water filtration. There were very few bugs throughout. I recommend bringing poles, even if you don't normally use them, because of the over 7000 feet of elevation loss. I also recommend bringing a pair of gardening gloves for scrambling over boulders - the rocks can be quite sharp. Bring a water filter and a headlamp (we finished the hike in the dark) and a printed map. Even with the map and following the cairns we lost the trail at times. Stay safe and good luck! 	Aug 11, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-12.6522491579
Sherpani Peak	Adam_G	Minor obstacles posing few problems	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	My friend and I headed to a rarely scrambled peak called Sherpani. This is an off trail route requiring a fair amount of navigation and then some class 3, occasionally class 4 scrambling. The road to the Paddy-Go-Easy trail was in excellent condition. By the time we reached the trailhead around 9:30 am, there were already several cars parked there. We ascended the trail. The flowers had mostly died down, but there were ripened huckleberries, although most were not ripe. There also were scattered thimbleberries. We stopped around 5,800 feet where you run into the talus field to your north. We then turned left off trail. There is no bootpath to guide you. If you end up around 6,000 feet where the illegal fire ring is, you've gone to high, and you'll end up scrambling across the talus field. If you go too low, you'll be bushwhacking through the forest. If you skirt just to the bottom of the talus field, you can avoid the boulders and also the major brush. On the way there, there were ripe blueberries. We also found occasional boothpaths which we believe to be the old Paddy-Go-Easy trail which was substantially rerouted. We traversed in a northwesterly direction under the slope of the Paddy-Go-North peak and over to a very obvious large drainage which runs east. There, we found the obvious miner's trail that avoids the boulders and runs up the drainage in the forest. This passed a caved in mine. We then reached the pass which runs between Paddy-Go-North and Point 6564. From here, there were pretty nice views of the The Cradle. Your next goal is to attain the saddle between point 6564 and Sherpani. It seems logical to traverse around the side of the basins quite high to get there. This is not a good route  because it is rocky and slow going. We descended to the greenery and stayed low to pass over the east ridge of 6564. Once into the second basin, we ascended the obvious gully to our desired saddle. Prior to this point, it was just an off trail hike. It now became a scramble. Additionally, the finding the route became challenging. The ultimate goal is the east ridge of Sherpani. There was a vertical rock shelf running along there and a fairly flat boulder field below it. This boulder field terminates in a very obvious saddle along the east ridge of Sherpani. We went there, but realized after the fact that is not the best route. There was actually a bootpath at the saddle and even some cairns. But the route was a bit exposed with at least one challenging technical move where there were few handholds or footholds. It's best left for the more experienced. A bit closer to the peak on the ridge from the obvious saddle, there is another subtle sloped saddle. This should be your destination, not the obvious saddle. The most straightforward way to get there is to travel along the boulder field and just attain it directly. That route is a lot of loose dirt, loose rock, and slippery vegetation. It's not very steep, but steep enough that you may slip and bruise your ego. Another possibility is to jump onto the rock shelf. Although the rock shelf is essentially vertical at first near the saddle between Sherpani and 6564, it does look like you could scramble it if you travel a bit east. Some reports suggest that you can take that up. From below, it looked like it would either be straightforward or be fairly technical with quite a bit of exposure, and perhaps end up completely cliffed out. We did not explore that option. Once you make it to the proper entry point, the route to the summit is fairly straightforward. You travel an obvious path counterclockwise around the peak and then climb up into an obvious keyhole. This takes you to just below the summit rock. There is a wide platform there with a fair amount of exposure on your right but a nice rock wall to your left. You then can climb up a larger boulder and pretty much avoid the exposure by hugging the rock. This takes you to another nice platform. The final push is up onto a large coffin shaped rock which is the true summit. It's a complicated move to get up there, and pretty technical. We stood on our tiptoes, just enough to grab the summit register and signed it without truly submitting. Once we were on the summit, it started raining, so we headed down and put on our rain gear, which promptly stopped the rain. We made it back to the trailhead around 5:30 pm.

Mount Pilchuck	campfriend18	Trail in good condition	Road recommended for high clearance only	No bugs	Snow free	The weather was overcast and cool, some occasional light rain. It was misty and probably around 60 degrees. Kept the dust down on the road and trail, but was chillier than we expected. The road up has huge potholes, I don’t know how vehicles with less than my Forester’s 8” clearance make it without scraping. The parking lot was not even a quarter full when we got there at 9 am.  The trail is rough, big rocks the whole way and steep. Hiking boots needed unless you want bruised feet. With the misty, wet conditions there was a quiet beauty and the colors of the vegetation and rocks were amazing. Huckleberries and other berries just reaching ripeness along the trail. Cold mist blowing around at the top, visibility was poor, the lookout enclosure was a welcome place to stay warm and have a snack. We had to carry our little dog up the last stretch of boulders and up the ladder to the lookout. It was disappointing not to see the spectacular view this time but the conditions produced a different kind of experience that was just as rewarding.

Nice trail for a stroller walk, though it doesn't have much shade in the late morning/early afternoon.  (We had mixed sun/clouds/rain/wind.  That was fun too.)

By the time we reached the summit our hands were cold and the slight breeze prompted us to hike back to the beginning of the loop intersection for lunch. The forest and undergrowth are beautiful.

American Ridge	Silent Spring	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	This is a really nice and challenging trail.  Yes, it's dusty in some places and with loose ground cover, and overall the ascent is steep, yet the views are breathtaking. Lots of places to stop and rest if you get too winded or need to gain footing.  Sweet pine aromatherapy and some birdsong, but mostly really quiet with just a slight breeze. Elk tracks on the trail in places, too. Only hiked up to where the trail began to get too steep for my skill level (last picture) and then had lunch at the beautiful rocky outlook pictured before heading back.  About 3 hours of hiking total and at a brisk pace except with very cautious steps on the descent in places. 	Aug 11, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-11.5124605948

Bald Mountain via Ashland Lakes	George & Sally	Obstacles on trail:	    Trees down across trail,	    Overgrown in places.	Road recommended for high clearance only	This was a hike on a trail I had last hiked on in 1988, thirty years ago, the Bald Mtn. Ridge Trail that goes from Ashland Lakes to Bald Mtn./Cutthroat Lakes. I had first hiked to Bald Mtn. and Cutthroat Lakes in 1977 via the east trailhead in the Sultan Basin. This trailhead was from a spur road off the Williamson Creek Road. At that time the hike to Cutthroat Lakes was only 2.75 miles on the Bald Mtn. Trail. It is my understanding the Bald Mtn. Ridge Trail was built by a Boy Scout troop from the Lake City area of Seattle back in the 1970's. When Snohomish County PUD raised Culmback Dam and Spada Lake, the lower portion of the Williamson Creek Road was flooded. So when I did a backpack trip to Cutthroat Lakes in 1984, I had to take a different route to get to the trailhead. I drove the DNR 5000 Road off the Menzel Lake Road south of the City of Granite Falls. This was a 27 mile drive on a gravel road. Once the Walt Bailey Trail to Cutthroat Lakes was completed in 1990, DNR abandoned the Bald Mtn. Trail section from the Sultan Basin/Williamson Creek trailhead. In the 1990's DNR also gated off the 5000 Road at the Menzel Lake Road due to people who would drive up the road to dump garbage, appliances, old TV's and cars. Plus 4X4 trucks would drive through the fir tree plantations killing the trees and making deep ruts. When I turned off the Mtn. Loop Highway on to the FS 4020 Road, the big pot holes begin. This makes for a slow 5 mile drive to the Ashland Lakes trailhead parking lot. The 5 miles takes about 30 minutes. You want to have a high clearance vehicle for the 4020 and 4021 Roads. Only one car at the trailhead when I arrived. After getting my boots on, I started up the trail. The first mile is on an old gravel road where a fairly new bridge over a creek had been built since the last time Sally and I had hiked to Ashland Lakes and Twin Falls in 2004. Once off the old road the trail heads up to the lakes with lots of rock/wood steps and flat boardwalks along the way. When I got to the junction with the Beaver Plant Lake Trail, I took a snack break. Then It was  1/4 mile more to the junction with the Bald Mtn. Ridge Trail. Here I was hiking on a trail I had last hiked 30 years ago. I was surprised to see that it was still in pretty good shape, as someone has been doing some trail maintenance over the years. I passed some large rock formations and glacier erratics along the way. Only had a few places for views out to different peaks. There are many large 300 year old fir and cedar trees. Blueberry bushes had berries to eat, but they were tart. After going by the big split rock, the trail switchbacks up to a ridge next to a really big rock outcropping, then goes back down hill before getting to a small boulder field. I could see out to another peak in the distance. Since it was around lunch time, I decided this was as far I was going today. I found a spot in the shade to eat. The only bugs I encountered all day found me as I was having lunch. A few deer flies showed up to buzz around me. Further on, the Bald Mtn.Ridge Trail becomes a route finding trail in order to get to Bald Mtn. and Cutthroat Lakes at the Walt Bailey Trail. So it is not a trail for the casual hiker if you're doing the whole length. The trail is in the DNR Morning Star Natural Resources Conservation Area. The BMRT is shown on GT and DNR maps, but not listed on the DNR trail list. Parts of this trail are better to hike on than the Ashland Lakes Trail. I had fun checking out an old trail from 30 years ago. There were a few trees across the trail, but easy to get over. Never saw anyone else the whole time, so no conga line of hikers going up and down the trail like other Mtn. Loop Highway hikes like Pilchuck, Heather Lake and Lake 22. George.

Lakes Loop	gemhikes	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Intermittent snow - not hard to cross	I hiked from Reflection Lakes to Paradise Glacier for MeadoWatch, a UW/NPS citizen science project on alpine wildflowers and climate change, then continued on my own to make a loop of it by coming down from Paradise Glacier to the lower Skyline trail (upper was totally socked in) to Paradise, then dropped down the Lakes Trail and then cut over on the High Lakes trail to get back to my starting point. It was a pretty damp and wet day on Saturday with no views of Rainier, but that made the trails a little quieter. The trail is in good shape throughout, though I stopped at the edge of the unmaintained trail to Paradise Glacier where the snow starts since the visibility was so poor and I was solo. The water wasn't running high enough on the way to Paradise Glacier to require any crossings. The High Lakes trail has seen less use than the others recently and was as little more overgrown. Marmots out and about per usual and one deer on the High Lakes trail, but that was about it for wildlife. Peak wildflowers have passed but there are still many beauties on the Lakes Trail. I would recommend starting at Reflection Lakes and hiking up to Paradise (rather than vice versa) since the incline seemed more gradual going up that way. 	Aug 11, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-16.7951733579
Iron Creek Falls	austineats	Obstacles on trail:	    Mud/Rock slide or washout.	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	On our way to Windy Ridge to explore the Mount Saint Helens NE corner we noted this little hiking opportunity. It is a perfect stop for small hikers who might be needing out of the car (like my wife). The trail today was instantly cool, green, and inviting. Ferns and mosses litter the floor. The trail is very short and mostly in good condition. Normal streamside erosion has undercut the bank and the trail degrades as it gets down to the stream. No worries though, there are a few ways down and they aren’t difficult. We headed down stream initially through a fun tangle of immense cedars, which now have created a cave of sorts to walk through. A large pool of crystal clear water ambles and eddies just beyond under towering trees. We wished it were hotter so that we’d have an excuse to jump in. Alas, another time. Turning our attention to the falls we scrambled about for good photographic angles. Once again, a perfect spot for a swim but the day was just too cool. We will be back. All told we were out of the car for ~45 minutes. It was a needed break from the drive.  	Aug 11, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-15.2310119470
Kendall Katwalk	ChinWusanosan	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	The trailhead was easy to find on Google Maps using "Kendall Katwalk Trailhead." We arrived around 800am, parking lot was roughly half full. The trail is in great condition; it does get rocky in a few spots though our dog was able to navigate it without much difficulty. The incline is gradual throughout without too many noticeable steep spots. I have heard conflicting information from different sources concerning the leash law; my impression was that the trail is "voice control" for dogs, however we had two people complain that our dog was off leash so we wound up leashing him regardless. We went about another two miles past the actual Katwalk and stopped for lunch at one of the nearby lakes. I didn't find this necessary but most people in my group enjoyed it. The only time we noticed any bugs was when we stopped at the lake. Overall, we really enjoyed the trail and plan to return in the future.

Westport State Park - Westport Light Trail	ToddlerTrekking	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	We took a wander on the trails down into the woods that branch off from the Dune Trail near the first overlook. It is a really beautiful coastal forest to hike through with some trees that absolutely glow when the light hits the moss. We haven't explored all the trails yet but there is a network back in there. This time we went to the lighthouse and back for a little over 1.5 miles roundtrip. This summer, my four-year-old son and I are hiking to raise money for Washington Trails Association.

Miller Peninsula-Thompson Spit	wishfulwanderer	Obstacles on trail:	    Muddy or wet trail,	    Overgrown in places.	Road suitable for all vehicles	A group of us decided to check out this spot since we were just up the road for a family reunion. Lots of parking at the trailhead and you can purchase a one-day Discover Pass there if you have cash or check; be warned though, the drop box for the fee envelope is missing the locked door so anyone could take your payment from there or it could probably get blown out if it's windy enough. Best to bring your own annual pass if you have it. The trail is very green and mossy but there were also lots of dead leaves on the trail which made it feel like fall. As previously noted, there are lots of trails that are not always well signed. If you have Gaia GPS, you can see the trail on the map - this makes it easy to find your route - I've also included a link to our route. We decided to head out to the bluff trail. We picked our way through. Mostly the trail was well maintained, but there were some overgrown areas. Early on, we noticed hundreds of tiny black frogs on the trail that would scurry into the bushes as we walked through - watch your step! Not much of a view at the bluff but I enjoyed the rain forest vibe. Once we reached the bluff, it started to rain, lightly at first but soon turned into a downpour and thunderstorm. Of course none of us came prepared for that. A few times it seemed like the thunder was cracking right over our heads. We hurried out as fast as we could but it was a long way back. I was so glad to have a GPS so we could find the quickest way back to the cars. We ended up having to take some of the more overgrown trails just because they were more direct. The trail was dry on the way in, but puddles quickly formed with the heavy rain. We finally made it back and dove into the cars. This would make a great trail-running trail due to the mild gains in elevation and the cool forest feel. Now that I know how long the trail is I will be more cautious about going out in stormy weather. I wouldn't make a special trip to visit the trail, but if you're nearby, it's a nice one. BUGS: I got two bug bites, but wasn't wearing any repellent. Specs: 8.43mi, 2hr 57min, 521ft	Aug 11, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-13.7586072519
Snowgrass Flat	skicat	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	We left our camp on the Bypass trail, & took the Snowgrass Flat trail to the Lily Basin trail to Goat Lake. The day started out cloudy. Bugs werent too bad. Clouds came in as we approached the lake. Wild flowers were out, especially paintbrush, bistorts & pasque flowers. Goat Lake was beautiful, it even had an iceberg floating in the middle of it. We had lunch & pictures on the shore, & then the rain started. We could see the dark clouds coming, & unfortunately, we left our rain gear back at the campsite. We walked above the lake, where there were several snow fields. The snow made for  good pictures in August! There were quite a few people at the lake, having lunch & setting up camps. We returned the way we came, in the rain, to our wet campsite. The trails were good, no obstacles. From our camp, it was 4 miles to the lake, & 4 miles to the car at the Snowgrass Flat trailhead from our camp. So if you do this as a day hike, it will be about 16 miles. Totally worth it, though!	Aug 11, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-13.6873252476
Chain Lakes	bryter	Obstacles on trail:	    Trees down across trail,	    Muddy or wet trail.	Road suitable for all vehicles	The hike start is pretty straight forward as you start on the PCT at Steven's Pass which is easy enough to follow and head South. Once you get to Lake Josephine, take the trail to your left and wind on down to Josephine and then through the valley, which in this case was wet from light rain. Once you cut left off of the Icicle Creek trail, the trail forgets about switch backs and heads pretty much straight up the hill until near the top where it finally sidehills some. The first lake has one campsite to the right when you first get there and the second lake has two nice spots at the beginning just past the sign that says trail which takes you over the small creek formed from the second lake dumping into the first. I saw folks camping on the other side, but I have no idea of the site conditions. I fly fished both of these lakes, but not the third which I never visited. The first lake had the bigger fish, but once I realized how warm both lakes were, I stopped fishing. They were better for swimming in, had I been in the mood. Not much wildlife to see.

Grand Valley	Randy	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Two of us for a day hike to Grand Lake and Moose Lake.  The road is in good shape and appears to have been recently graded.  The trail is amazing!  We elected to go in and out via the Grand Valley Trail (instead of the Badger Valley Loop).  We had decent clearing and incredible views from Obstruction Point then the rain hit just as we left the ridge.  There was only one group at Grand Lake which is gorgeous.  Make sure to check out the waterfall behind the backcountry privy there.  Moose Lake, also beautiful, was pretty full of tents probably from the WTA work party we met.  The entire trail is a work of art.  The climb up is a nice work out and the rain let up just as we climbed out of the valley.  Highly recommended.

Quinault Rainforest Nature Loop	jansbackpack	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Excellent viewing of huckleberry, thimble berry, and wild blueberry.  Moderate rain fall, considering it's a rain forest, and the streams and vegetation were beautiful.  	Aug 11, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-12.2369678727
Navaho Pass	vikr	Obstacles on trail:	    Trees down across trail.	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Most of the trail up to the pass is under the trees with almost no views. Even the Stafford creek is very well below you so you are not walking along the creek. Most of the trail is moderate incline except may be last half or one mile before the pass. Once you get out of trees there is almost no shade so be prepared for that. The views starts from meadows and keep on getting better and better only two cars parks at trailhead when we started around 10 am.  We might have seen may be one of two tents while going up. While coming down saw so many people camping near meadows and many headed up while we came further down. It might get crowded. I did this hike for first time but my friend who had been here was surprised to see so many people backpacking on this trail. Many people trail running, some running with their dogs. There were no bugs probably due to colder weather. There was a awesome camping spot just above the pass while going up the peak. Would like to come there for camp the next time.

Slide Lake	matt030709	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	I decided to hike Slide Lake on Saturday morning in order to avoid the rain in the afternoon. The trail is in great condition, with all blow downs either cleared or having a path around or over. It was overcast and cloudy, so the views weren't spectacular. However, the clouds change the focus to the surrounding forest and the hike to the lake does not disappoint in that regard. The old growth is spectacular. The trees are impressive. Many of the rocks and downed trees are covered in a thick layer of moss. The huckleberries are ripe, there were probably thousands of them along the trail. I had a few and I'm happy to report they were delicious. I wore pants, which was helpful because the bushes do make the trail narrow at points and they were wet, but I think it wouldn't be too bad in shorts. The lake was quite beautiful. Its water was clear. Due to the clouds, I couldn't see Snowking Mountain, but the way the fog moved above the lake and through the trees still made quite a view. I grabbed a boulder near the western shore of the lake and had lunch. There were a few groups camping there (maybe 3 or 4), but there was plenty of space for everyone. I saw at least a couple of trout swimming in the lake, so I imagine there's good fishing in the lake, which isn't a bad idea considering its relatively accessible for carrying fishing gear in. Hopefully all those camping missed the major rain storm that hit later in the afternoon. I was fortunate to be out of there before that hit. The road to the trailhead is quite long, but its in good shape for a dirt road. There are a few pot holes, but nothing that you can't easily navigate with any vehicle. If its a clear day, the views on the drive would make it worth the drive in itself. It is a one lane road most of the time and it will be impossible to avoid the vegetation on both sides of your car at points. 	Aug 11, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-12.5211588183
Ebey's Landing	ravennspirit	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	With a sketchy weather forecast, we decided to visit Ebey's Landing, a hike we usually save for the winter months. We were so glad we chose this one, we had fabulous weather during our hike; the rain held off until we were back at the car! Several parking options available, we used the lot across from the cemetery. A nice new restroom is adjacent to the other upper parking area, close to where the new Pratt Loop trail begins. We elected to start with the Pratt Loop trail, which adds an additional 1.3 miles to the original hike mileage. This leads through a mostly forested section, but offers some nice peak-a-boos through the trees to some of the historic buildings and farmland. After all the hot dry weather recently, it was great to walk through the trees and have moisture in the air from last night's rain. Even the banana slugs were out enjoying the cooler temps. After completing the Pratt Loop, we rejoined the main trail at the bluff, and hiked along it for a beach walk return. Quite a few flowers still in bloom: catchfly, sand verbena, western salsify, yarrow. We even found the tiny flowers of pickleweed growing on the shores of Perego's Lake at the base of the bluff. While this is usually a great place to see eagles and hawks, these birds were conspicuously absent; however there were several species of sandpipers and a giant multi-species flock of gulls, who seem to be molting. The beach in places looked like the scene of a giant down pillow fight with all the shed feathers. The tide was out on the beach, which made for pleasant beachcombing and easier walking on the compacted wet sand. Perhaps because of the unpredictable weather, there were not a lot of people on this trail today. It seemed a pretty even mix of locals and some tourists from far away places; I "talked trail" for a while with a small group visiting from Australia. The docents were manning the historical buildings today; they are a wealth of knowledge and their enthusiasm for this area and its history is contagious. The only downside about this hike today was the increasing prevalence of folks leaving dog-poo bags on the trail. Tons of new signs have been added throughout to encourage dog owners NOT to abandon plastic poo bags; despite this we encountered about 20 bags dropped on the side of the trail, hung on fences or driftwood, some tossed into the hedgerows and woods. It always astounds me when a park is not only providing multiple trash barrels at strategic points for waste disposal, but also the bags to pick up dog waste, folks still behave so irresponsibly =/	Aug 11, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-11.6055705664
Lake Edna	Heleene Tambet	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Lake Edna hike was awesome! As always, once you clear the forest line it's just pure pleasure and incredible views. Our favorite parts were perhaps the green creeks and flowery meadows right below Edna, not the lake itself.  Trail is in pretty good condition. 4h for back and forth for us (running).

The Enchantments	C P	Minor obstacles posing few problems	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Intermittent snow - not hard to cross	Hiked from Colchuck T.H. to Snow Lakes T.H. as a day hike.  11 hours walking, 18 miles, 4000' up, 7000' down.  Lots of people were doing it this way today. I caught an already scheduled Leavenworth Shuttle from the lower T.H. at 7:30, just enough time.  Many others will be coming out in the dark.  Shuttles can be ordered from 5AM to 2AM.  Driver Mike said He had already made 2 trips before ours, $25 per person for groups of 3 or more (509-548-RIDE).  Let them do the rough road driving, my car was safe at the bottom. Trail is confusing with or without a map.  I was alone but hooked up with a group who knew the trail and we still took a few wrong turns.  Would have been nerve wracking by myself.  Do it on a weekend when there are lots of others to guide you.  	Aug 11, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-11.6283039855

Mailbox Peak - Old Trail	paubears08	Trail difficult/impossible to navigate:	    Trees down across trail,	    Overgrown in places.	Road suitable for all vehicles	Finally made it to Mailbox! A few points of note for those newbies, like us, right after the road turns back into a 2 lane road (from a one way), start looking to your right, where you will see a "lot" with no cars. Right across the street to your left there is a pullover that can fit about 10. Pull into the lot (on the right) and follow the arrows up a small hill and around the corner (which is out of sight) to the real lot that can fit up to 40 cars and has the restrooms.  Once in the lot, head back the way you drove in and look to your right where you will find a big white gate and trail sign for Mailbox. This is the way you want to go no matter which trail you want to take (old or new).  If you are looking for the old trail keep walking past the sign for the new trail and right before you get to the bridge over a creek, look to your left to find the old trail sign. We decided to take the old trail up since it was shorter and the new trail down because it's supposed to be easier on the knees.  Just a quick caveat, we did this with a 9 month old in a carrier (not for the faint of heart) and my 8 year old who thought the old trail was "fun."  He was the one in charge of finding the diamonds when the trail became too difficult to navigate due to all the blow downs.  The old trail was definitely worth it if you are able to do it, we made it to the mailbox and back to where the two trails meet by the time a group (that we met in the parking lot who took the new trail) made it to the connector right before the boulder field. Plus, the new trail isn't very scenic so you aren't missing anything by taking the quicker route up. The old route involves some spots where you might want to put your hands on the ground and crawl...it's steep. There are parts where you need to grab onto roots or trees to help pull yourself up (if you don't have poles). Just be liberal with your breaks and make sure you carry bandaids in case you feel blisters coming on. A bonus to taking the old trail, the berries are ripe right now. We made it up in 2.5 hrs. After the  old and new trails connect you end up at a boulder field, just know that you still have a way to go from there, it feels like you turn a corner thinking you are almost there and you go...crap...as you see all the tiny people still ascending, don't let it put you off, you can do it! Fortunately, it was the first cool day we've had in awhile. Unfortunately, that was due to a storm system moving in so we missed out on the views due to all the cloud cover and we got rained on for an hour about halfway point on our hike down.  The hike down, much like Mt. Si, is just a slog on the new trail. It seems to take forever and it ends up being 5 miles (one way) instead of 4.5 miles, but it wouldn't have been possible with the baby to go back down the way we went up. Overall,  I have to admit to liking Mailbox better than Mt. Si. There are a few views on the old trail and there and more scenic transitions (forest, meadow, boulder field, etc.)	Aug 11, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-11.1968381246
Cold Creek Loop via Tinkham and Silver Peaks	Ups n Downs	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Not the big trip just the first mile on the Cold Creek lower trail to Twin Lakes which is a good kid hike.  The trail's in great condition with a little elevation gain at the beginning along the hillside above the creek among some nice older growth trees.   Having been here a few times before we pushed to find the upper lake which proved advantages.  From the junction with the Mt. Catherine trail we went straight following a bushwhack trail over trees and through brush to the north of the lower lake but it became too difficult for the kids.  Though we had encountered some sun breaks after coming over the pass, by the time we reached a small creek a heavy rain started pouring and the wind kicked up.  Fortunately the dense tree cover kept us dry so we ate snacks and rode it out.  After about 15-20 minutes the rain abated and we chose to head north along the creek where we soon spotted a cabin.   A trail leading from there followed further along the creek and uphill where we passed two excellent waterfalls, one with a deep pool that would have been welcomed last week. Arriving at the remains of an old road that appeared to head toward the upper lake on our Cal Topo map, the kids expressed that they were done with the adventure part of our trip.  So we hiked back to the lower lake where we took pictures then headed out.  It was a fun day with good friends.

Mima Falls	geecal	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	What a nice trail and kudos for the superb signage along the route and at intersections.  Can't get too lost here!   The falls were a bit low-flow - it is August, after all, so I'll have to plan a trip back here to see them during a time when the flow is a bit grander.  It was a rainy day, so I kept my trip short - taking the direct route and going just past the falls to the next crossing I hit just over 2 miles one way. A nice area and close with lots of trails.  I will be back to explore these trails more!	Aug 11, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-11.1427206201
Bullitt Access Trail	EmilB	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	We arrived at the Mountainside Drive Trailhead at about 2 PM on a cloudy Saturday; we were the fourth car to park at the lot. Like many Squak trails: - The trail climbs at a comfortable, steady pace; before you know it you've gained several 100 vertical feet. - As soon as you turn the corner out of the parking lot, you wouldn't know you are close to houses; you feel immediately immersed in wilderness. - You largely have to place to yourself; we passed one family on our way back to the lot, and that was it. - The draw is the territory; no crashing waterfalls, no stunning vistas, just lovely second growth woods and looking down into some vertiginous valleys.

Mount Rose	NOWISM	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Are you looking for a thigh incinerating workout? Look no further! This hike is unrelentingly steep. It's straight up from the get-go and doesn't level out until about 2.8 miles up, well into the "summit loop". There aren't many panoramic views along the way since the forest is pretty dense, but I didn't mind since the tree cover afforded me some shade on a hot day. The trail is in great shape and easy to navigate. Once at the top, you get a stunning view of the Olympics and of Lake Kushman. I did the summit loop clockwise and found that it was level from about 2.8 miles to 3.4 miles--a welcome break from the hellish climb. Then I began the descent. It was a quick and relatively easy trip back down (but I like steep descents). The whole hike took me about 4.5 hours (with a stop for lunch). At the trailhead there's a conveniently placed staircase leading down to the lake where you can reward yourself with a swim.

Lake Ingalls	chloek	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	No bugs	Snow free	Got to the trailhead around 7am and the lot was already full. However, we didn't really see anyone on the trail on the way up! This is a really popular trailhead for overnight trips, and we passed dozens of backpackers heading up as we descended.  The trail is in pretty great condition, though very exposed for most of the way so be warned about that! We didn't really encounter any bugs which was amazing! There are a few patches of rocky terrain and getting to the actual lake takes a little easy scrambling, but its manageable.  We were lucky and saw several mountain goats, too!

Mount St. Helens - Monitor Ridge	BrittKnee	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	You can read every other trail report to hear about the ascent, but no one tells you how torturous the downhill is! My group of four actually enjoyed the varying terrain going up Monitor Ridge, however coming down through the boulder field was agonizing and seemed to last FOREVER! My legs felt like they were ready to give out every step I took and by the end I felt like a baby giraffe who was just learning to walk. Unfortunately we went on one of the rare rainy/garbage weather days this summer with no view at the summit, but I don't think I will go again because my knees just might not be able to handle it. 	Aug 11, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-16.9504027734
South Puyallup To Wonderland	Elizabeth “Ducky”	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Another beautiful day for trail work with WTA during #HikeaThon After a week of not working on this trail we picked up where we left off July 29. Our work began about .6 miles from the trail head. This portion of trail does have one large step about a foot and a half high, that hopefully we will be able to fix before the summer is over. The trail also has some ferns and huckleberries infringing on the trail in some places.There are also a about three little creeks that had been dried up last time we were up there, but due to the recent rain they were flowing, but not that much to where you still couldn't just step over them. The part of the trail that has been washed out, can get confusing a some points so just look for the pink flagging. Half of the group worked on a re-route where the South Puyallup River has washed away the trail. The rest of us worked up the trail about another quarter of a mile on the actual South Puyallup Trail. We worked on widening a section of trail that is on a steep bank above the river. We were able to widen the trail from about a foot wide to about three and a half feet wide. We also removed various tree roots to help widen the trail. Towards the end of the day a few of us moved a large fallen rotting tree out of the middle of where the trail will be re-routed to. Not many hikers on this trail even in nice weather. There was a large group that passed us on our hike in, but throughout the day we only had about four hikers pass by our handy work. Unlike last time we were working on this area of trail, there were no bugs out today, maybe it was due to the weather and beautiful drizzle that we need oh so bad. Come out and join us on the trails sometime, it's a ton of fun, and you get a better application for hiking trails. wta.org/volunteer If you'd like to give back to WTA and their trail crews right now is Hike A Thon through the end of August, feel free to donate any amount of money to my campaign by going to give.wta.org/Elizabeth Hikes Until next time- Happy Trails	Aug 11, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-15.5054922544
Park Lakes	Dugger	Obstacles on trail:	    Trees down across trail,	    Muddy or wet trail,	    Overgrown in places.	Park Lakes - Trudging with a purpose on the way up, Slodging with determination on the way down! Headed in on an overcast Saturday for Park lakes basin. The 1st water crossing ( 1/4 mile in) had a log across the river, secured to the sides with cables (easy). The next part of the trail was nice and wide with occasional views of Mineral creek and great views of the surrounding mountains. Trail was in good condition and is an old mining road for a portion of it. Trail meanders in an upward direction. Then comes the 2nd crossing which you have several options 1) put your watershoes on 2) walk across rocks 3) Rock and tilted log. All 3 options work. Once you get on the other side of the creek is when the trail becomes interesting. You will be traversing thru many sections of heavy maple, and other smaller trees, bushes and brush...along with a great many berry bushes and flowers (old avalanche chutes).  One of the pictures shows 4 different sections of the trail. So all that said, the trail is very doable, just need to be a little flexible in areas around and thru the trees.  Also hiking poles did come in handy to push some of the brush out of the way to see the trail and just for an extra point of contact. Just go slow, which will allow you ability to see the trail and the amazing scenery around you. Remember its the journey not necessarily the destination.  Someone had gone on the trail not too long ago and did do some cutting back in areas (THANK YOU whoever did it). After you get thru the seemingly never-ending brush, you end up in tall timber and eventually to an older campsite.  Just keep going straight over the edge and you will find the trail down to the lower Park Lake creek and then up the other side of the canyon. The trail eventually ends up in the basin area. There was never a really bad uphill portion on the trail (except coming out of canyon after campsite -and wasn't bad), but there was a constant uphill the whole way. There are probably 2 or 3 nice campsites with a half dozen other ones that will work at the Upper Park lake.  Bugs were a little buggy when the  wind stopped blowing, but unfortunately it didn't stop too much and it was a very cold wind (also rain on/off all afternoon did not help)! But when it stopped...watch out, they will find you. A good dose of bug spray and a bug net makes it tolerable. With rain on/off all evening and a little rain in the morning we knew that the trail home would be a nice slodge (ie.. a sloppy trudge!)! I think that every drop that came down landed on the leaves and brush next to the trails. Warning---- If there is any possibilities of water/moisture I would bring/wear rain gear.  It is amazing how much water a single leave will hold, especially when dumped on your head as you are going under/around it, along with its neighbors! A little moisture will also make some of the trail slickery, so slow is better than being dragged off the hill.  Total time for non-aggressive hikers is 5 hours up and a little under 4 on the way down (Brick in Roslyn calling our names...maybe a little quicker down).

Spray Park Loop	croe	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Intermittent snow - not hard to cross	Members of our Hike-a-Thon team hit the Spray Park Loop via Ipsut Creek campground this weekend.  Unfortunately, Saturday had the worst weather Western Washington has seen in months, but it definitely added to the adventure factor.  We hiked counter-clockwise in order to ascend Ipsut Pass early.  Despite quite a bit of rain and fog, the sun came out for a few minutes as we hit Spray Park and gave us a glimpse of the mountain in all her glory.  Overall, the trail is in great condition, with varied terrain and lots of water readily available - we're definitely looking forward to hitting this route again on a clear day!  Be aware that a section of the Wonderland Trail is washed out between Cataract Valley and Ipsut Creek campground.  We had read about it in other trip reports, but the ranger failed to mention it when we stopped to pick up our permits.  The detour route over to the Northern Loop trail is well marked, and the suspension bridge over the river is wild!  According to the map, the full loop, including the detour, clocks in at 18.1 miles.  Happy hiking!

East Fork Foss - Necklace Valley	Sean	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	This is a fantastic trail. Almost no switchbacks, and great views the majority of the way. I was aspiring to make the loop around Iron Cap Mtn and down the West Fork Foss trail, but the cloud cover was so low and thick at tank lakes that I didn't feel comfortable wandering off trail in low visibility. Especially since the only directions I had for this section we're based off landmarks that I couldn't see.  Trail is in great shape, but degrades to mostly following cairns past Opal lake. There are many options for additional lakes to visit along the way for a bit of extra effort. Ilswoot is worth stopping by, the color is spectacular. Even on the most crowded of days, there will likely be an abundance of camping spots to pick from all along the trail. 	Aug 11, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-13.3600944040
Granite Creek Trail to Granite Lakes	Tdogpack	Minor obstacles posing few problems	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	We parked at the Twin Falls Middle School and took the Metro shuttle (yay Metro) up to the Mailbox Peak trailhead and walked up the road about .2 miles to the Granite Lakes Connector Trailhead. The parking there is limited and judging by the lack of people we saw on our trail mostly taken up by MP hikers. The trail climbs steadily with some longish sections overgrown to the point that the trail is obscured by this year's growth. Still easy to follow the trail but on the day we went, the vegetation was wet, even before the afternoon shower, and we got wet, which was not unpleasant, just moist. Hit the "official" Granite Lakes Trail, turned right and continued the steady ascent. Trail is wide and in good shape. Got to the lake but unfortunately the one good access point had a group of three people who appeared to have camped illegally overnight and who were also smoking dope and a bit noisy. We lunched at the stream outlet, which was fine. A good day overall.	Aug 11, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-13.5573270348
Mount Washington	atlanticsoutheast	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	A tiny notch easier than mount si although comparable in length and incline. Arrived in the parking lot at 1pm on a Saturday and it was about half full, a couple deep potholes but manageable. On the way up there are a few intersections that are clearly marked but some you need to rely on little etchings some kind hiker has inscribed on trees or posts. Fear not! This was my first time and I was alone and as long as I was willing to pause for a quick second at the few crossroads and search for the etchings on the posts, I didn’t take a single wrong turn thank you Jesus. The trail itself is easy to follow but in some parts is either pretty overgrown (although one can hardly complain of an abundance of plants if you choose to go on a hike in the WOODS) or the terrain consists of loose, medium sized rocks that threaten your ankles every third step, I would not consider that a huge issue, it’s more of a mild inconvenience that added some minutes to my adventure as I slowed down to avoid collapsing. The day I went it started pouring rain when I was about a mile in and stopped pouring about a mile from the top, hoping the sun would burn through the clouds I raced to the top to find a wish come partially true, I could hear I90 but see nothing in that direction but good news, the only view I had was of Chester Morse lake, fully visible from the top. On the way down, some misty obstruction had moved and revealed stunning, sunny suntown. Also, tons of salmonberries, everywhere. Overall I think I still prefer mount Si even if Mount Washington has less foot traffic.	Aug 11, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-12.9383925026
Mount Ellinor	FrankieEstep	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	No bugs	Snow free	Hiked the Upper Trail to Mt Ellinor on Saturday 8/11. We were camping down the road at Big Creek Campground and it was a nice addition to our camping trip. The road getting there was a little bumpy, but not bad. The weather was pretty rainy and foggy the whole time we were up there, which covered most of the views we were hoping to see. We did luck out and there were intermittent periods of some visibility and we were able to see Lake Cushman, which was beautiful. Beginning of hike is woody and beautiful. Then comes lots of rocks and the last leg is hiking up stairs to the summit. Was hoping to see some mountain goats, but I think the weather kept them from coming out. Would love to do again when I can plan for better weather, but it was still a great hike nonetheless.	Aug 11, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-12.3938771081
Boulder Lake	gofastdan	Trail difficult/impossible to navigate:	    Trees down across trail,	    Bridge out,	    Muddy or wet trail,	I've wanted to hike to Boulder Lake for awhile now.  Saturday morning I set out intending to hike to the Greider lakes.  Once I got to the Greider lakes trailhead I thought, hmm, maybe I'll continue on instead and go to Boulder Lake instead.  This was my first mistake.  This website (WTA) has a disclaimer saying the trail is washed out and closed.  The washed out part really isn't correct.  The trailhead itself has signs up saying the bridge over Boulder creek is out.  Again, not quite correct.  In actuality there are still two large logs over the creek that formed the base of the bridge.  The state took everything else out because supposedly it was rotten.  It will be 50 years though before the trees rot enough to make it truly uncrossable.  DNR is just making certain they don't have any liability because one thing that's true is if you slip and fall off one of the logs you will probably not walk out under your own power.  It's about 15 feet down to the creek and it's all rock down there.  So, sure, the bridge is out.  Don't do it. To back up, you know you've made a mistake the second you pass the trailhead for Greider Lakes.  The trail is almost immediately grown up around you with various types of brush and, if it's rained anytime recently like it had this day, you are immediately soaked from your chest down.  If your wife had been with you reason would have spoken and you would have turned around and went to the Greider lakes.  She was not.  I kept going.  After a couple of miles of this you come to the actual Boulder Lake trailhead.  You read the disclaimers about the bridge being out.  You ignore them and cross the logs. You think that maybe now that you're on the "real" trail it may get better.  It does not.  It's even more overgrown.  Eventually you'll come to some open slopes covered with boulders and have to cross them.  Boulders completely overgrown with vegetation.  Vegetation taller than you are.  If your wife was here the voice of reason would say you should call it a day and go home.  She is not here and you proceed.  Someone has blazed the trail with some ribbon here and there but mostly the trail is by feel.  This is far more dangerous than the bridge.  There is so much growth you have to poke and prod each step to make sure you don't slip and fall between the rocks. Eventually you make it across several of these types of fields and back into the forest.  You are soaked from head to toe.  You think you must be in the clear now.  You are not. Another half mile or so the trail suddenly disappears.  Later I figured out that there was a bridge that actually was completely taken out by a fallen tree.  I crossed to the other side of the stream to where the bridge had been and the trail seemed to continue.  In reality I should have done a switchback before the bridge, but it's not visible unless you know where to look.  I figured this out when I came back down the trail much later.  Did I mention that the trail is almost non-existent at this point?  Anyway, once I was off-trail I decided to cut up the hill until I intersected it again.  This was stupid. There are huge blueberry bushes everywhere.  The fact that they're ripe right now does nothing to lessen the fact that these things are almost impossible to push your way through. Where there are no blueberries there are patches of little scrub cedar trees that are even worse.  By now my shins were a bloody mess.  If you can't take a hint and insist on doing this hike, wear long pants and your snow gaiters to protect your legs. Anyway, after battling this stuff for a 1/2 mile or so I finally found the trail again...and then lost it again and started the whole process over again.  About right now if my wife had been there the voice of reason would have been telling me about how we could have been eating a nice lunch at one of the Greider lakes and be about ready to head back down the mountain.  I was on my own. Four hours and 7 1/2 miles from when I left the car I finally made it to the lake. In reality it's a nice little lake.  The bugs weren't to bad for this time of year.  It had been misty off and on but God had mercy and it wasn't raining at the moment so I sat for 15 minutes and had lunch.  There are some places where you could camp, and you'd almost certainly be alone.  For sure I will not be there. I started back down and it almost immediately started raining, for real this time.  None of this misty stuff.  I was already soaked but the rain made me cold so I had to put on my rain jacket anyway. Again God showed some measure of mercy and I managed to stay on the trail the whole way down. I made it across the bridge (it's out!) again and finally got back to the Greider lakes trailhead.  About this time the rain turned into a torrential downpour.  It didn't matter.  At the beaver pond not far from the parking lot (I didn't mention that earlier?) I turned a rock and put both feet in the water.  It didn't matter.   I finally made it back to the parking lot 15 miles and 7 1/2 hours after leaving.  God showed the most mercy here and the sun came out for the first time in the day just as I got to the truck.  If my wife were here the voice of reason would be saying that we could have been home a couple of hours ago and I could almost have the oil in the car changed by now.  Hmm...guess the day wasn't so bad after all. But the bridge is out.	Aug 11, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-12.6206748895
Craft Island	Ron Larson	Obstacles on trail:	    Muddy or wet trail.	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	This is a wonderful hike at a minus tide as the mudflats of Skagit Bay go on forever. To get to the TH travel from I-5 on the Fir Island road, turn west onto Rawlins Road and travel until it dead-ends at a gate for access a dike protecting farmland. Walk around the gate and up to the top of the dike and the trail, such as it is, begins on the other side as it drops into the marsh. The marsh property is a wildlife reserve. The trail is primitive and crosses a number old drainage ditches on logs and boards. The trail is currently muddy and water covered in a number of places so boots or water shoes are in order. It is approximately a half mile to reach the island. Once on the Island the mud flats can be walked in a southerly direction for a great distance depending on how low the tide is. The marsh currently in bloom with a variety of flowers 	Aug 11, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-12.4409195672
Phelps Creek	c.j.mcdonn	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Had a great hike in from Phelps Creek trail head to Spider Meadow. Set up camp and explored the meadow. In the evening (8/11/18) USFS came by to notify everyone the trails were being closed the next day, due to the Lost Fire. Unknown when the area will re-open. Hike out Sunday morning was uneventful.	Aug 11, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-12.6192702180
Fortune Ponds	cemh	Trail difficult/impossible to navigate:	    Muddy or wet trail,	    Overgrown in places,	    Mud/Rock slide or washout.	The dirt forest service road from Beckler to TH is plagued with intermittent, deep potholes.  Nothing impossible for even a small car to navigate, but go slow and keep your eyes peeled. The trail does have a relatively steep initial grade (almost 900 ft in the first mile) that flattens out (~266 ft/mi average for the next four miles).  Another steeper mile (611 ft) between milemarkers 5 and 6, and after that the rest of the way to the ponds is relatively tame. The trail is crossed by numerous avalanche chutes in the Meadow creek section of the trail, and these portions are overgrown with small brushy plants.  Recent rain or dew will cover your legs and sometimes arms, face, and pack.  I found wet shorts more comfortable than wet pants but YMMV. The trail is fairly swampy.  Lots of wide spring crossings with no real way to avoid getting your feet wet.  A few easy creek crossings. At the pond, there are a few established campsites and a wilderness toilet.  We were the only folks camped there that night (possibly due to rain...).  The pond was surprisingly warm.  The air temperature and rain was cold, maybe 40-50°F, but the pond was north of 70°F.  No good place to cool backpacking soda. I wouldn't really recommend this hike either as a dayhike or a backpacking trip.  The uneven grading matters less for dayhikers but the brushiness and swampiness sucks for everyone. The ponds connect south/south-east to the PCT and north-ish to the old Cascade Crest Trail (marked with an anonymous "Abandoned trail ahead" sign).

Navaho Peak	vikr	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	The ascent to peak from Novaho Pass is steep with almost no shade. Rewarding Unobstructed views from the top. Started around 10 am from trailhead only 2 other cars before us at trailhead. Reached top around 2pm and almost no one there. Had lunch there and came back down around 5:30pm. Saw many people going up with overnight backpacks. Though parking is small and can accomodate 5 cars but atleast 10-15 cars parked along road. Winds were strong and cold at peak. However there were patches while going up where there was no wind. So I had option to either keep the windshirt on or remove it multiple times but kept in on from fear of bugs as I had souvenirs from mosquitos from last week. But there were no bugs. Probably due to strong winds but only heard grasshopper so not bothered by bugs at all.  	Aug 11, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-12.7717818574
Talapus and Olallie Lakes	MuddyMegs	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	My first time in the Alpines Lakes Wilderness did not disappoint! This is a well-maintained trail suitable for beginners and experienced hikers alike. We got to the trailhead at 9am on a Saturday with the parking lot full but plenty of available parking along the gravel road. We hit Talapus Lake and then carried on to Olallie Lake, totaling about an hour and 15 minutes. The lakes were very pretty and tranquil. We ventured around Olallie to find a secluded spot to enjoy lunch, but it got swampy on the other side as we walked along overgrown trails. Of note, most of the spots when you arrive at Olallie Lake are taken by overnight campers so it can be hard to find opportunities for solitude, but not impossible. The way back took about an hour. Bugs weren't an issue at all with bug spray on. You can see supplies along parts of the trail that WTA volunteers are using (huge thank you)! Their work on the boardwalks and bridges are much appreciated. My favorite part of this hike, aside from the lakes of course, were the chipmunks!

Mazama Ridge - Narada Falls Trail Loop	AlpsDayTripper	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Hiked the mile of Mazama Ridge south of Skyline, the full length of the Paradise Glacier Trail, Skyline up to Panorama Point, reversing course Skyline back down to Golden Gate, Golden Gate down to Skyline, Skyline to 4th Crossing, and 4th Crossing back to the cars. There were not many areas of dense wildflower blooms. Much of the paintbrush and louseworts are starting to fade. It was a bad year for lupine, there are some fading blooms, and some gone to seed, but 90% of the lupine never flowered (lack of rain since the beginning of May, abnormally hot temperatures in July, something else). The asters are fading. Overall the predominate flowers are bistort, mouse on a stick gone to seed, Coiled-beak Lousewort, monkey flowers are coming in, and the alpine flowers in the higher, rocky areas.  The most flowery sections I hiked, 4th crossing trail, the eastern portion of the Skyline trail (from the bottom to the top of Golden Gate), there are some good pockets of flowers on the 1 mile of Mazama Ridge south of Skyline (magenta paintbrush, bracted and Rainier lousewort, a pretty field of corn silk (see pic).  	Aug 11, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-12.7217678135

Mailbox Peak	Luffles	Minor obstacles posing few problems	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Just finished a week of cabin leading at a middle school summer camp so what to do my first day home? Get up at 5am and hike Mailbox of course! This was my first time here and even without the panoramic views from the top (we were in a cloud), I could see why it is such a draw. The parking across the street had a dozen cars or maybe less when we arrived at 6:30. On our way out around 12:45 neither the upper lot nor the road parking were anywhere close to full. Perhaps the rainy forecast helped reduce crowds on this Saturday morning. Trail was in good condition all the way up with only a couple minor obstacles that, if you are trying Mailbox Peak, are in the grand scheme of things pretty inconsequential. Low on the trail just before and then after the third switchback, there are three downed narrow trees that involve maybe 6" stepovers. Then up just before the nineteenth switchback the trail is starting to get a touch overgrown, forcing hikers to step out onto the rocks along the trailside. I mostly just include them here as an FYI for trail maintenance planning. The forest lower down the mountain was lovely, even kind of spooky at times. Higher up, the talus slope and steep, flowered section above lent variety and challenge to the path. Speaking of variety, a couple ascending hikers reported to us on our way down that they had seen a bear on trail about a quarter of the way up the mountain. Reportedly it scurried off into the woods when it saw them. We did not see it as we hiked through the area they identified. Paintbrush, fireweed, explorer's gentian, and foxgloves are in bloom as you get higher up. More importantly, ripe blueberries, huckleberries, and salmonberries are all within trail's reach! As mentioned above, we were in a cloud at the top. However reaching the mailbox still made us feel nice and accomplished as we dropped to our butts. Some narrower views of North Bend and Bellevue were afforded to us lower down. Fortunately the rain held off until we reached our car! #hikingthestate	Aug 11, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-11.2899228338

Wilderness Peak Loop	Nordique	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Since the morning forecast was for showers, with thunderstorms likely in the afternoon, we chose to do a close-in short loop up  and down Wilderness Peak on Cougar Mt.  There was a running event sign at the trailhead but empty spaces in the parking area--so we assumed the sign was left from a previous event.  Once we started up the loop, however, we encountered what seemed like over 100 runners blasting down our trail at speed.  A lot of the bends on this path are blind ones, so it turned into a bad day for a hike.  We assumed that runner parking must've been at Redtown.  There was also a running event--marathon distance--out of the West Tiger Mt trailhead as well today.  We now have two websites to check before we plan weekend hikes--so as to avoid large numbers of runners on narrow hiking trails.   A good hike spoiled.  My three photos are at the photo link below.

Mailbox Peak	magickneito	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	I decided to head up to Mailbox via the Old Trail Friday after work.  It was hot and a little hazy but well worth it.  I didn't see many people coming down as I headed up before the junction with the new trail and their unleashed dogs were friendly enough when they met me first, out of eyesight of their humans as they ran ahead.  Post-junction, the final climb was interrupted to yield the right-of-way to people coming down.  I was still able to make decent time for the heat - under 2 hours up. Atop Mailbox alone with a bit of sunlight left, I decided to ridge run across to Dirtybox as well.  There was definitely a way trail that roughly followed the ridge and skirted the sketchy bouldering sections - if in doubt at an impasse, backtrack and look for said trail coming off the rocks.  At one point, the trail drops off the ridgeline to follow the southerly slope a few dozen feet below - the ridge is densely covered with trees at this point.  I followed the trail as it traversed awhile before turning back onto the ridge then it's a wooded push through an older stand until the summit.  It was only an additional half hour push for the less-travelled summit. I hit Mailbox again (and a crowd) at sunset and headed down before they were finished viewing.  The descent down the New Trail became eventful when my headlamp died but otherwise a nice cooldown after the workout up.

Tunnel Creek	moosefish	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	My 13 year old daughter and I used the Tunnel Creek trail to get to the PCT and head south for three days. The road is in great shape, but parking is limited. There were 22 cars in the lot when we returned Sunday afternoon.  The trail to Hope Lake is not “easy,” but posed no real challenges. Water is limited until Hope Lake. The lake was very warm and would make a good swim.  The PCT south was much easier to walk as far as Trap Pass. Berries are just starting to turn above Trap Lake. There are many, many great camp sites all along the PCT with lots of water available. We saw some marmot and lots of pika. Although the sky was redder than usual due to wildfire smoke we only briefly smelled it just above Hope Lake.	Aug 10, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-14.6178223415
Boulder Cave	wishfulwanderer	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Combined this hike with a trip up Edgar Rock since their trailheads are only a few miles apart. Plenty of parking at the trailhead but I suspect that it's busier on the weekends.  There is a sign at the trailhead that you aren't allowed to enter the cave if you have been into another cave with the shoes or clothes you are wearing. This is to prevent exposing the bats to a fungus that has caused millions of deaths. Make sure to plan ahead if you have visited other caves. Also make sure to bring a headlamp or flashlight if you plan to walk through the cave. It is short but very dark and would be difficult to navigate with out a light.  Before entering the cave, you can check out the waterfall which is slightly off the trail. Be careful going to and from the falls because the rocks are quite slick from wear.  Because it is a popular area, consider picking up trash if you see it. I picked up three water bottles and packed them out to recycle (no recycling available but there are some trash cans on the trail).

Chain Lakes Loop	ellebee	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Intermittent snow - not hard to cross	I did this trail with my mother, who is from southern Minnesota and does not hike much at all. We started at Artist Point and went counter-clockwise so we would descend the Wild Goose trail instead of climb it at the end of our hike, and we were happy with that decision. The trail is in great condition with just the tiniest bit of snow to cross in one or two places. Note to green hikers like my mum: this trail is at a high elevation, so if you're not acclimated, you may feel short of breath :) 	Aug 10, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-14.2647852748
Elk Mountain to Maiden Peak	KMB!	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Started at Obstruction Point Trailhead and hiked to Maiden Peak.  Despite the forest fire haze, still fantastic views in every direction.   Definitely would be more stunning without the haze.    Bring water!  Wear sunscreen!  Zero shade on the trail.  It was warm but a steady breeze kept it pleasant.   There is one point on the trail where the "faint of heart" might be a bit intimidated.   Barely a trail clinging to the side of the mountain on a scree field.  Take it slow and be careful and you will be fine.    	Aug 10, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-11.7403804628
Spray Park	MegLvs2Hike	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Intermittent snow - not hard to cross	I hiked the entire spray park trail from Carbon River to Mowich Lake as part of an overnight backpacking trip.  I started at Sunrise (will report separately on that little 16 mile jaunt) with an overnight just past Carbon River at Cataract Valley camp 1.6 miles up the Seattle Park/Spray Park trail. The hike up from my camp through Seattle Park toward the high point of the trail was beautiful. Streams and flowers everywhere with better and better views of Mother Mountain to the north. It was still kind of hazy in the midday because of the smoke and the angle of the sun so Mount Rainier itself was sort of washed out when it came into view initially but got clearer and more impressive later in the day as I descended into Spray Park. The high country between Seattle and Spray Park is pretty rugged with a few easy to cross snowfields still hanging on. Saw a marmot and some mountain goats. The flowers were still really beautiful in Seattle Park, not much left in Spray but the views of Rainier made up for it. The hike got quite a bit easier once I got to Spray Park, might be just because it was finally downhill but the trail also seemed quite a bit less technical. The shady forest the last few miles descending from the park to the lake was much appreciated on the hot, sunny day I hiked. Was meeting a ride at the campground so didn’t have time to go to Spray Falls but stopped at the Eagle Wall view and it was stunning. Mowich Lake on Friday afternoon was really crowded, kind of a shock after 2 days of backcountry quiet (Did not see anyone through my entire climb up through Seattle Park). Wished I could have spent more time out on the trails but I was pretty beat after 2 big days of hiking with a pack. Recommend this hike for anyone, lots of spur trails from Spray. Might come back and do the whole loop around mother mountain or just spend the day exploring side trails, maybe try to go as high as I can towards observation point.

Sourdough Ridge	Janice Van Cleve	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	I love the Sunrise area on Mt. Rainier.  There are so many trails in so many directions.  The purple mountain asters were in bloom everywhere, along with bistort, Indian paintbrush, and pearly everlasting.  It was hot on Friday with significant smoke from fires to the east.  100's of people were out on the mountain today.  Bugs were annoying by Sourdough Lake but otherwise not a problem. We hiked the Sourdough trail up to Frozen Lake and then on to Burroughs 1 and 2.  The trail is in fine shape all the way.  On the way to Frozen Lake I always admire the long rock wall through the talus slope.  Having built much smaller versions on WTA work parties, I appreciate the huge amount of effort that went into this one. The path atop of Burroughs 2 is not defined and people wandered all over the fragile tundra plants.  The loop down from Burroughs 1 above the White River canyon is very exposed and rocky down to the viewpoint.  Rock walls along this section are failing in several places and threaten to collapse onto the trail.

Chain Lakes Loop	dk	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Intermittent snow - not hard to cross	Hot but gorgeous hike today. The WTA description is really accurate, recommend going counter-clockwise. Steep early but oh so worth it. Hermann Saddle is beautiful as is the lake basin. We saw a couple pikas, heard (but didn't see) a marmot. Just a few tiny snowfields to cross. Great day!	Aug 10, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-10.9285659734
Blue Lake	Kimlaree	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	We were driving to eastern Washington and decided to stop and do this short hike on the way out. I’ve done this hike many times before and it’s gorgeous. But today it was very very smoky from the Twisp fire....hard to see a lot in the way of views...

Tolmie Peak Lookout - Eunice Lake	morganray_1	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	National park pass required. we got to the gravel road, we were going about 25-30 mph the whole time. Since I have a Jeep, we passed a few sedans going 15mph but those people made it just fine. It took about 25 minutes to drive along the bumpy gravel roads. Arrived at trial head a little past 8:30 as we took a break to go to the hole in the ground toilets on the way. We were 1/4 cars at the trailhead. My group consisted of my girlfriend, my girlfriends 9 year old sister, and myself. The incline was pretty decent for everyone in the group however the roots on the trail are hard for younger ones and they might need you to hold their hand for a good portion. The bugs we probably 80% flies and 20% mosquitoes. They weren’t bad in the morning but at around 11 they started to get worse. The flies will harass you and off/deet doesn’t work well on them. I highly recommend planning time to swim in the lake. It was possibly more fun than the lookout itself with the crystal clear water. I was dry by the time I got back to the car. At the peak, when we arrived it was about 11:30. The sun was on the opposite side of the mountain so it didn’t help the view. I bet if you summit around 3pm or later, the sun will start to be toward your back and the mountain will be more clear and defined. There are perks to leaving earlier because when we came back, the trailhead was an endless row of parked cars. The people who owned most of those cars probably got a better view than us and plus, this isn’t an activity where you get to complain about having to walk to your car!

Monte Cristo Ghost Town	MaddiesMama	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	This was the trip years in the making. We took 2 dogs and a 6 year old. I would not recommend this hike for most 6 year olds, but ours has been hiking for many years. The bugs were out in full force today, as well as the spiderwebs. We got there at about 10 am, we were still able to find parking in the lot. Total hike time was 4.5 hours, clear skies and butterflies the whole way.

Gothic Basin	Jbred	Obstacles on trail:	    Trees down across trail,	    Overgrown in places.	Road suitable for all vehicles	We had a wonderful hike today to the Gothic Basin with our 10 month old son! It was a more difficult hike than we expected, the trail is no joke and requires a bit of a scramble and some bouldering.  We encountered a couple of trees down about halfway up the trail, but it was easy to get across.  Carrying a child made things a bit difficult on some of the steeper climbs up boulders, but we were able to manage.  Bugs were a bit of an annoyance but not too bad.  With a few stops and a 30 minute lunch break or so it took us 6 hours from start to finish.  The difficult hike was worth the effort though once we got to the top and saw the basin, it was pretty spectacular. We spoke briefly to a ranger after the hike and he said that the Gothic Basin is becoming pretty crowded on the weekends, and that people are being irresponsible about leave no trace, so be warned.  There's also a complete fire ban if you are camping up there. 	Aug 10, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-10.7482645870
Ira Spring Trail - Mason Lake	Hikin til I Drop	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	It was a dark and stormy night... OK, OK, not really. But it WAS a warm and hazy Friday. The trailhead parking lot already had lots of vehicles in it when I arrived about 7:45am. A USFS ranger arrived shortly thereafter and began chucking accumulated hiking sticks that folks had leaned up near the trailhead off the steep edge of the lot. OK... But hey, the latrine was well-supplied with paper products, so life was good.  I got on the trail about 8:00am, fell in with some relatively fast company (we, the clan of the knee brace) and got to Mason Lake about 9:35am. Huffed and puffed a bit and snapped a couple of pics, then headed back down about 9:45am, got back to the trailhead parking lot about 11:10am. I encountered a total of 55 other hikers on the trail, or make that 50 other hikers and 5 galloping trail runners on their way down as I was still headed up. FS 9030 and FS 9031 are passable for all vehicles (but what's with the guy driving the big yellow tank truck?? Insists on having his half out of the middle, so watch out for him!) For such a popular trail, the Ira Spring Trail is in great shape thanks to WTA's maintenance and reconstruction efforts. There wasn't a profusion of wildflowers, but I did see a couple of nice stands of orange paintbrush along with scattered fireweed, lupin, a few penstemon, etc. There were also thimbleberry, salmonberry, and native trailing blackberry at places along the trail, and stands of tasty, ripe huckleberries--enough to enjoy a few pawfuls, and they were really good. Salal was blooming in places--such a lovely little flower!--so berry futures are lookin good.	Aug 10, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-10.4715429511
Dege Peak	Gjack	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Today was Dege Peak, we started at 7AM and got beautiful morning sun and no crowds. The trail is in great shape and the bugs were there but didn't land until we reached the top and then they didn't like Off bug spray. Lots of wild flowers and great views although it was a bit hazy with all the smoke.	Aug 10, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-10.8888029689
Shi Shi Beach and Point of the Arches	ChunkyMonkey	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	If hiking need a  Makah Indian Res Parking Recreation permit (good until the end of the year purchased). If backpacking need this permit plus a Backpacking permit. Can be picked up at the wilderness center in Port Angeles along with a bear canister. Note that wilderness permits are also available at the trailhead but fee must be mailed in.  No quota at Shi Shi. Driving directions correct. Once you arrive in Neah Bay, great signage. Two overnight parking options, one about 1/2 mi before the trailhead, the 2nd is a mile before the trailhead. Trailhead parking available. Vault potties at the trailhead. Most people were dropping off their hiking partnes and then going back to park the cars and walking to the trailhead. Trail is very well maintained. Pretty flat for the most part, several boardwalks and one cool bridge that goes up and then down, like the the top of a pyramid. After the boardwalks, trail is much flatter but still wet. Able to hike through without getting wet/muddy, but very passable. Some bugs in this area. Last section down the trail just before the beach has been recently updated. Several switchbacks, some sections with stairs, some just steep trail down.  Non-private primitive privy near the bottom of the steep sections. Made camp about 1/8 mi before Petroleum Creek. Creek was low, but able to walk behind the log jam and find water to filter. Camp site also on beach on a wide section and close to the tree line. Check tide tables. Stayed two nights and was able to spend quite a bit of time at Point of the Arches exploring the sea life and the cove past the Point. Encountered a coyote on Saturday. Rained a little both nights but great visit. Looking forward to another visit.	Aug 10, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-12.6312155103
Surprise and Glacier Lakes	Saynat78	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	We enjoyed our 2 night backpacking trip to Surprise Lake. Hiked to Glacier lake the second day. Not too crowded with backpackers, but that may have been due to the rain in the forecast.  Not sure why this hike only has 3 stars. We thought the views were beautiful on the trail and at the lakes. Lots of ripe blueberries and salmon berries to snack on on the way up or down. Trail is a little overgrown in some places, but overall in really good shape.  Bugs were an annoyance but not overwhelmingly bad. 	Aug 10, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-12.4646744917
Upper Dungeness River	jnlherdman	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Hiked in and stayed one night at Camp Handy with my 7 year old son. Missed the turn down to the campground off of Palo Alto Rd. There isn’t a sign marking the turn to the right. Got back on course and enjoyed a great day on the trail and an awesome night. There were plenty of spots around Camp Handy. We ended up choosing one right next to the river. Easy hike for younger children.

Evergreen Mountain Lookout	bradeyh	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	Hiked up on Friday night with the kids (ages 12, 10, and 7) for a night of stargazing. NF road 6554 up to the trailhead was in decent shape--no problem for our 2WD one-ton van, and I saw an '89 Corolla wagon up there alongside all of the pickup trucks. Trail was in good shape, with some ripe huckleberries (especially in the meadows farther up). Made it up in about an hour and a half, in time for a beautiful sunset through the smoke. Set up our tent next to the fire ring just below and to the NE of the lookout, which was closed for maintenance while we were there (a no campfires sign was also posted). The younger kids didn't manage to stay up long enough to see the stars, but a couple of us sat out and enjoyed them. Night was starry and clear with smoke on the horizon, but the Milky Way was out and visible all across the sky, along with a few meteors from the Perseid shower. Clouds and rain rolled in around 4 AM, and it was still foggy hiking out at 8:30.  Saw one pair of day hikers on their way down while we were going up, and got passed by a solo hiker who also overnighted at the top (farther down the ridge to the NE of the lookout) and headed out early. There were a couple more families heading up the next morning, and two other trucks still in the parking lot, but overall much less popular than I would have expected. The drive in is a bit long, but this is a great easy, short hike with awesome views that's still reasonably close. Only concern with very small children would be the steep grassy slopes to the east and south of the lookout. Looking forward to doing it again--would be great to overnight in the lookout when it's open.	Aug 10, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-11.5178469725
Lake Valhalla	outdoormama	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	This was my first time hiking this beautifully maintained trail.  We started at Smithbrook Trailhead where there is not a toilet.  The forest road didn't have any potholes miraculously, but was quite rough.  Thankfully we only had to drive on it for a couple miles.   We started out around 8:00a and it was 65degrees.  We only saw two other couples on our assent.  You do need to watch for the signs where you turn or you could really end up lost! We arrived at the lake around 10:00a and it was quite warm.  The lake was refreshing and beautiful.  There were a good amount of people (children and parents) camping up there and there are some really nice spots to set up camp.  There is a box toilet at the Lake, which we were grateful for. The way down there were A LOT of people going up (surprisingly) and we made it back to our car in about one hour. There are some narrow trails along drop-offs, but it is otherwise kid friendly.  I'm curious about hiking to the lake from the otherside and may try that another time.  	Aug 10, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-11.2890129259
Glacier Basin	WhirliesGirl	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Followed @Wild Side's June 19 post and biked the wagon road, fun to do a bike/hike. To get to the start of the wagon road drive about .7 miles on the gravel road past Barlow Pass to a clear trailhead on the right, although I don't think the sign there says anything about going to Monte Cristo. Another note, if you take this route you'll hit a T intersection in roughly 2 miles, go left here.  The trail to Glacier Basin is very brushy at first, then opens up a little. The rope isn't really necessary, I thought the sketchiest section was early on when the side hill was washed out and you have a short stint with a steep dropoff to one side. The creek is always within earshot on the way up but you don't get near it until the climb flattens out, a little frustrating on a hot day. Lots of berries on the trail but the ones we tried still need about a week to sweeten up. The basin is spectacular, we just peeked in but you could spend some quality time roaming around here.  Since we were biking much of the way I thought this would be relatively easy but it really was a tough one, the persistent rough trail and steep elevation takes its toll. Do bring more water than you think you'll need, we were all out by the time we got back to the car. 	Aug 10, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-11.6488497781
Mount Pilchuck	miomio143	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Keeping this short-  Did an overnighter, so started hiking up around 8 pm. Used headlamps, encountered many spiders and other critters on the way up. Hammocked in some trees, and wasn’t bothered by mosquitoes until morning, when they swarmed us. (Sunrise was amazing btw, the sun looked like a red fireball from wildfire smoke- refer to pic) Tons and TONS OF RIPE HUCKLEBERRIES!!! So many bushes loaded down, we picked for about a good half hour on our way down. The majority of ripe bushes are within the first 3/4 mile of the hike. Somebody go pick them!  One other note- there’s a day/camp site to the right of the trail near the registry? Never noticed it before but there’s a picnic table & fire pit off to the side.  Happy Trails!

PCT	skicat	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	My friend & I left our camp on the Bypass Trail & headed up towards the PCT. (We had hiked from the Snowgrass Trailhead 4 miles to our campsite the day before.) The bugs were pretty bad on this section. Once we got on the PCT, & were out in the open, the bugs werent too bad. The vistas werent as awesome as they could have been, the sky was a little hazy. but the wildflowers were in full bloom! Paint brush, bistort, & fields of pasque flowers. Cispus Basin was beautiful. We crossed a number of streams/waterfalls, so there was plenty of water. It was fun to meet some of the PCT thru hikers & chat with them. We continued past the Basin, up to Cispus Pass. It was hot, so we found a lunch spot with a view & a breeze. The bugs did not bother us while we were eating. We could not see Mt. Adams because of the haze. The trail was in great condition, dusty & dry, but no obstacles. We returned to our campsite, where the bugs were awful, for a RT distance of 7 miles.  It would be pretty long for a day hike from the Snowgrass Parking Lot, about 15 miles.

Grand Park via Lake Eleanor	Bubbalinc	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Great hike today. 3 cars were there when I got there at 9:30a. The WTA directions to the hike are good. However, on the hike itself, you’ll want to take the trail that goes left once you get to Eleanor Lake. It’s not signed. It’s an easy hike from Eleanor to the first meadow (small), and once you enter forest again after the small meadow, then there’s some climbs and small elevation. You could smell the smoke in the air and the views were hazy but still totally worth the moments. The large meadow is grand. Once you get to the trail intersection, I’d recommend taking the right trail (leading toward Jeremy Camp), because in 9 minutes, you’ll come upon the best lunch/picnic spot! It’s a bluff that looks into the mountain valley. Stunning.	Aug 10, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-13.5730241721
Twin Falls	Ryan_C	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	This hike was actually confusing for an avid hiker myself. We got to the trailhead at around noon. The lot was 95% full. The trail is well maintained, but there aren’t many signs indicating where you need to go. We missed the twin falls, kept going past a bridge, and proceeded up the John Wayne Trail Junction. I guess it was our fault for not looking at the map before heading on the trail. Just make sure you know where you’re going before you start. I will for sure be trying to do this hike again.	Aug 10, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-12.4758058335
Mirror and Cottonwood Lakes	ellieoutside	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Kinda smokey but me & my trusty dog hit up Mirror & Cottonwood Lakes. The forest service road is in pretty good shape just watch for a few washboard spots in the last 2 miles.Don’t attempt to drive to the trail last half mile no matter how high clearance your vehicles are. Park it & hoof it up the steep rocky boulder filled road. Gives you about 3.0 miles total. I got there about 1 & had no issues finding a parking spot. Make sure to look to your left for the pile of carins & the sign which is laying on them marking the trail  The hike itself starts in what feels almost overgrown path for just a few feet then opening up to a wider trail. It’s a steady climb up to the lakes. Just enough of a challenge. The trail is in great shape & ez to follow. Lots of opportunities for pups to grab a sip. This would be an awesome place for overnight backpack trip. I would do this again.	Aug 10, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-11.7967560148
Grand Pass	Stuke Sowle	Obstacles on trail:	    Trees down across trail,	    Muddy or wet trail,	    Overgrown in places.	This is a trip report for the Grand Loop as described in the Trekking Washington Book.  One of the more incredible loops I have taken in Washington State, I first did it in 2015 and decided it was time to visit the loop again.  This time I went in a CCW direction starting at Obstruction Point.  Most take three or four days to do the loop, but since I travel light, I am able to finish it in a day.  Regardless of your speed, it is a loop that I highly recommend for all. The Obstruction Point road is in great shape and while a bit "airy" in spots, it is one of the wider primitive roads in the state.  It is also one of the most scenic and it is hard at times to keep focused on driving with the sweeping panoramas around you!  There is a restroom at the trailhead parking lot and room for about 20 cars (more if folks are creative). I found the parking lot to be pretty full for a Friday morning but there were a couple of spots open.  Unlike most PNW routes, you start at a higher elevation on this one before working your way down.  I threw my running vest on and hit the trail at about 8:15 AM.  The smoke from the Hamma Hamma fires was thick enough to obscure the views of the more distant mountains and one could just make out Olympus through the haze. From Obstruction Point, I hopped onto the Grand Pass trail and followed this on some gentle rolling terrain for the first mile and a half.  Trail was in great shape with no snow present.  At the mile and a half mark, I made a deviation from the traditional loop, opting to take a right on a well established but unnamed trail that instead of dropping down to the lakes below, stays on the ridgeline above the lakes. It was a nice change of pace staying up high and looking down upon the lakes.  The trail is easy to follow, avoids any snowfields but does have some technical sections along with a couple of climbs, descents in scree.  About four miles in, it drops back down to the Grand Pass trail right before it begins it's climb to Grand Pass. This area is jaw dropping good and despite the smoke, it was still on this day as well.  The climb to the pass is snow free and there are multiple water sources in this section. You are rewarded for your work by climbing to Grand Pass and having even more views open up to you.  One can take a slight detour to Grand View Peak here if they so desire.   Then begins the first big drop of my day, from the Pass down to Cameron Creek, 2,100' below.  The trail switchbacks through the upper basin but once you hit the treeline, it basically drops straight down.  It is in pretty good shape but has some rough sections which is typical for this park.  There are multiple water sources along this descent and surprisingly, quite  few wildflowers remain.  Once I was at the junction with the Cameron Creek trail, I took a right traveling southwest.  Here the trail begins to climb again.  In years past, the first section after the junction would be pretty overgrown but someone has gone through and cleaned this up.  The climb is gradual, jumping from forested sections to meadows and waterfalls tumble down the flanks of the ridges surrounding you.  I came across a group of hikers near the junction but wouldn't see anyone again until some time later.  Solitude is something you can count on the Olympics for. This section like the climb to Grand Pass, is stunning.  As you climb the forest gives way to high alpine meadows with snow fed creeks that you rock hop across.  In the distance you can see Mount Cameron and your path leading to the pass.  The final 600' of climbing to the pass is on scree and rock, but the path is established and I had to cross only about 25 yards of snow that was unexposed.  No traction required.  From the pass you can look back on the path you have taken or view the Lost River valley.   I continued on into the basin that gives birth to the Lost River.  Tucked away, it's easy to see why it got it's name.  The trail is easy to follow through this alpine basin and ones gaze keeps returning to the mountains to the south and west of the trail. A sad, beat up sign marks Lost Pass and they you drop down a thousand feet in less than a mile to the Dosewallips River.  Here I was tempted to change my plans on the spot and take a right at the junction towards Hayden Pass and ultimately the Elwha, but decided that I should stay on course.   Taking a left on the Dosewallips Trail I began the trek to the Gray Wolf Pass Trail.  For about three and a half miles you follow the river downstream.  Here the trail has some rough overgrown sections and some blowdowns that you will have to get around. Bugs also made an appearance in this hot valley with some horseflies keeping me company for what seemed like miles.  I visited the shelter at Bear Camp for a few minutes to eat a snack and then kept trucking. The sign at the junction with Gray Wolf Pass is in terrible shape and I blew right by it, fortunate to notice it as I looked back over my shoulder.  Now began what felt like a grueling 3.5 mile climb from 3,700' to 6,200'.  The trail was right in the direct sunlight which didn't help matters.  This section also has quite a few blowdowns to get around but fortunately, several water sources as well.  Views of the opposing valley wall kept my mind off things and as I neared the pass, a cool breeze kicked up. At the pass another sad sign resides.  Seriously, some of these look as old as the park! Laid out to the north was the valley created by the Gray Wolf and in the far distance I could make out Blue Mountain above Deer Park. A long ways off!  Fortunately the next nine or so miles is a gradual downhill so after a quick break, I got back to it. Down you drop from the pass through more meadows and finally into the forest.  I finally came across another group of backpackers at Falls Camp and a second group not long after.   This trail has been recently worked on and I was thankful for this as my legs were starting to feel a bit worked at this point.  The moss covered boulders and thick tree cover on the lower section was quite the contrast to the wide open alpine I had been traveling not long before and I welcomed the cooler air.  But it's a long descent! Finally just as I was beginning to wonder if it would end, I found myself at Three Forks. There were quite a few groups camped here and at the shelter I loaded up with water as I couldn't remember much in the way of water sources from here on out. Now begins the climb out of the valley on the Three Forks trail.  The trail isn't too steep, climbing 3,000' in 4.3 miles and compared to some of the previous trails, it feels like a red carpet laid out before you. But at this point in the trip, it was definitely a chore as I passed 33 miles and 10,000' of gain for the day.  Unfortunately I had not been traveling as fast as I had planned so I just caught the tail end of the sunset as I broke out of the trees.  The smoke had cleared and the colors on the horizon were incredible. Now probably the hardest part of the journey, walking through Deer Park campground at dusk with everyone cooking up their favorite food! I was envious as I gulped down another gel shot but I was on the home stretch.  Fortunately I found a trickle of a water source near the ranger cabin and loaded up before hitting Deer Ridge, Obstruction Point Ridge...whatever it is called.  Now the sun was down, headlamp came out and I made my way along the trail as it dropped down and then back up.  To my right you would get glimpses of the lights of Port Angeles.  I had forgotten just how much the trail climbs but eventually you wind your way up to almost 6,600' along the ridge.  My views now were just what my headlamp cast light on and the stars above.  But the trail is in good shape and there was no snow to deal with. Eventually I could pick out lights in the Obstruction Point Parking lot and after a quick descent, I found myself wandering into the parking lot 15 hours after I started. Totals, 42 miles and 13k of gain.  A strenuous but rewarding day! 	Aug 10, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-11.7661678355
Ruby Beach	MaryJ	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	I actually just stopped here to check it out. Didn't walk any further than the beach. Next time!!! But wanted to write this anyways to say it looked like a great place to bring kids!!! So much exploring!! They were walking in the water and I heard so much excitement. Lots of driftwood too for climbing. The walk is short to the beach. Parking lot was packed so people were parking on the driveway in. There are restrooms.

Tonga Ridge / Mount Sawyer	Viewseeker	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Thank you for the trail marker for Mt. Sawyer!! The first part of that trail is rough but after about 100 feet it is much gentler.  We found a small Nikon lens cap on the trail near the top of Mt. Sawyer. If it's your let me know and I'll mail it to you! Berries were delicious. Biting bugs were there but bearable. There were lots of butterflies on the flowers and a few bumblebees too.  Views were better than expected with all the smoke in the air. We could see the base of Glacier Peak, but couldn't see Baker or Rainier at all (I've seen all 3 of the mountains on a previous time on Mt. Sawyer. 	Aug 10, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-10.1000500130
Ira Spring Trail - Mason Lake	Dynamic Tension	Obstacles on trail:	    Trees down across trail.	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were terrible	Hiked from the Ira Spring trailhead past Mason Lake and on to Mount Defiance. As usual, the trail to Mason Lake is in fine shape. The signage for "Main trail" and for Defiance is good, so you are unlikely to get lost. The trail up to Defiance is mostly good, but a few trees are down over the trail and one in particular manages to block the trail in three places. A little clambering is required. The last steep pitch up to the summit is really, well, steep. Bugs harried me at various points along the trail and the Defiance summit was absolutely teeming with them. I managed to eat half a sandwich when they got distracted for a few minutes, but it was pretty bad. Hardly any bugs by Mason Lake, though, which was super nice. Soaked in the lake for a while on the way back down. Mason Lake felt warm, if you can believe it. Lots of other people on the trail today, even on Defiance. Parking lot had at least 14 cars by 9:00. Lots more when I got back around 3:00. Never felt crowded while hiking, though.	Aug 10, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-10.6342137518
Ira Spring Trail - Mason Lake	fina	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	This hike checks a lot of boxes: lake, mountain summit, wildflowers, ripe berries, and relatively close to Seattle. The trail was moderately busy on this Friday morning. The road in had some potholes, but nothing our Toyota Camry couldn't handle. It's a long, tough climb to the top of Bandera Mountain but it's worth it, and it would have been even more worth it without the haze that obscured some of the view. Still, the summit was very impressive. You can see down to Mason Lake, which is also a worthy destination. The water was a fantastic temperature, cool enough to be refreshing but won't make you scream when you get in. There are also tons of ripe huckleberries along the exposed part of the trail to Mason Lake. Most of the wildflowers are done blooming, but there's still lots of indian paintbrush and the bear grass stems still look cool. It was also a good day for wildlife - saw lots of birds, butterflies, a pika at the summit, and salamander. There were a few bugs but I don't appear to have any bites. I'd love to come back here again, hopefully dressed to swim and when it's a bit clearer. (The bottom picture is PeakFinder's representation of what we would have seen without all the smoke and clouds.)

Melmont Ghost Town	Hiking Nerds	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	We did this hike on a Friday afternoon and it was not crowded at all. The weather was perfect and even though it's mid August there was just a little mud in a couple of places. I'm sure it can get quite messy. We accessed the trail from the north side of the bridge(this is not marked and was a little bit confusing) and used the cables to get down to the well maintained trail. The ruins we spotted along the way made what would have been a nice trail even better. It was fun to imagine the history in this remote spot. Nice, easy hike I would recommend for anyone!

Tolmie Peak Lookout - Eunice Lake	BiancaS	Minor obstacles posing few problems	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	Wonderful hike up to Tolmie Peak. I'd say an amazing award for a rather short hike. It's pretty steep though. You start at this gorgeous Mowich Lake and also pass another lake, Eunice Lake (you can go for a swim). It's a pretty busy trail! Dogs are not allowed. You need a pass, which you can get at the ranger station close by (opens at 7:30)	Aug 10, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-10.8685517315
Evans Creek Preserve	EmilB	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	We arrived at the lower 224th parking lot just after 1 PM on a sunny Friday.  The lot was fairly full, but many of the spots were taken by vans associated with some organized outing for children.  You don't need a paper trail map because all intersections have map placards that indicate where you are and numbered arrows indicating near trail intersections (as is the custom with City of Sammamish parks); you will not get lost. The initial stretch of trail was abuzz with people; many adults in addition to the swarms of children.  But, the high traffic appears limited to the meadow.  We hiked P->1->2->3->4->5->8->10->11->12->15->1->P and as soon as we got into the "Woodland Trails" we saw no one (see PDF map additional link).  I'm guessing the "Hill Trails" are similarly unpopulated. Some of the other trail reports document folks walking dogs off-leash.  The City seems to be cracking down on that.  The lot and trails are plastered with menacing signs declaring "This is not an off-leash dog park!" and threatening tickets.  Given that the City of Sammamish enforcing park rules, you are at much great risk of a ticket here than at County parks (where only a Sheriff's deputy can ticket you).  Also, although this park has some running water, it's nothing a dog could immerse itself in.  So, if you want to walk a dog off-leash, you are much better off just going to Marymoor. This is a good park for locals and King County park completionists, but isn't anything special.  The map is littered with "Scenic Viewpoints" which falsely suggest there might be something interesting to see.  One such viewpoint was completely surrounded in 8 ft tall blackberry brambles; you couldn't see more than 10 feet in front of you.

Lake Caroline	Mr. Ochkarik	Obstacles on trail:	    Trees down across trail,	    Muddy or wet trail.	Road rough but passable	Had to be back home by 9 am this morning, so changed up plans and made a quick, early morning hike to Lake Caroline. Got on the trail about 10 after 4 am. Eightmile road is in much better shape than last month thanks to recent grading. It is still not the smoothest forest road in the world, so low clearance vehicles need to be careful in places. Any car should be able to make it up just fine. It was already in the high 60's when I started and probably high 70's/low 80's when I got back to the truck. This made for a somewhat uncomfortable hike since much of the trail is without cover. Also, the conditions were quite dry and the switchbacks up from Little Eightmile Lake were dusty and rocky. The trail is in decent shape. The only obstacles you have to deal with from the TH to Little Eightmile is a few muddy patches. From the trail spur to Caroline, there are 10 trees down. Two of those can't be easily stepped over. The wildflowers are past peak, but there is quite a bit of fireweed on the first half of the trail. As you start climbing to Lake Caroline, you start to see a bunch of paintbrush and (I think) subalpine daisy. If you like thimbleberry, then you are in luck. There are a bunch of ripe berries between the TH and Little Eightmile Lake. No sleep 'til Brooklyn and no bugs 'til Caroline. But at Lake Caroline, the bugs were an annoyance. I didn't get any bites, but they sure made it unpleasant. I didn't see anyone on the trail until the way back when I crossed paths with two trail runners just after Little Eightmile Lake. Those were the only two I saw until the parking lot. It is always a treat when you pretty much have the trail to yourself. Skies were pretty smoky but not as bad as they were back in Wenatchee. I hardly noticed it at all and it didn't seem to affect my breathing significantly. Overall, not a bad little backup hike.

Home Lake	jlark21	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Beautiful smokey hike, took us about 6 hours in the heat of the day from Upper Dungeness.  The lake does not have many camp sites, but even fewer people so it all worked out ok. Weather turned quickly on Saturday and we got soaked summiting Constance Pass, and decided to pack up and head out instead of be damp for another 24 hours.

Mount Teneriffe	Boulderdash457	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	My hiking partner and I, both young men in decent shape, set out from the Teneriffe trailhead at 7:45 AM on Friday morning, reached the summit at 11:00 AM, stayed at the top for about twenty minutes, and returned to the trailhead by 2:00 PM, for a total hiking time of about six hours. We saw one other hiker on the trail in the whole trip. The trail itself is in excellent condition, with no fallen trees or unstable ground. There is some overgrowth of thorny plants, but it can be easily avoided. The view from the top would have been great if not for the heavy smoke hanging over the area. The only serious problems with this hike was the abundance of bugs. Horseflies followed us both ways over most of the distance between the 3.5 mile mark and the peak. At the peak itself, we were swarmed by small, non-biting flies.	Aug 10, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-12.2618184376
Sourdough Mountain	Keith T	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	Very cool hike with great views, though it was smoky so it could've been better. The bugs were very persistent and would find any area I hadn't sprayed. The hike itself was a good challenge - it starts off pretty steep but becomes more reasonable after a while. It took me about 7 hours total. The heat was pretty rough in the afternoon; in total I think I drank 5-5.5 liters. I only brought 4 so the rest came from a filter and melting some snow at the top. The stream near the start turned out to be a great place to soak my feet after. Oh also there was some bear poop near the top, so they're around.

Franklin Falls	Ky Carter	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	My Mom and I stopped on our way up to Lake Kachess for camping to do a quick 2 mile round trip hike to Franklin Falls. I was a easy hike with not much elevation gain, and would be a perfect family hike, you'd just have to watch closely right at the falls as it is a little rocky getting down. Would be treacherous in the winter, but wasn't too bad at all this time of year. 	Aug 10, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-11.6094107863
Lila Lake	Backwoods Betty	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	This is the second time I've done this hike, both times as an overnight; the only difference being the first time I had my dog and we hike up both Alta and to Lila lake from Rampart and back in a day. This time I was a bit less ambitious. Though my faded memories served me well that this is a hike worthy of a repeat!  We hiked in Friday at 10am. Its an arduous haul with gear in the heat, but there are lots of water crossing the last half which make much more bearable. There were plenty of great campsites to be found at Ramparts and we picked a nice open one with great views of the lakes, but the wind picked up in late afternoon so to avoid the dust storm we relocated a bit lower.  We swam after setting up camp which felt amazing!  Then day hiked to Lila lakes; which were gorgeous!  We hung out with some pikas and butterflies, then came back to camp and hunkered down. We woke up to rain and misty fog rolling through. Luckily it stopped before we started packing up and heading out.  Then we got to car and it started pouring!  Timing is everything!

Railroad Grade	Scratch_That_Hiking_Itch	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	First time up Railroad Grade, and what a time it was! Started up the trail about 6am Friday, 20 cars at the lot. Most must have gone to Park Butte or elsewhere because I didn't see enough people to warrant even half of that. You must pack your own human/dog waste out, but the blue bags were gone. Luckily I had some doggy bags... I took the wrong way at the 2 mile mark, turned right instead of left. After carrying my pup across a suspension bridge (too scary for her), I realized I was going in the wrong direction, and immediately had to cross it again. Set up at a sweet spot not far from a running creek, though I'm not sure how much longer it will be running. It was very low. Take note of this, as you will have to walk the trail back more than half a mile to get water from the established  First hike I've done in a month where the bugs werent too bad. A couple bites, but if you stop on the trail you aren't getting attacked. Some flowers in the meadows, birds aplenty! Next time up I'll venture to high camp, and see how close I can get before wimping out. On the way out i went to 5 Bs bakery in Concrete, great cinnamon rolls! 	Aug 10, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-11.7841128141
Silver Peak	Birdman	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	No bugs	Snow free	Hiked into Silver Peak via the PCT and Silver Peak trail. Very little haze, and a great respite from the heat of eastern WA. The road has some very rough spots but cars are getting to the trailhead. The trail is rocky on the final approach to the summit but very doable. Munched on berries and enjoyed some nice wild flowers. 6.8 miles, 2200'.

Scott Paul Trail	Auntie	Minor obstacles posing few problems	Road rough but passable	No bugs	Snow free	Things to know from Friday August 10 hike: take poles, prepare for challenging stream crossings. No bugs. No haze or smoke. Gorgeous wildflowers!! Lots of whistle-pigs! This is one of my favorite hikes. Walked in reverse of suggested route. This made uphill climb shady, less steep & much mellower, and downhill more knee-jarringly steep, which can be a tripping hazard if you are tired at the end of the hike.  I took my mid-size, strong dog: heeler-shepherd mix. There was plenty of water for him along the route, but took some extra anyway since it's not always readily available. There were  , especially with a dog. It was a hot & sunny day, with lots of roiling glacial melt. The first one (remember this is in reverse from guidebooks) I had to lift, drag, push him through deep and strongly churning pools.   could have crossed by myself without getting wet, but we both got soaked. The second challenging stream crossing was at the moraine, right before the hanging bridge 	Aug 10, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-11.0000191800
Park Butte	Lukin66	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	This is about the perfect time to visit Park Butte! The trail is in great shape, no snow to cross and no bugs. The only improvement would be ripe berries, but they are still a ways off especially at higher elevation. The crossing at Rocky Creek was very easy, and the ascent into Morovitz and Shreibner's meadows was breathtaking as always.  It was somewhat quiet at the lookout, and I managed to have it to myself for almost a whole hour while I ate lunch. On the way back I stopped at the tarns for a bit, and then hightailed it back down. It was hot, but with a stiff enough breeze that I only got a tiny amount of smoky haze.  A note on the road: It is in no worse shape than it has been in years past. There are potholes, but they are easily avoided. In fact, the sketchy washout on FS13 has been repaired! I've driven this road in a hatchback, a sedan, and a Toyota Rav-4. Anyone can make it up with a little bit of common sense. 	Aug 10, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-11.1203796463
Annette Lake	Sandy	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Hiked with my Aussie and carrying my 1 year old along with our friend and her little who was also in a carrier. Arrived at 9:30 am, plenty of parking! Drove my sedan there, road was fine! Started hike at 9:45 am, arrived at the lake at 12:05. Saw some bear scat on the trail on the way up, my Aussie was packing our bear bell and I do carry bear spray, please hike prepared! We also had plenty of noise from our littles ;) several people commented on her “cow bell” guess they don’t carry a bear bell :O Found a nice spot for my Aussie to swim and our kiddos to splash. Water was perfect temperature to rest our feet! Trail was pretty quiet, we were passed by a handful of people.  Someone was flying a drone over the lake which is super annoying. Bugs were not too bad, a few flies bothered us while having lunch.  Headed back down at 1 pm, took us 1 hour 45 minutes. Saw more people on the way up, hot time of day to hike!  Parking lot was still quite empty. Was a great day to hike with our babes! 	Aug 10, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-11.2114361315
Grand Park via Lake Eleanor	EnjoyingGodsCreation	Obstacles on trail:	    .	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Arrived at trailhead by 1 in the afternoon. There were about 5 cars parked. The road up is really not bad, just have to avoid a few potholes. About a 30 min walk to the lake. Quite a few flies at the lake but not horrible. There was a breeze almost the whole time which likely kept the bug issue to a minimum. Only got a couple mosquito bites. After leaving the lake there is a small meadow you walk through that had some wildflowers. From the lake to the park it took us about an hour to get to the “start” of grand park. Grand park itself had pretty much zero wildflowers. And with the haze right now mount rainier wasn’t as spectacular as it normally is. It was a nice hike, but will have to do again.

Poo Poo Point - Chirico Trail	CapnCrumples	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Arrived at trailhead around 6:30PM and there were several parking spaces.  We watched some paragliders land then headed up.  Hilly as expected, but short and beautiful; the views were great even with the smoke. Only passed maybe 10-15 people.  There were people running up and down the trail with no problem, but I managed to slip and fall on the loose rocks a few times on the way down 🤦‍♀️.

Twin Falls	GoodKarma	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	It's been many years since I last hiked to Twin Falls, and there have been some changes to the trail.  In particular, there is a viewpoint at the top of the first ridge that has some benches and a nice view of the falls from a way downriver.  I think that is a nice addition. The trail was in pretty good condition throughout, but if you are a novice, be aware that you will go up over a first ridge (to the viewpoint) and then decend back to the river level before climbing again to the level of the falls.  That's more up and down than a quick glance at the map would lead you to believe.   As you near the falls, be sure to take the spur down from the main trail.  It is all stairs down to a platform, so some people pass on it, not wanting to climb back up.  But know that the view from the platform is unforgettable.  It is truly a beautiful waterfall, with lots of flow even in this dry summer.

Mailbox Peak	PNWNomad	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	This trail is beautiful the entire way up! Incredible forest,  geology and big mountain views. However, today was pretty noticeably smokey. We smelled smoke the whole time and it clouded out views of Mt. Rainier, to our dismay. There were plenty of dogs on the trail, and the summit is safe as long as you keep an eye/leash on them. The elevation gain feels very manageable until the last half mile when it becomes a slog to the mailbox. It was tough to get up the last leg and the entire downhill felt incredibly long, but it was an excellent day in the woods!  Side note: drive down Middle Fork Road a little further and pull off to stick your feet in the river after a hot hike! 	Aug 10, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-10.9693586360
Pinnacle Peak	HaiHoangTran	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were terrible	Snow free	This was my first time doing this hike and I didn’t know what to expect or to look for. I arrived at the trailhead at about 5:30 AM and there were a few cars in the parking lot but they were there to photograph Reflection Lake. I was the first one on the trail and didn’t see anyone on the trail until I got back to the trailhead a bit before 8 AM. There were quite a few more people preparing to start the hike. I would say that this was one of the most scenic hikes I’ve been on in western Washington. There were many picturesque meadows and it’s like everywhere you turn, you get a great view of Mt. Rainier. This trail offers some really great sights and is relatively easy to accomplish. It seems like the trail was a constant climb from start to end. Even so, the elevation gain was gradual and very manageable. Towards the end, the trail does get a good bit steeper but the distance isn’t too bad. Trail condition was fine when I went. No snow or anything that would be unexpected. There was a surprising amount of fine loose dirt that seems more like sand on the trail. This is also one of those trails that have small loose rock chips. Be mindful of these things because they can make the ground a bit slippery and unbalanced. When walking on the trail, I saw a few small man made moving water streams but only had to actually do a water crossing once. There were plenty of rocks to step on so if you don’t want to get wet, you don’t have to as this was extremely easy to navigate. The only thing that I have to complain about is the number of bugs on the trail. Mosquitos were EVERYWHERE, from the parking lot to end. Do yourself a favor and get some bug spray! So I have to admit, I don’t know if I actually finished this hike and saw Pinnacle Peak. I know that I definitely walked at least the 1.3 miles stated on the trailhead sign but didn’t really know what I should be looking at. The pictures that most people post on this hike definitely doesn’t help because most turn around and take a picture of Mt. Rainier (I'm also guilty of this). When I got back to the trailhead, I saw the information sign and think that Pinnacle Peak is the pointy spire, so take a look at that if you need to know what to look for. Overall, this a quite an enjoyable hike. It’s relatively short and easy to accomplish yet offers great scenery. This is definitely a recommended hike! P.S. I just noticed on WTA that there is both a Pinnacle Peak and Pinnacle Saddle hike. Are they different? The trailhead sign mentions both names so I'm unsure if they are the same thing or not.

Denny Creek	Tkbcampers	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	Just a quick trip out today with wife and pup. Arrived after 12 and found parking along the road. Not too crowded thankfully. Trail was very dry and dusty but the walk up to the water play area was all shaded and mostly quiet.  The river crossing was pretty overrun with kids as expected. We quickly past on by and headed uphill. The trail pops in and out of sun but is dry and dusty the whole way. Some nice people told us about the boot trail down to Keekwulee Falls. Glad they did. We spent a good hour here having lunch and watch the dog play. Water was cool and felt great to rest our feet and rinse the dirt off.  Leaving the falls we explored the canyon a little bit and then decided to head back. Past a few overnighters heading out to Melakwa. Was a quick jaunt down for a stop in North Bend for dinner. 	Aug 10, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-10.4753772019
Ira Spring Trail - Mason Lake	BiancaS	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	What an amazing hike to Mason Lake, had a good rest at the lake, dipped our feet into the refreshing water, had lunch and headed back. We got encourage by some people who we met along the hike, to hike up to the summit of little Bandera mountain. This is an aggressive hike up but so worth it, the views are just breathtaking. The very steep hike up is about 1/2 mile but feels like more! My dog was with me and this was the last time I took my dog on a long hike like that. It was too much, the air was too thin and it was just too strenuous. I put him in my backback and carried him down, he was pooped. :-( Please remember if you take your dog, if you let them walk without a leash, they will hike double the mileage than yourself, because they tend to run back and forth etc. if you take your dog, bring enough water and give your dog enough rest.

Rattlesnake Ledge	JRhikes	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	If you want a little solitude on Rattlesnake hit the trail at 4:30 in the morning. My son and I hiked it this morning to watch the sunrise. It’s a good trail to walk in the dark since it’s so well used and obvious to follow. Just don’t expect to be alone for long. By the time the sun came up there were 25 other people at the top with us.	Aug 10, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-10.5572555642
Kendall Peak	HusbandWifePuppy	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Ran up to Kendall Peak today- the scramble itself is about .3 mile and 650 feet of gain. The approach to the scramble is gradual and nice for running. Round trip mileage was actually 11 miles, noted on two different GPS devices. You do not need a rope for the scramble. It exposed, but no need for equipment in the summer. Enjoy!	Aug 10, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-10.3181853530
Cedar River Trail	karnage	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Started out for a run at Cedar River Park.  There was a small fire up on the ridge above the trail, so it was smoky and we had to dodge some emergency vehicles.  Once we passed the flames, the air was much clearer.  The paved trail is great for strollers and we jogged to the first traffic light, which put us right at 2 miles.  Walked the two back to the kids with the kids out of the stroller so we all got some exercise.  There are some blackberries that are ripening along the sides! #hikeathon	Aug 10, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-10.0075781332
Cape Flattery	brooke christensen	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Short little detour after an overnighter at Shi Shi Beach just almost next door. This was a cute little hike through the meadows to the west most point in the contingent US. There are a ton of trail braids so choose a path (I do not support trail braiding, however these are already established braids - unfortunately). I did go on a little braid that led next to cape flattery point where a rope was tied to a tree and kind of repelled down to the water. Hike to the point is downhill; hike back is uphill; however it's like a stroll in the park! 	Aug 10, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-15.4416356314
Grand Park via Lake Eleanor	Bubbalinc	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Great hike today. 3 cars were there when I got there at 9:30a. The WTA directions to the hike are good. However, on the hike itself, you’ll want to take the trail that goes left once you get to Eleanor Lake. It’s not signed. It’s an easy hike from Eleanor to the first meadow (small), and once you enter forest again after the small meadow, then there’s some climbs and small elevation. You could smell the smoke in the air and the views were hazy but still totally worth the moments. The large meadow is grand. Once you get to the trail intersection, I’d recommend taking the right trail (leading toward Jeremy Camp), because in 9 minutes, you’ll come upon the best lunch/picnic spot! It’s a bluff that looks into the mountain valley. Stunning.	Aug 10, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-15.2725881971
Skyline Trail Loop	Bob and Barb	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	We hiked the Skyline Trail to Panorama Point. The shortcut trail is closed because of a hazardous snow crossing so we took the High Skyline Trail and had lunch at the high point of the trail. From there we continued on the loop and took the Golden Gate Trail back to the parking lot. Flowers are past their prime.

Windy Trail 216E	BeaverDawg	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	We came up last year at this time and thought it would be an amazing place to be for the Perseid AND get some miles for the H-A-T,  #hikeathon.  So we headed up on Friday with our packs.  All of the trails we traversed were in great shape.  It's apparent that trail work has been done on the lower/treed section of the Ape Canyon trail, as sections of trail are outlined by dead branches . We hiked in Friday morning from the Ape Canyon TH, in pretty warm weather.  There were some flies on the way up that liked to run into your face, they didn't seem to bite unless you stopped.  We had no issues with bugs after that, including the return trip through the same area on Sunday.   We enjoyed some limited shade at Ape Creek with a few other folks, 2 day hikers who started from the TH at the same time as us, and a couple who were finishing the Loowit.  It was while we were enjoying a break at the creek that the first of the   racers came through (actually just one guy, it took a while for the next racer to appear).   The creek is running much lower and therefore warmer than this time last year.  We were able to collect sufficient water and moved down the trail to make camp .  We watched runners pass by all afternoon/evening and into Saturday morning-headlamps ablaze.  Coyotes began sounding off shortly after sunset, making us wonder what the racers thought as they ran toward these sounds in the dark? Saturday brought the forecasted "chance of showers".  The mountain was socked in but the morning wasn't too bad, just brief showers off and on and a breeze. As we hiked from the pumice plains toward Windy Ridge w  By the end of the day we felt like we were a part of the race ourselves as we collected a few missed markers ("a part" the easy way- we didn't have to run or stay up all night).  Okay so back to our hike, we had not done the section from the plains to Windy Ridge before so this is new to us- part of it is a very cool ridge walk, it was socked in so we couldn't really see much around us but it was cool anyway.   We joined the Loowit trail, then the trail to Loowit Falls.   Just as we got to the end of the trail at the falls, it began to sprinkle so on went the rain jackets again and we headed back.  We returned to the plains via the Loowit over Windy Pass (another section we'd not done before).  We hiked in and out of the rain, fortunately it was intermittent and there was a breeze so we were able to dry out between showers.  The heavier showers came later after we were back at camp.... We returned to camp and were able to batten down the hatches before the rain set in again. We spent the rest of the afternoon in and out of the tent as the rain came and went.   Since the forecast for Sunday was for clearer skies we set the alarm clock for midnight in hopes of catching some of the meteor shower.  The alarm sounded and  , it was clear!  Oh yeah!  So we got to see what we came for, aside from the always-amazing scenery, a starry night sky! We didn't stay out too long, an hour or so, before fog rolled back in but we saw some decent shooting stars and took some photos.  Sunday morning started off with a nice clear view of the mountain but had deteriorated by the time we packed up at 9:am. We hiked out in socked-in conditions.  There were several groups camped at Ape Creek as we passed through, the creek even lower than it was on Friday. On the lower half of the trail we spoke to a volunteer from Mt. St. Helens Institute who was heading up to check things out and make sure people were okay.  Traffic on  Sunday included some day hikers but the majority of the folks heading up were mountain bikers.   . #hikeathon	Aug 10, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-13.7803957712
North Fork Skokomish River and Flapjack Lakes	danzhikes	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Hit the trail at 930a on Friday morning.  Parking lot had few cars in it.  Trail was great.  Took our time and made it to the Lake around 130p. Marker for the Flapjack turnoff was a bit tricky because the trail going up looks more like a scramble at first than a trail.  If you continue straight, you will end up at Black & White lakes.  Bugs were not bad at all.  Biggest problem was bees. We were stung a few different times throughout the 3 days while on the trail up to and around the lakes.  Quite smoky and Saturday/Sunday socked in with clouds.  Did not get to hike the divide trail.  Made it most of the way to Smith Lake but it was raining so hard the trail became treacherous and we turned around.  Fishing was fantastic.  I was very disappointed at the number of people who disregarded signs and the established camping sites and placed their tents wherever they thought would give them the best views of the lake.  Restoration areas will never be restored with tents and feet all over them.  No Rangers the entire weekend.  	Aug 10, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-13.2528396678
Navaho Pass	Weston4	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	With 3,000 feet elevation gain, I knew this was going to be a challenge for me and my son, but we gave it a shot anyways.  The trails climbs almost the whole way - I am not kidding!  We only made it up to the trail junction before we made camp.  The junction is approximately 4 miles and 2,200 feet elevation from the trail head.  There were a couple spots along the way for water, with a good spot 50 feet to the left at the junction. I talked with a couple hikers who said the view from Navaho pass was beautiful.  One said the round trip distance is ~1 mile longer than stated on the WTA website - you've been warned.

Dege Peak	mghn	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	Arrived to Sunrise by 8:30 am and the parking lot still had plenty of space. The hike to Dege Peak took about an hour each way. It was very warm, we were happy to start early. Lots of butterflies and bugs. Good hike for kids. Stayed for a picnic lunch and visited the visitor center. Parking lot was full by noon.	Aug 10, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-11.0435639740
Cape Flattery	MaryJ	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Oops, I didn't realize I needed a pass. I've been there several times throughout the years. Anyway, I got there early and I was the only one in the parking lot. I was happy about that. I was alone at the end of the trail for the amazing views!! It was so serene not to hear anything but the sound of the ocean!! Loved it!! Quite easy walk, just have to watch your footing on some of the boards. As I was leaving people were strolling in. Told them I knocked down the cobwebs for them. Lol. 	Aug 10, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-11.1657966460
Cutthroat Pass via the Pacific Crest Trail	Chelan Hiker	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	This is a great hike to meet PCT through-hikers on their final push.  It was a hot and hazy day in the North Cascades, but this hike was great.  The round trip to Cutthroat Pass is around 10 miles with 2,000 feet of elevation grain, but it goes quickly on this well-graded and well-maintained trail.  A west wind greeted us on our descent, which hopefully will start pushing out the haze soon.

Tatoosh Lookout	Patrick B.	Minor obstacles posing few problems	Road rough but passable	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	The trail wasn't Mt. Rose-level steep, but for the first maybe 1.5 miles, it's all uphill switchbacks. You ascend quickly. Afterward, you reach alpine meadows, which continue with intermittent groupings of trees providing brief shade all the way to the former lookout site. There is one large and a couple of small rock-slides that can pose problems (especially coming down, when one's legs are more fatigued), but if you plan out how to cross them, they shouldn't be too daunting. As for the lookout site itself, nothing remains except the concrete bases on top of which the structure used to be built, which function well as a place to sit and enjoy the view/recover from the hike. There's also a small brass marker from the U.S. National Forest Service designating the lookout site. There's a trail (possibly the Tatoosh Ridge trail; I don't know) continuing on past the site to a nearby ridge; I opted out of it, as the views from the lookout site were perfectly fine. Of particular note, other than Mt. Rainier, is a very picturesque tarn mostly covered by ice, slowly running off in a small rivulet (Google Maps tells me the lat/long for the tarn is 46.707992, -121.664262.) We didn't hike the trail (161B) headed up to the Tatoosh Lakes, only the trail headed up to the former lookout site (161A), so I can't say anything about that trail, but the sign is visible, if a bit faded. As you get very roughly 3 miles in (Google Maps says 46.706370, -121.680921), there will be a weird four-way intersection, with one path heading straight up the ridge to your left and another path headed down the ridge to your right. Take neither; continue forward to keep on 161A. On the hike up, you might see a sign nailed to a tree at the bend of the switchback in the meadow section. This is the 4.5-mile mark. The sign will say "Trail Abandoned," and we didn't explore further, but I imagine that it might be fun to see where it led.  The bugs. Oh boy, let's talk about the bugs. So, as conventional wisdom goes, bugs are most active around mid-morning and late afternoon, right after sunup and right before sundown. Because of the length and the incline of the hike, you'd have to time it so that you reach the trail-head at around 11:00 a.m. to make it up and down without hitting either of those two times, and you'd have to move at a fairly quick rate (we didn't; it took us 6 hours, including a 30-min break at the site) to pull it off. Of course, this ends up being the hottest time of day to hike. If you don't want to melt in August heat, you'll have a small cloud of flies following you pretty much the whole time. I doused myself with OFF (shout-outs to DEET), so the second they landed, they flew off immediately, but if you didn't bring bug spray, the hike won't be fun.  Overall 8.5/10 Your quads will hate you going up, your knees and shins will hate you going down. Fun all the way.

Barclay Lake	NQG Hikers	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	We arrived at the TH at 11 am and had no trouble finding a parking spot.  The trail is in great shape throughout.  The temperature was pleasant (low 70s) and the trail shady most of the way, so we had no issue with heat.  We've done this hike many times and we've never seen the lake so low or all of the rivers and streams dry.  It's still a very pretty, easy hike with stunning mountain views, but it was a bit hazy today, so the mountain views were not as clear as on our previous hikes.  We didn't have any issue with bugs anywhere along the trail, which was a welcome relief from our other hikes during the past month or so.   This hike is popular with groups and families.  As we were leaving, we passed a number of groups heading to the lake for an overnight stay.  All in all a pleasant, easy hike with great scenery.  	Aug 10, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-10.0996420052
Blanca Lake	Ted Nugent	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Friday August 10th day hike.  Reached the "trailhead" at 9:30am, 12 other cars. Got up to the old trailhead in 40 minutes. Horse flies are an annoyance on this section. But also look for ripe thimbleberry all up and down the road.  From there I made to the lake in 2 hours taking a minimal water/photo breaks. Plently of ripe huckleberry to pick along the switchbacks. Although the lake is mind-jarringly phenomenal due to its color, my favorite section is actually the subalpine areas just prior to Virgin Lake. Outstanding views of all three peaks that surround Blanca, also even though its hazy from wildfire smoke, you could still see Glacier Peak pretty good.  Spent 50 minutes at Blanca, its pretty unreal, I have to say the most beautiful body of water I have ever seen.  2 hours and 25 minutes all the way back to the truck. This is a long one, I have no tech gear but my body is saying maybe around 12 miles RT/3900 feet of gain all said and done.  I recommend trek poles, boots, 2-3 liters of water, sunscreen and a sun hat, and a nw forest pass at the minimum. A lot of this trail is steep, rooty and rocky. Not Balboa.  Lastly I saw one robin, one snake, lots of fat bumblebees, a bikini party, some campers, and roughly 10-12 other day hikers on trail. Zero bluetooth speakers! 	Aug 10, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-10.5487677959
Lord Hill Regional Park	ninjaracerchick	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Put in some miles on the trails. Examining trees, saying hi to frogs, and what not haha. All the trails we went on today were in great shape, no downed trees or muddy areas. Everyone was friendly, as it usually is. Did see a bit of glass in the parking lot, so just like the hiking trails be sure not to have desirable things in your car. Make sure to take a picture of the trail map when you head out, then you will be able to navigate the maze in a loop fashion!

Granite Mountain	BillyWan	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	We started our hike on a Friday at 6:48 am to beat the heat and traveled light (no heavy camera gear or too much extra stuff). It was 65 degrees at the trailhead and we were soon perspiring freely even though the first couple of miles are completely shaded. I consumed 2.5 liters of water and tea during the hike and would recommend taking lots of fluids as the hike is very exposed once you leave the tree line. Fortunately, we had a light breeze and made it to the lookout in 2 hours and 38 minutes. We were the first party of the day and after lunch the ranger, who is renovating the lookout, invited us up to visit the L-4 cabin and chat about historic fire lookouts, of course. He was incredibly friendly and fun to talk to. We set out for Granite Mountain Lookout because we just didn’t have time for Kaleetan Peak, which is not to say it is in any way a second choice from a quality perspective. I love this hike. It’s easily accessible and provides a high-quality mountain experience. Even though today the skies were still really hazy from distant forest fires you could easily see the nearby peaks, Kaleetan, Chair Peak and the Tooth. The trail, although dry and dusty is in great shape. People say it’s a hike that kicks your butt no matter how fit you are. I agree, but never-the-less it remains one of my favorite hikes. I will definitely come again, and again. I think it really shines in the spring (when there is still snow but the avalanche danger is gone) and the fall when you’ll see the fiery colors of that season, and when hopefully the skies will be clear and crisp.

Iron Goat Trail	AlBuck	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Beautiful morning for hike up to Windy Point and the Iron Goat Trail. Decided to start hike at the Interpretive center and do Windy Point first to get the climb done. I arrived at around 7am, 1  car in parking lot. The Windy Point trail is in great condition, lots of little steep switchbacks for about 1.25 miles. No nettles (I wore shorts) and very few bugs. No one on trial going up or coming down. From the Windy Point pictures, you can see lots of smoky haze from the forest fires happening around the state. The Iron Goat Trail, very easy to do and wide, with few bugs. Next time up there will do the upper loop to Windy Point crossover, Wellington then down to Martin Creek and back to Interpretive center. Took about 3 hours to do Windy Point and Iron Goat Trial. 	Aug 10, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-10.9868886992
North Creek Park Boardwalk	Muledeer	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Urban hike for hikeathon. Not much to report.  I had some time constraints so  we didn't quite make it to the Boardwalk from McCullum Park. Very popular paved trail thru Mill Creek from the McCullum P & R. It does have some nice woods, interpretive signs and little areas of wetland. Beware of bikers! We about got run over.

Granite Mountain	Sally H	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were terrible	Snow free	Decided to hike Granite after stopping by the Mt Washington lot and not seeing any other cars there - I try to pick busy hikes when hiking alone. I got started later than I prefer and definitely recommend an early start for this one. The first half of the hike is in the woods and the second half is nearly all direct sun on open slopes. The great news is that right now the slopes are covered in delicious huckleberries. Bring plenty of water and plan for a full half day hike. I prefer this hike to Si and Mailbox and would place it’s rigor somewhere between the two. Closest maybe to the Old Si Trail, but longer.  The smoke and heat made the breathing and pace more difficult than on a typical day. Still would rank this one of my favorites. The lookout is either locked from below or staffed. I just missed getting to go inside, running into the worker on his way down. The views were still worth the effort.

Edgar Rock	wishfulwanderer	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Got out for another hike-a-thon hike. I picked this hike since it was close-ish to Yakima and it could be easily combined with a visit to Boulder Cave. It was an interesting hike and probably would have been nicer if it wasn't smoky. The trailhead is pretty easy to find, especially if you're using Google maps (the trail is outlined on the map). There is limited parking but I was the only one there so I just pulled my car up into the trail. Once you're on the trail, there are some side trails at the beginning - stay to the right. There are even more side trails as you get near the rock. These would be interesting to explore some of these another time. Near the top, the trail splits and there is a sign indicating the trail and some kind hiker put an arrow on the sign indicating the way to Edgar Rock. Also near the top, the trail gets very dusty but overall the trail is great. There were several bees buzzing around the top so we didn't stay up there long. Also the views weren't great due to the smoke. While this wasn't my favorite hike, I think it would be a good one to do again, perhaps in the fall when it's not so hot and the smoke is gone.

Mount Washington	stmvi	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Who knew almost total solitude could be found so close to the city? Started up the trail at about 2:00 and saw only 4 people in the 4 hours I spent on Mt WA, two near the beginning and two going up as I came down. I agree with an earlier reporter the directions are funky, if not incorrect. Follow the trail from the south end of the parking lot as the site describes, turn left onto the road that you'll come to quickly. Pretty immediately you'll join the John Wayne trail where you'll veer right. From there take what I thought was the first trail leading into the woods to your left. I took the second trail as the site says, and found the trail, but coming down I learned the actual Mt WA trail is the first one. The trail is pretty straightforward, although rocky much of the way. The real joy of the trail were the handfuls of berries (salmons, black raspberries, huckleberries, thimbles), the solitude, and the shade since the trail is on the northeast side of the mountain. The smoke obscured the view from the top, which isn't superb at any rate, but I had it entirely to myself. Ran into two bears on my way down (the berries had made me wonder when I'd see them), a mother and cub.  This hike reminds me of McClellan, shady exercise. It lacks the drama of some of the other close hikes, but it's not without lovely rewards. But, the solitude was priceless. I'll try it again and hope others do, too.

Park Butte	moorecaitlin	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Boogied out of Seattle around 5am for a short weekend adventure and Park Butte Lookout hit all the marks. I was the second party to get to the lookout around 10am, and the nice family that got there an hour ahead of me let me stay out on the deck. It wasn't too cold and it was really something else to fall asleep below a sky full of stars and wake up right next to Mt. Baker in all her mountianous glory. The road in is pretty pot-holey with some dicey spots here and there, but nothing that should deter you. The trail itself is in great condition with wildflowers blooming, and who doesn't love a good flower in their life? I like that this trail has a great balance of forest, meadows, mountain views, lakes, and rivers - a little sprinkle of everything really. The trail starts out sweet and subtle and is fairly easy and gradual until you have about 1.5 miles to go. At this point the uphill battle to the lookout begins - brace yourself, huffing and puffing is coming. Even if you don't get to stay in the beloved lookout, there are tons of places to set up camp, and the little tiny "lakes" (very generous term for them) on the way up are perfect hammock spots too. 10/10 recommend. 12/10 recommend bringing more water than you think. 	Aug 10, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-12.1095320357
Fort Steilacoom Park	TiffanyBerry	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	We had planned a different hike, but ended up here. The path around the lake is paved, and very stroller friendly.  Some blackberries along the way made it even more fun.  Many of the criss-crossing intersecting trails are in open grassy area (so, at the moment, very dry), and we opted not to do them in the sun. Nice place to stop for a stroll if you end up in the area.	Aug 10, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-11.8557499222
Poo Poo Point - Chirico Trail	Jennie	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	It was a hot and smokey day, so nice to be in the shade and the cover of forest instead of thinking about the haze! The haze did obscure the view of Mt Rainier from the South viewpoint, but there was still a good view of Issaquah, Lake Sammamish and Bellevue from the summit. My GPS clocked it at 5.6 miles (not 3.8).  Great day!	Aug 10, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-11.4493889878
Mount Ellinor	D&D	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	There are plenty of trip reports, so won't be redundant about basics. We hiked the upper trail only. Smoke from the Maple fire almost made us rethink this hike, but I read it was supposed to improve. The trail was quite dry and smoky! As we ascended it improved and at the top you could see the smoke billowing in below. Anyway, this is a fairly difficult hike. My friend and I are in our 60s, experienced hikers, and this was quite a challenge. Bring poles for balancing over the rocks, skree and boulders. Some sections are quite steep, and for the most part the climb is relentless.  Here's a picture of my least favorite part: must be 500 stairs! Despite the difficulty and the haze which obscured the views, it's a wonderful hike and then there's the thrill of getting to the top for the 360 degree view! Not much space up there, and it's a popular hike so can be crowded.  It took way longer for us old folks to get to the top: about 2.5 hrs--1 hr longer than I expected, because we were so slow! Coming down was tricky 'cause it's so steep, and also took longer than I expected. But, still, kind of fun. You younger folks will take much less time to do this hike! I felt sorry for the dogs i saw with other hikers--people please don't subject your pups to this rough, gravelly, sharp rocky climb. Their poor feet! If you do, at least bring plenty of water and food for them and a doggie first aid kit.	Aug 10, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-11.5197170738
McClellan Butte	NellaS	Obstacles on trail:	    Trees down across trail.	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	I arrived to the trailhead at 6:20am and was the only one there. I got to enjoy the trail alone all the way up and even had the top all for myself too for a while. The trail’s in good condition. Only a few fallen trees across the trail. The scramble at the top was a little too much for me, since I’m terrified of climbing and I was alone. So I only went halfway up and enjoyed the view from there. Saw a few people coming up when I started heading down, but I was really surprised something this beautiful along I-90 can be so quiet!

Old Sauk Mountain Trail	C P	Trail difficult/impossible to navigate:	    .	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Went up Sauk Mountain Trail to check out the part of the Old Sauk Mt. Trail I hadn't seen.  Begins down as the trail to Sauk Lake from near the top of the ridge, the Lake can't be seen from the start (5300'). Switchbacks down through flowers to where the Lake trail goes left, straight down is the Old Sauk Mountain Trail toward the Hegg Benson (4850').  Old trail stays on the nose of the ridge, nice valley views, many flowers still in bloom, tons of butterflies and bees. About 100' above where meadows end in trees the faint trail vanishes (4600').  Here I headed straight down to where I thought a trail might go.  Off in places, right on in others, followed faint tread to 4300' where I ran out of flags (only had my emergency stash with me). I have to look back at my reports to see how high I have been from the bottom, pretty sure higher than the 3300' I clipped up to a few months ago- could be as little as a few hundred feet I have yet to locate.  If someone doesn't beat me to it I will find the rest in the next couple weeks, then clean it up.  Easier to do the last part from the top than the bottom, loop would be good the same way. So if you see someone walking up the road offer them a ride, they may drive you back to the top if you do it with them, not just yet though.  Go check it out!

Strawberry Mountain	Wander_the_pnw	Obstacles on trail:	    .	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Some confusion with this one. I followed the directions WTA outlines for this hike and reached Strawberry Mtn after about 2.5 miles. I'm not sure where this being listed as over 10 miles comes from exactly. I did go past the identified split at the mountain for a mile or so but really encountered nothing of note and wouldn't really encourage others to.  The 2.5 miles was mostly always heading up but I don't have an elevation count. There are tons of wildflowers and LOTS of ripe berries for the taking currently. The view would be awesome but the haze really made it limited today. Very interesting to see the entire blast zone laid out in front of you like that. I'd recommend poles for actually going up and down the actual peak as it's pretty steep and very lose soil.  The trail is obviously not used much but it's not bad honestly and never was it difficult to clearly see. It's a nice option if you're looking for a quick and moderate hike to an interesting view filled with berries and flowers.  There is some debate about going another way so refer to older reports for that but it seems to me after doing some reading that it is in fact another destination and not actual Strawberry Mtn.  Happy trails.	Aug 10, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-10.7327367156
Church Creek	amdame1	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	It was smoky from the wildfires, but we did not see   else on the trail and there was no trash at all on the trail (which sad to say, I always see when I hike in the Cascade regions), so it was lovely. Plus there were ripe huckleberries and thimbleberries! We had meant to hike Pine Lake, but missed it somehow so we did this one instead. It was a bit more elevation gain than we had planned on, so we did not do the descent all the way down to Satsop Lake as it was so hot and we would have had to do that climb back out again. But the old growth forest is lovely, the fireweed was blooming.  If you are looking for beauty and isolation, this is the place. #HikingtheState	Aug 09, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-14.9534119079
Aasgard Pass	AshleyHikes	Minor obstacles posing few problems	Road rough but passable	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	We camped at Lake Stuart and on Friday, August 10, day hiked from there to Colchuck Lake and up Aasgard Pass to Inspiration Lake, which was about a 15-ish mile day and a lot of elevation gain and loss. Conditions were mostly clear, with a slight smoky haze hanging around.  We didn't have too much of a problem finding the trail up Aasgard Pass, which was long and steep and yes, long, but doable. However, coming back down the pass was much more difficult and it was easier to lose the trail, which felt much less stable than on the way up. Crossing the boulder/talus field in between the base of Aasgard Pass and Colchuck was also trickier on the way back toward the trailhead. **  (just off the trail, near a spot in the giant boulders where you can get into the lake). They are teal and dark gray women's Black Diamond poles and, as a gift, mean a lot to me. Reward! If you find them, please let me know here: https://ashleybraun.com/contact-me/ ** Also, warning that the Green Trails map and a sign indicate that there is a toilet at the campsites near Inspiration Lake in the core at the top of Aasgard, but we couldn't find it. Bring a trowel. Bugs were somewhat bothersome but mostly swattable in heavily vegetated areas at dawn and dusk. A lovely but intense way to see the core of the Enchantments.

The Enchantments	TerrySanders0103	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Intermittent snow - not hard to cross	A group of 3 of us embarked on a Thru-hike of the Enchantments, beginning from the Colchuck side. We stayed in Leavenworth the night before so as to get an early start the next day. We left one vehicle at Snow Lakes Trailhead for the next day.We hit the trail at 5:50am and quickly moved through the quiet forest and arrived at Colchuck Lake at 8:00 am. We had a quick snack then began working our way around the lake to the bottom of Asgard Pass. As far as following the route, there is some signage but you mostly have to follow the Cairns to know where you are going. We started working our way up the large boulders of Asgard at roughly 8:30 and began seeing several Goats, a few with their young. They were curious but not an issue. We continued up, taking only a couple of short water breaks, and finally reached the top of Asgard at 11:30. You definitely want to allow at least 2 1/2-3 hours for getting up the pass. We were all in good climbing shape and it just takes a long time. Definitely try and get up it early in the day before the sun gets hot and to allow for time in the Core. We then hiked into the core zone and were greeted with the most spectacular scenery: beautiful alpine lakes, snow fields lining the lakes, and endless beauty all around. We had lunch at one of the first lakes, and took a nice refreshing swim to cool off. We only lingered a total of an hour, and then pushed on. The Enchantments themselves were awesome and very enjoyable. There are plenty of streams to fill your water along the way, but limited options once you begin your descent so be sure to fill up before leaving.  This is when things got pretty tough. We hiked down towards the Snow Lakes Trail crossing switchbacks through large rock fields and granite rock faces for hours and hours, taking a toll on our knees and ankles. It is a tremendous push just to get down to Snow Lakes, then you still have 6-7 miles still to go. We met a mother and son along the way down who were not prepared, wearing tennis shoes with no daypacks and without a water filter. We ended up finishing the last mile in the dark (luckily we brought headlamps). However, the trail is listed at 18 miles..THIS IS NOT ACCURATE. Each of us using our Garmins clocked in between 22-23 miles and did not veer off the trail. It took us 15 hours to complete so please if you are going to thru-hike make sure to allow plenty of time. It’s a beast but definitely worth it :) Hope this helps. Enjoy	Aug 09, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-13.4867722904
Thunder Creek	Freckledsunshine	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	hiked 3 miles of this trail with toddlers. little legs kept asking how to access the river as we followed it, so big teaser trail for kids. very well shaded trail and we did find a spot to reach the water safely. lots of giant beetles and rocks for kids to trip on. they loved bouncing on the bridge. the first stretch is not difficult and good for young children and just turn around when ready. afterwards we went across the highway to play in the lake and cool off We hiked this as part of hike a thon. Please feel free to support us as we get out there hiking with toddlers and raising money for hike a thon  Give.wta.org/Maggielou 	Aug 09, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-10.4777271733
Mount Pilchuck	misslanna	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	We got to the trail around 11:30am and there were atleast 20 cars there and lots of room for more. The road leading up to the trail had so many potholes but it was manageable.  Right as we started the hike, the flies and other bugs flooded our way; the nice girls coming back offered us their bug spray. Once we got to the rocky part of the trail, the bugs weren’t bad at all.  The trail itself is mostly rocks. I am so so glad i wore shoes with a harder sole because the bottoms of my feet would of been dead.  The hike itself wasn’t too difficult but take your time. The hardest part was the end; we couldn’t wait to be at the top. While we saw many cars in the lot, there weren’t too many people out.  I strongly recommend wearing shoes with a stable sole, bring lots of water, and grab some fruit for replenishment once at the top! Amazing view!

Granite Mountain	Goupthemtn	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	Got an early start on the trail by 7:00 a.m., but it was already warm. There were about five cars in the lot. (So nice to hike during the week without the crowds!) The hike starts moderately and in and out of forest cover until the sharp right turn onto the Granite Mtn specific trail. Then things get interesting (as in steep) as the trail climbs through forest and periodic exposed avalanche areas. Smoke and haze kept the views away and we never saw Mt. Rainier. Bugs got really annoying once the trail breaks out into alpine meadows and pestered us during the break at the summit. Views were better up here and even with the haze made the trip worth it! The lookout is closed for reconstruction due to jerks vandalizing the cabin. Great workout and the heat made us take our time. Up and down in 4-1/2 hours, with a 45 minute break at the top.

Naches Peak Loop	MattMan81	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Wildfire smoke is blanketing the area, so it was difficult to see Mount Rainier; however, that wouldn’t stop my daughter and I from capturing some wonderful views of paintbrushes, lupines, and pasqueflowers. With the wildfire smoke all around, I didn’t think that going clockwise for the views made much sense, so we went counterclockwise from the upper parking area at Tipsoo Lake. The trail was very well-maintained and gradual making it the perfect Daddy-Daughter hike. Any short hike is perfect when you’re carrying an extra 45lbs on your back. Ha We passed up lots of families with kids and a few PCT hikers heading their way up to Snoqualmie Pass from Cascade Locks. Despite the smoke, the fields were full of beautiful, colorful flowers (lupines, paintbrushes, and pasqueflowers). Dewey Lake was visible along with Seymour Peak. There were many hikers following the clockwise recommendation and there were some pretty cool people up on the trails today. The bugs weren’t too bad, but the haze made the sun a little harsh. Make sure to pack some sunscreen especially if you have little ones. Water is definitely necessary as well. Tipsoo Lake was filled with tadpoles, so the kids may like that. We started around 1:30pm and finished up around 3:15pm.   It feels good getting another hike done with my daughter. Growing up hiking with my Dad was one of my favorite childhood memories. I just hope that she can have similar memories to reminisce about when she gets older. Happy Trails, everyone!

Old Sauk River Trail	Muledeer	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	A perfect hike for a hot day! There was no one at the TH when we arrived around 9. The trail is in good condition and has some nice new signage and there is a new kiosk since I hiked here last. We hiked down the ADA trail to the river trail and headed left toward the north TH. There is no easy river access, there is a steep dropoff, you have to find your way around some standing water, then over a water bar with alder before you reach the river. The forest is beautiful, with lots of maples filtering the sunlight, hanging moss on the limbs and a soft path lined with large trees. The trail ends at the north parking lot, head back the way you came. For better river access, take the Murphy trail at the intersection, along that section is better access to the river with some nice sandy spots and good lunch rocks. We followed the Murphy trail to it's end at Murphy Creek, where we sat down and had our lunch. If you want to do some quiet contemplation in the woods, this is your trail.  Hikeathon:  give.wta.org/Muledeer 	Aug 09, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-09.6093366249
Sunrise to Carbon River Traverse	MegLvs2Hike	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	I hiked from Sunrise to Carbon River as part of a two day one night backpacking trip all the way to Mowich Lake via Spray Park. I camped at Cataract Valley just past Carbon River so this report covers the first day and I have a separate report for the second day/Spray Park Trail. The first day from Sunrise to my camp was a doozy of a 16 mile day. I started later than I wanted at 930 which made me a little worried as the Ranger when I picked up my permit the day before warned me about the dangerous crossing at Winthrop Creek and recommend doing it early in the day. The day I hiked was hot and smoky/hazy so the views weren’t as clear as they could have been but still impressive. The hike from Sunrise to Skyscraper is great views both towards the mountain and out, and today also had Marmots and Mountain Goats for even more entertainment. I was happy to find all the remaining snow had melted from the trail since I was last there a few weeks before. The hike down past Granite Creek to Winthrop was foresty and shady and I didn’t realize how nice it was until I was out hot and exposed on the climb to Mystic. As I approached Winthrop I could hear chunks of rock roll off of the melting glacier less than half a mile above the crossing and I nervously pushed quickly to get down to the creek. Happily when I got there I found they had added a handrail to the log bridge, none of which was underwater as had been previously reported, even though it was 1230 on a 90 degree day. I hope their bridge fix holds up as it made for an easy crossing over an intimidating glacial flow. The next part was mostly baking in the sun as I climbed toward Mystic Lake. I happily doused myself in the next water crossing which I think was West Fork of the White River although much tamer than the “creek” I just crossed before. After finally making it to Mystic I happily took a rest and snack break by the shore before pushing on. Only a little more climbing led me up to a pass above Moraine Park with a nice view of Rainier. Moraine Park ended up being one of my favorite parts of the day with butterflies dancing everywhere and the North Side of Rainier dominating the background. As I crossed the park I heard a big cracking sound coming from the mountain and realized a huge piece of ice must have fallen off as a large cloud of snow began to be visible trailing down the face. It was such a neat place, wish I could have stayed longer but I wanted to get to camp. Got into some more shade as I made my way down past Dick Creek toward Carbon. It was really fun hiking along Carbon Glacier and seeing the river starting flowing right out from underneath the end of it. I crossed the suspension bridge and wished I was camping at Carbon River rather than another 1.6 miles and over 1000 more feet up at Cataract. The trail up was in forest and shaded with thickets full of ripe berries. The berries were pretty and tasty but probably the cause of the report of a bear on the trail from hikers coming down. I put on some music and sang along the best I could as I huffed and puffed my way up that last sweaty mile and didn’t see a bear. When I finally got to camp I found a nice camp spot by a gurgling creek and happily dropped my pack. My day had been wonderful on the aptly named trail but exhausting, took a little hydration, food and rest before I was ready to set up camp. Everyone should do that section if they get the chance, I would definitely do it again, but either more leisurely, stopping at Mystic or Dick Creek, or lighter and faster as an epic all day trail run. Anyone interested?	Aug 09, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-11.0817079268
Independence and North Lakes	LJRandall	Trail in good condition	Road recommended for high clearance only	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	Independence lake was the perfect place to overnight after a hot hike in. My girls immediately jumped right into the lake as I set up camp! The road was typical logging road rough. The rock slide was still there but no big rocks. And to be safe I would only drive high clearance vehicles up there. The trail is also very interesting. I liked it! And I went slower than usual with all the roots and rocks. (I’ve been backpacking with a sprained ankle which slows me down). The kiddos I brought struggled a bit with the incline but they did it! I took a separate hike myself up to North Lake Pass. Totally worth the uphill climb. Beautiful! And the berries are just getting good. I got to the point where you can continue to North Lake or head to Helena Ridge (which I cannot find on my maps but looks interesting). The bugs were annoying and I used spray. The constant hum of the bugs kinda bugged 😉 me a bit but that’s part of backpacking or hiking to these amazing locations. The top two inches of the lake were a nice temp. I got in and got out but the girls swam for a long while.	Aug 09, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-11.9034948828

The weather was beautiful, slight haze due to wildfires. It has been more than 10 years since I have been up to the visitor center. I forgot how breath taking it is.

West Tiger 3	Suhleenah	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Parked at Tradition Plateau/High Point around 4:45pm and hike/ran up the Nook trail to the unmaintained Section Line, up the Section to West Tiger 3 and down the West Tiger 3 trail. This loop is about 4.5 miles and just under 2000 gain. Nice and steep up the Section, the upper part is steeper than the Cable Line!  Collected lots of cobwebs on the Section Line, haha. No water running in any of the streams so bring your own! Quite a bit of company on their after-work training hikes up the WT3 trail but looks like everyone had their own bit of solitude.  It was 90 at the trailhead when I parked, but shady along the way and a bit cooler at the summit. Perfect weather for dressing lightly! Didn't have any bug issues so the shorts and sports bra worked perfect! 	Aug 09, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-10.1787186983
Melakwa Lake	Kronst	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	:  4.5 of 5 stars!   :  This is a nice hike.  The waterfalls are beautiful and the hike is a moderate hike.  It has some nice mountain views on the way up.  The lake is pretty and fun to explore.  Definitely walk left around the lake to see the Upper Melakwa Lake & continue around the main lake.  (I don’t think you can walk around the lake due to the cliffs.)  There are plenty of places to take a dip.   : For all cars.  We got there at about 2:30 pm on a Friday and we found some parking spaces because others left.   :  None.   :  None.   :  Great.     When you get to the waterfall area with all the kids swimming, the main trail to Melakwa Lake is to the left.  My hiking partner saw the sign marked “Main Trail.” I would have walked along the rocks and missed this.    There are many families up to the waterfall.  We saw only about 3 hikers after the waterfalls.   :  Not bad!  I think I had one bite, but I used Neem bug spray.   : This trail took us (60 & 47 year old guys) about 7 hours-3 hours up, 1/2 hour exploring the lake, and 2.5 hours down.   :  Very nice mountain and waterfall views!      :  Minimal.

Beckler Peak	huffnpuff	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	We arrived at the trailhead a little after noon. Two cars in the parking lot. Met one party of two people coming down as we were headed up. It was fun to see some different wildflowers than I've seen lately on other trails. Various sorts of berries - thimbleberries, trailing blackberries, blueberries/blue huckleberries.The first mile had been sprayed with an herbicide yesterday to tackle invasive species, but it wasn't marked where it ended, so considered the thimbleberries and ripening trailing blackberries off limits as probably in the stretch.  Even though this trail is in shade a lot, it was still hot today. And the bugs were probably beyond annoying. Anytime we stopped, they were bothering and biting us...and even when moving, we got bit. The only time we seemed to be free or mostly free of them was a spot near the top where there was a bit of a breeze and at the top. It was quite hazy/smoky today so the views in the photos of the last few days were not to be. We could see lots of mountains, but not real well.  A cooler day, with less bugs and less haze, the views at the top must be really enjoyable.

Barclay Lake	hayleefaye	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Headed to Barclay for lunch and a swim. Got to the trailhead at 11 and the parking lot was mostly full. It was just starting to get hot but the trail is pretty shaded and cool. There are some large flys and bees buzzing around but if you keep moving, they won't bother you. The trail is pretty straightforward and took me about 40 minutes to reach the lake. There is very little/no running water on the trail anymore - a dry creek bed now runs beside the trail. There are lots of little beaches for hikers to spread out on. My group had lunch and floated in the lake on blow-up floaties, which was very fun. The water is pretty cold even with the heat so it was nice to have something to sit on. While we were at the lake, wingsuiters jumped off of a sub-peak of Mt. Baring which was definitely a sight to see. There was a loud buzzing overhead and then a person was falling out of the sky until they opened their parachute. Very cool!  Stayed at the lake until about 2 and then headed back.  Would recommend this hike for people with younger kids or who just want to quickly get to an alpine lake. Definitely not the most beautiful but very easily accessible. #watrailsday	Aug 09, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-09.3151448520
Surprise and Glacier Lakes	abkoch	Minor obstacles posing few problems	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	I spent most of the day working as part of the WTA work party on the trail. We brushed and worked on various drainages up to the log crossing of the creek (roughly 1.3 miles into the hike). After the work day was over, I headed up to see the lakes as this was a new trail for me. The overgrowth farther up the trail is significantly worse than parts we worked on. Especially in the avalanche fields, the growth really encroaches on the trail. Hopefully tomorrow's work party can do some damage, but it is unlikely that they will be able to make it up to where the densest overgrowth encroachment is occurring. That being said, the salmonberries are plentiful and delicious right now, with lots of opportune snacking possibilities along the trail. A few wildflowers left, but clearly on the tail end of their season. The bugs were not horrible, but plenty of flies buzzing and especially at the lake they circled consistently. Got in a nice, refreshing swim at Surprise lake, which was greatly appreciated after a day's work, before swinging by Glacier lake quickly and hustling back down. 	Aug 09, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-09.5271455322
Mount St. Helens - Monitor Ridge	mkroeger	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Decided to summit this mountain with my bestfriend today. I'd say we're decently versed hikers.  We started at 0430 and reached the summit at 1030. Those 6 hours were grueling, especially the last mile and a half of the trail. We took LOTS of breaks throughout the day. Spent an hour and a half at the summit. No, views unfortunately. It's super HAZY, due to the WA, OR, and CA fires. Which was super disappointing. We packed 5 liters of water each and ran out before the last two miles on the way DOWN.  Gloves were super helpful as well as trekking poles. And be sure to have your permit! A ranger had climbed up and checked everyone he encountered.	Aug 09, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-09.5775116506
Lake Valhalla	Picketwire	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	My dog and I left for the Smithbrook trailhead last night, hoping to leave smoke and heat behind. We were on the trail by 6:30 am and while it wasn't hot, it wasn't cool that early in the morning either. And sadly, smoke was pretty bad there, too. On the up side, I had the trail all to myself until I got to the lake. (I went up part way to McCausland, but decided to stop half way up.) There were 5 people at or near the lake and then quite a few coming up as I made my way back to the trailhead, but I have to say that I've never run in to any rude people any where that I've hiked. Most are friendly and polite and at worst just aloof, but that's ok, too. (Although, a couple times I've passed people who were playing their music on their bluetooth speakers, but I don't think of that as rude, just thoughtless.) There were mosquitoes in the parking lot, but I'd treated my clothes with permethrin and sprayed myself with deet, so I wasn't bothered by them at all. I'm not a big fan of chemicals, but I'm less of a fan of biting bugs. This is an easy hike. Easier than Snow Lake. Similar to Twin Sisters Lakes, just a little longer.

Tonga Ridge / Mount Sawyer	ugie52	Minor obstacles posing few problems	Road rough but passable	Bugs were terrible	Snow free	I only hiked up to Sawyer today but there are a couple of things to report. Regarding the road to the trailhead, there are some potholes and washboard spots but if you check your speed you will see them coming and they can be avoided.  The trail is neither good or bad, really.  It is rocky with lots of roots to navigate, but those also help you uphill.  The main problem with the trail was there is foliage growing in from the sides and sometimes you cannot avoid brushing against it.  Not too bad on the Tonga Trail but on the Mountain trail, sometimes you can't see the trail.  I think these bugs love Deet.  No matter how much I put on, they still landed on me.  No bites, but an annoyance. The views from the top of Sawyer are slightly obscured due to smoke from fires.  It didn't really bother my throat or eyes but you could smell it from the top of the mountain.  The views are still there, just hazy.

Naches Peak Loop	Bob and Barb	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	After setting up camp at Silver Springs CG, we hiked this loop clockwise. We parked along HWY 410 above Tipsoo Lake and hiked around the east side of  Tipsoo Lake to the trail which takes you from the picnic area parking lot to Chinook Pass and the PCT. Except for false hellebore, Pasqueflower seedhead and Cascade asters the flowers are mostly past their prime. Magenta paintbrush, rosy spirea, arrowleaf groundsel, buckwheat, and harebells were some of the other flowers seen. There were about 10 shaggy mane fungi near the second tarn. Bob was bothered by mosquitoes, but I fortunately had no problem. (Maybe they didn't like my sunscreen! :)!) Lighting for photos of Mt Rainier seen above the tarn on the NP section of the trail is best in the AM and early afternoon, but today the mountain was hidden behind a smokey haze so it didn't matter that we were there in the late afternoon. 	Aug 09, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-14.0508904868
Pine Lake	amdame1	Minor obstacles posing few problems	Road rough but passable	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	The biggest obstacle is actually finding the trail head! SR 200 is not signed at all, so make sure you pay attention to your odometer. It's 1.2 miles from where you split from route 23. Where the road ends, it just looks like a camp site. Good luck. #HikingtheState	Aug 09, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-14.6302658290
Greenwater and Echo Lakes	SMCS	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	We met a couple at the trailhead whose truck had been broken into overnight and made a point not leave valuables (or anything that thieves might mistake as valuable) in the car. We hiked with our inexperienced 8yr old and 11yr old and they loved Greenwater Lake (destination for the first night).  Bugs were not bad here and the water was beautiful. We headed to Echo Lake for the second night and it was a real push for our 8yr old.  Mosquitos came out around the area of the bog (though there was no evidence of any water present).  By the time we made it to Echo Lake, bug situation had improved, though the lake water was rough on our water filter.  We didn't realize how much Echo Lake was effected by wildfires from last year and were in awe of the reach of the burn.  We were there early on Friday and got the big spot with direct lake access.  On the way back on Sat afternoon we had to do some extra scouting to find a spot along the river as the ones we had in mind were full already. We were still able to find a nice spot, though it was a bit out of the way. Trail condition was fine for our group though we did need to be careful of footing at a few points along the way. Word to the wise: the toilet at the Norse Peak Wilderness Area sign is worth the stop if you've got to go.  ;)	Aug 09, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-13.0245129790
Lake Stuart	NQG Hikers	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were terrible	Snow free	Our destination today was Stuart Lake.  We got to the TH at 9 and many parking spots were still available.  The trail is in great shape and very dry.  There was no water to cross anywhere along the way.  Because it was hot (90s) and hazy due to recent fires, this hike was more challenging then it would have been in better weather and air quality conditions.  We stopped to rest and catch our breath many times on the way to the lake.  The mountain views as you approach the meadows are awesome!!  The wildflowers in the meadows were in full bloom and beautiful.  The lake is serene and nestled in a stunning mountain setting.   The bugs were very bad throughout this hike, so we couldn't stop long anywhere without being swarmed.  We applied and reapplied our bug spray several times.  Bug spray and hiking poles were a must for us on this hike.

Ladder Creek Falls	Freckledsunshine	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	enjoyed the light show with a bunch of toddlers. we went right at dusk so did not need flashlights. lights had just turned on. we stayed long enough until it was pitch dark and saw how bright the lights were. grabbed the glowsticks... next time bring a light sweater it is chilly by the falls. kids enjoyed the suspension bridge. trail is definitly suitable for little legs even with all the stairs.  we did this hike as part of our hike a thon hike please feel free to support our team as we continue hiking with toddlers  give.wta.org/Maggielou	Aug 09, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-10.9906374614
Marmot Pass - Upper Big Quilcene	slowdonald	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	The drive up FS Road 2750 wasn't bad. Portions are paved, but there are LARGE potholes on the unpaved portion on the last 4 miles or so. If you are driving a low clearance vehicle, drive slow.  I arrived at the trailhead at 1030 on a Thursday. There were a few cars parked but plenty of space. The hike starts out easy enough but be prepared for the elevation gain. After you pass the first camp site you start moving towards more exposed parts of the trail, eventually crossing two rock fields. If you feel like the trail is gone, it's not, just keep going.  Once you reach Camp Mystery go straight through. You'll enter a meadow where you have two more uphills to get that last 400 feet or so of elevation until you reach the pass. The views were a little hazy but well worth it at the top. 	Aug 09, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-10.0748015409
Lena Lake	Jimpaxinos	Trail in good condition	Road impassable/closed	No bugs	Snow free	Road and trailhead for Lower/Upper Lena Lake is CLOSED due to forest fire.

Spring Lake/Lake Desire Park	EmilB	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	We arrived about 10 AM on a sunny Thursday to find only one other car in the modest parking lot at the end of W Spring Lake Drive SE.   There were no paper maps at the trailhead.  See the additional links for King County's current map.  However, the map is not complete; in our short walk we saw three trails (definitely maintained trails - one with a bridge - not informal foot paths) that were not on the map.  The map also lacks the trail names that are posted on trail intersection signs.  So, every now and then you have to stop and think about where you are. There are three reasons to visit this park: (1) you are a local, (2) you are walking your dog somewhere new, or (3) you are a King County park completionist.  If the above don't describe you, there is no draw here that justifies the drive to Maple Valley. Trail types are diverse (gravel road, flat gravel trail, narrow foot trails threading through the forest) with a lot of up and down.  Bicycles and horses are allowed on the trails, but we saw none; we only saw one other person.  The water access point to Lake Desire is dog-friendly, but the area was littered with cigarette butts and a tangle of fishing line (which I removed).  The trails surrounding Lake Desire also had a sprinkling of beer bottle caps.  So, some of King County's less savory elements do make appearances here. It looks like the locals bring their dogs to the public Spring Lake boat launch for water access; and, it's a short walk from the trailhead.  If you bring a dog, stop by the launch before and after your walk for a dip. Per Garmin, 2.04 miles/259 vertical feet.	Aug 09, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-09.7286318618
Surprise and Glacier Lakes	HeatherJasper	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	The short section of dirt road leading to the tail head is easily passable to even low clearance vehicles like a Prius. The turn off from highway 2 is eight miles east of the Skykomish Ranger Station and directly across from the sign for the Iron Goat Interpretive Center for east bound traffic. The railroad crossing does not have any lights or gates for trains, so stop and listen carefully before driving across. I saw a WTA work party repairing drains and clearing brush from the first mile of the trail. Most of the trail is in great condition, although some areas are overgrown where the work parties have not yet reached. The recent work has made a lot of improvements. Thank you, volunteers! Most of the trail is very pleasant, with a little less than a mile that is steeper and has switchbacks when you get up close to the lake. When you are near the slopes with rockfall, listen for marmots and pikas. I saw both on the trail near Surprise Lake. Once you arrive at the lake, there are clear signs for the connection to the PCT and Glacier Lake. Two toilets are clearly signed as well. The lake is the perfect temperature for swimming in August and a great reward after a hot hike. There are numerous small streams that cross the trail on the way up, but few access points to Surprise Creek from the trail. Flies were a nuisance but I only saw one mosquito all day. 	Aug 09, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-11.2426182741
Big Cedar Tree - Kalaloch	MaryJ	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Short drive in from Hwy 101 on a gravel road. The tree is just slightly in the woods from the parking. Great to see!! Some people were walking into the woods further. The tree is broken down somewhat but still cool to see!! There was a guy sitting on the sidewalk playing his guitar for money. Lol. Worth the short stop to see the tree!

Bench and Snow Lakes	Jennekehikes	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	We reached the trailhead at 5:30 to find two cars, one empty (we assume belonging to overnighters camping at Snow Lake) and the other with people sleeping inside and outside on the concrete. We quietly gathered our gear as not to disturb and headed onto the trail.  The trail is lovely, and in good shape. As other trip reports mention there is a lot of up and down over hills between flat wanders along beautiful meadows. There is a post, but no sign, and the trail to Bench lake. The way is steep but brief, and requires a bit of a scramble for anyone with short legs - but it is well worth it to catch the view of Rainier over the lake. Bench lake is a great spot to take in the view and dip your toes in the water with a fair amount of beach and logs available right now for sitting and relaxing. We followed the trail past Snow Lake along Unicorn Creek to the end of the maintained trail and just a little bit past before returning the way we came as the sun came up over the trees. Only met a pair of outbound overnighters and one other hiker on trail this morning.	Aug 09, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-10.1955461815
Annette Lake	Cowpie	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Great day for a swim in Annette Lake.  We left Seattle at 9 am and arrived at the trailhead parking lot at 10:30 am.  Yup.....morning traffic....yuck.  The parking lot had around 20 vehicles. My hiking partner was in 4th gear.  She was really moving fast...I was winded keeping up.  Granted I was carrying 10 lbs of ice surrounding ice cream.  Well worth it.  😀 We packed in snorkeling equipment along with a wetsuit.  She had a great time checking out the lake bottom.  The water was refreshing.  We watched two women swim back and forth across the lake....both good swimmers. The lake was not crowded.....and we easily found a nice lake front spot to hang out.  Great hike.	Aug 09, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-10.0123678944
Gothic Basin	hburkhart11	Obstacles on trail:	    Trees down across trail.	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	What a hike! The way up was way more strenuous than I was anticipating, but the destination you reach is worth it! The hike in is basically all uphill, make sure you have plenty of water with you! We arrived at the trailhead around 8:30, and it took us about 3 hours to reach Gothic Basin. You will cross a few streams where you can refill your water if you have a filter or something like it. You’ll know when you’ve reached your destination, it is one of the most beautiful places I have ever been. We took a dip in one of the lakes and spent about 2 hours exploring the basin. The description is right, you will wish you had brought your gear with you to stay the night. When we decided it was time to head back home, it was SO hot, we felt bad for all the people we passed coming up on our way down. The way down is all downhill, and hard on the knees, so bring your poles if you have them! 	Aug 09, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-10.5823712077
Snow Lake	SeaRick1	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	I have a friend who has lived in Seattle all her life and had never visited Snow Lake so this was the day to do it. To avoid the crowds we decided to do an afternoon start with sunset views for out hike out. The road to Alpental is well maintained and the trailhead has ample parking with restrooms. It was very warm making our way up the rocky trail, soon we were wet with sweat and reapplying sunblock for the final mile of mostly into the sun switchbacks. Not being as avid a hiker as I am my friend started to question her decision to join being a tad hot and uncomfortable. Her attitude changed when she got her first view of the lake as we crested the overlook ridge. It was a fantastic afternoon of swimming, diving and floating on our packed in inflatables. Upon leaving we did clean up some trash others carelessly left by others. Remember folks, PACK IT IN PACK IT OUT! The hike out was breathtaking with a glowing orange sunset and pink clouds, the bugs did get thicker, luckily we were able to borrow repellent from some nearby campers. If you go later in the day it's a good idea to bring a headlamp or flashlight as the valley gets dark quickly.

Mount Pilchuck	'los	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	Oy vey, 5 a.m. was early to rise and grind for Mt Pilchuck with Boy Wonder. Through #sweatandsunscreen though, we did it. Let’s be honest, there’s no doubt that he could make it. It was the old, slow guy, that was questionable. 2️⃣ hours to trudge up there, 2️⃣ to clamor down because I was geocaching (wanted to find the 5 up there) Though, we totally mobbed down the mountain ⛰ from one cache to the next.  You’d think I’d pick an easier hike for my inaugural hike for the 2018 season but ... nope.

Lake Valhalla	Hamabear	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Wanted a nice easy hike to a lake purely for swimming purposes in the 90 degree weather, so we headed to Valhalla.  Got to the trailhead around 10:30, and it was pretty much full. Fits maybe 15 or so cars. Got to the lake around noon and spent an hour and a half there. The lake is the perfect temp for swimming! Then it got really hot so we headed back down and made it to the car by about 3:00.	Aug 09, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-09.3411966346
Bandera Mountain	ninjaracerchick	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Road is in great condition, only a few potholes to contend with. Trail goes up up up, with this heat be ready to sweat! Great views even with the wildfire haze, wildflowers are still blooming though the beargrass is done, and there are pleanty of wild blueberries that are ripe for the pickin! The bugs weren’t bad, but the further up we got the more present the biting flies and horseflies were. Great workout with the payoff to make it worth it!

Thunder Creek	ToddlerTrekking	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	This is a great trail for kiddos and hot days! We hiked just out to the big bridge and back for a round trip of three miles. When we hiked in May last year, there were lots of wildflowers and fungus growing. This time it was too hot and dry for either. Thankfully the trail is mostly shaded and in a couple sections you get a cool draft from the river. The bridge is is beautiful, just watch wild kiddos as the railings are spaced far enough that small ones could fall through. After the hike, there is a good spot to go splash in Diablo Lake next to the Thunder Knob parking area across the street from where you turned in for this trail.

Fisher Lake	seadude	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	What a great hike! Our first time visiting Fisher Lake. First time hiking Central Cascades. Bugs were fairly gnarly as soon as we stepped out of the car. Wasn't ready for them so that set the stage on edge a little. First 2/3 of the hike are fairly level. Couple of pretty vistas. Last 1/3 of the hike is where all of the elevation comes in. One scramble up a dried creek bed(?) that has some moisture (more bugs), fairly steep. Our 12 year olds had no real issue navigating. Once we got to the lake and settled in, we really absorbed the beauty of the place. Spent all our time swimming and fishing. No big fish (our lure selection was small), couple small trout. Cool frogs hopping around. Witnessed an osprey dive and catch a fish! The last 2/3 of the hike are almost entirely in Huckleberry(?) bushes. The lake is also surrounded by Hucks. They were not ripe yet (barely green) but I imagine this entire area will be attracting some large mammals soon :). Something to maybe consider. We made a rookie mistake and left a ziplock bag of trail mix under our tent entrance next to our shoes. Had a visitor that night which was a bit unnerving. Had to get up and duct tape the ziplock shut and put it in our backpack. The rest of the food we of course hung in our food bags ~100 yards from the camp site. Overall the place was great. I'd totally go back! Recommend you bring a mosquito net and wide brimmed hat, leggings and long sleeve shirt, bug spray to keep the bugs off of you. I had all these and still have a good 15-20 skeeter bites! But again, swimming in this pristine lake and watching the kids fish was very special.

Barclay Lake	abbyt	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	We arrived at the trailhead just before 10 am and nearly had the place to ourselves - just two cars in the parking lot. My friend and I were looking for a relatively quick and easy hike and this fit the bill perfectly. It took us 45 minutes at a fairly leisurely pace to reach the lake and the elevation gain was pretty minimal - just a few ups and downs here and there. We were so pleasantly surprised on reaching the lake - it’s got plenty of space to spread out and relax and we did just that! We had the beach to ourselves for about 45 minutes and we simply took in the stunning view. We encountered quite a few groups on our way out (14 cars in the lot when we left) so go early if you want the lake to yourself - it’s worth it!!

Wallace Falls - Lake Loop	parisrobin	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Started a leisurely hike at 11:30am and finished 7:00pm. Our route: Woody Trail to Upper Falls, followed grey diamonds on ~10 trees to get to upper boundary road, passed logging areas outside park for ~2 miles, came to T-intersection and turned Left, followed "New Rd" for ~1 mile, passed a kiosk for Wallace Lake (Right) and in 200yd entered the forest on the Greg Ball Trail (Left); enjoyed a lovely meditative river setting on a brand new bench, passed a roaring gorge, found a composting privy at end of Greg Ball Trail, walked down the road ~0.5 mi, got on the Woody Trail and hiked a couple more miles to the parking lot. Signage is very good. And you can customize your trip as you go. We planned on the full 9 mile loop, but found a couple ways to shorten it by 1.5 mile. We decided not to go all the way to the lake. Few hikers if any seemed to be hiking the loop or hiking to the lake.	Aug 09, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-10.4473588952

Palouse to Cascades Trail - The Tunnel	TiffanyBerry	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Perfect way to spend a hot day - in fact, we didn't even need sweaters in the tunnel! Bring plenty of light, sweaters just in case, and be prepared to dodge the overhead leaks that drip puddles onto the floor.  The water is cold! Once you get through the tunnel, to the other side, there are picnic tables, a garbage can, and - a few hundred feet onward - a bathroom!  Really, this is a great "easy" hike for anyone who isn't afraid of the dark.

Kendall Katwalk	LFletch	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	Beautiful piece of the PCT! I enjoyed this as a morning trail run started just after 7 am, parking lot was about 1/4 full.  There is quite a bit of smoke haze now, so views are good, but not as spectacular as true clear skies give. Trail is all in good shape and the bugs didn’t bother me at all along the trail, but I was running-which is cheating in the bug department.  At the lakes the bugs are bad. So take pictures and splash your face and run away!  	Aug 09, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-09.1008239492
Ladder Creek Falls	ToddlerTrekking	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	We hiked this at dusk to see the light show on the falls. It was very pretty and the kids had a blast. Pro tip: cover the kids in glowsticks! Fair warning, the suspension bridge over the river is a bit scary for those afraid of such things (like me) and the hike has quite a few steps. We tried to do the full loop through the gardens but that section is not lit up at night and we didn't feel comfortable in the dark.

Thank you and Happy Hiking!	Aug 09, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-14.4487530168
Jade Lake	boy_oh_boyd	Obstacles on trail:	    .	Road rough but passable	Bugs were an annoyance	A 12 mile drive up FR 4330 - Scatter Creek water level is low across road and passable by all vehicles. 10 other vehicles in Cathedral Pass parking lot at 8:30 AM on a Thursday. My planned route was Cathedral Pass Trail > Pacific Crest Trail > Marmot Lake Trail > Jade Lake Trail...then backtracking and connecting with the Deception Pass Trail all the way back to the parking lots. DAY 1: Hit the trail at 8:50 AM. Made quick work of the 2.5 miles and 1500 elevation gain to Squaw Lake, arriving at 9:50 AM. Reached the PCT intersection at 11:10 AM, 4.1 total miles and another ~600 ft. elevation. AMAZING views of Cathedral Rock! PCT started off flat, but was mostly downhill on steeper switchbacks. A tougher creek crossing at around the 7.5 mile mark. Started the Marmot Lake Trail at 1:30 PM, 9.2 miles in. Descends at first, then climbs steadily. First glimpses of Marmot Lake at 3:25 PM, 12.3 total miles, ~1500 feet elevation gain. From here, follow the lakeside trail to the South and connect with the Jade Lake Trail, often overgrown and narrow. Follow cairns to your left as you climb steeply up avalanche chutes to connect with an actual trail. The trail finally levels out as you near No Name Lake. A short 10 minute descent and there it is: the brilliant waters of Jade Lake!! 5:10 PM, my Gai GPS tracked a total of 14.68 miles. Found a great camp spot near the lake that I shared with a very friendly party to 3 and their dog. I’m not sure how this lake can handle all the overnighters that visit...I only saw 4 campsites during my scouting - might be more? - and not many for large groups. Talk to others you meet on the trail who might be able to give you a heads up. DAY 2: Left camp at 6:00 AM. Descended to the edge of Marmot Lake by 6:50 AM. PCT cutoff at 8:40 AM, 20.4 miles. North end of Hyas at 9:25 AM, 22.5 miles. Met about 20 hikers on the way down. Dozens of cars at Deception Pass Trailhead parking; same with Cathedral Pass Trailhead. Reached car - exhausted - at 10:25 AM. Final stats: 25.16 total miles, 12:34:40 total time.	Aug 09, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-12.6202728530
Heather Lake	CRL	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Hiked up to Heather Lake on a Thursday with my 8-year old for a single overnight. The road was full of pot-holes but passable, and the trail was perfectly fine the entire way. Bugs were (surprisingly) not an issue at all, but for a few black flies in the afternoon. We were the only ones at the lake overnight, which was just as well given the lack of decent tent spots.  Ours was the only one combining non-marsh lake access and sufficient tent space. Lots of relatively fresh bear scat all over, but no sightings. Overall, a magical and super easy overnight!	Aug 09, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-11.8133360915
Mount Constitution and Mountain Lake	NateWTA	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Really enjoyable hike from the Mountain Lake parking lot up to Twin Lakes, then up the steep hill to Mount Constitution. This trip, if you do it up   way (start going north up the west side of Mountain Lake, then come back down the same way) is definitely more than 6.7 miles. More like 8. But, the trip all the way up to Twin Lakes is mostly flat. Only the last 1.5 miles is steep, and it   steep! Do it in the morning, when it's cool. You do get pretty good shade the whole way up, but the temperatures don't seem to cool much from the bottom, and there's not a ton of wind while walking through the trees. Sadly, at the top, we couldn't see more than a faint outline of Mt Baker, despite a cloudless-ish day. The smoke is just too bad right now. Still a great view of the San Juan islands. We swam in a spot at the very north end of Mountain Lake. Almost perfect lake swimming. Cool, but not icy cold, and the movement of the water meant it was perfectly clear. Very little vegetation in this rocky spot. Bottom was loose sand and rocks, perfect with aquasocks. This is a great stop either going up or on the way back to refresh yourself. Not many people there, either at this swimming spot, or the hike in general. Only near the parking lot (bottom and top of Mt Constitution) did we seem many people. One deer on the way up. No mosquitos!	Aug 09, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-11.9552880815
Rialto Beach and Hole-in-the-Wall	MaryJ	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Such a beautiful area!!! I was disappointed about the hazy weather, but by sunset it cleared!!!! The parking lot was filled, even the overflow but I found a space. Nice picnic areas and bathrooms. I walked the two miles to Hole-In-The-Wall. A must to do if you go to Rialto. A lot to explore. Great picture areas!! I saw some people venture further but I didn't. 	Aug 09, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-11.4238817061
Annette Lake	skody	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	The four of us and and a very energetic Corgi had a great overnight trip up to Annette lake. Its a very easy to reach trailhead and a very well maintained trail. Annette lake is a great lake for swimming, hanging out or spending an overnight at. The lakeside is ringed with very nice campsites close to the water. Be advised there is currently a campfire restriction in affect for this area. Even though there are nice fire pits at each campsite they shouldn't be used at this time.   My real reason for writing this trip report is somewhat unfortunate.  Back behind each of the campsites on the east side of the lake there was ALOT of trash. Most of this was out of sight of the main campsites but clearly visible in the hucklyberry bushes and beyond just past the main camping areas. Tons of toilette paper, sanitary products, old clothes, bottles etc. Our group packed out a large trashbag full of garbage left behind by others.  Please remember to LEAVE NO TRACE. Anything you pack in should be packed out. A few points to remember. 1.) There is a very nice pit toilette (one of the nicest i've encountered) less than a 1/4 mile away from every camping area at the lake. It is clearly marked just past the junction with the main trail.  2.) If for some reason you cant use the pit toilette you should thoroughly bury your business and any toilette paper at least 8 inches down in a cat hole. Bring a trowel with your group and thoroughly cover your mess in such way that it cant be uncovered.  3.) Needless to say this also goes for feminine hygiene products. Picking up plastic tampon applicators and wrappers from the bushes was frankly... gross.  4.) Doing your business and leaving a rock on top of it along with half a role of TP isn't adequate. Do you really think this is going to decompose instantly and not get scattered everywhere? TP and especially wet-wipes take an entire season or more to fully decompose.  5.) Old clothes, bottles, sardine cans. etc. Obviously this all should be packed out.  If you cant be bothered to clean up after yourselves and you think its appropriate to leave your trash all over the woods.... do everyone else a favor and stay home.   	Aug 09, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-11.7268344101

Lake Valhalla	geecal	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	BUG NOTICE:  I didn't have issues with bugs, but my hiking companion was plagued by them.  It may be that I was left alone because they liked her better (not typical, I'm usually their preferred victim) or something else.  I was free of bug sprays or any other topicals - she started with sunscreen and bug bands (proved useless) and then borrowed my Deet at the lake which worked wonders for her. We left from Stevens Pass and followed the PCT.  The trail started out flat for the first 1+ miles before it began the ascent.  I was pleased that the "steep" wasn't too much and while a climb and exertion was necessary in places, it wasn't daunting.  It was up until you could see Lake Valhalla, then you descended about a half-mile down to the lake.  We set up at the far end of the "beach" and had it to ourselves briefly (due to our early start) before being joined by others. The day was hot and several of our followers went for a swim.  I hadn't brought a suit and so went with only wading - which was very refreshing.  Next time, must remember to suit up! The views were spectacular.  The hike back was also uneventful.  We met and chatted with two thru-hikers which added a different element to the hike than I've previously encountered.  It was fun hearing their tales and (hopefully) offering them accolades and encouragement.  	Aug 09, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-10.7814448303
Grand Ridge	AlpsDayTripper	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	Hiked from Deer Park to Elk Mt.  Flower report: 99% of the lupine has gone to seed. Bluebells are the most prevalent flower on the trail. There is some small pink mountain paintbrush. There are other late season flowers I don't know. Some of the flowers gone to seed are quite pretty.  I was above the little bit of smoke in the Olympics and the views were outstanding. 	Aug 09, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-10.0253214150
Poo Poo Point - Chirico Trail	karnage	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Arrived at the trailhead at 915 on a Thursday to a mostly full lot.  Took a little under two hours up and down, no obstacles on the trail and only one off leash dog today!  The haze was too much to see the mountain today, but I got my exercise.  The trail is looking a bit worse for wear with a lot of erosion going on due to the masses of the people using the trail :( #hikeathon	Aug 09, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-09.3633120408
Heather Lake	audra2121	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	If you're looking for a hike that is like Lake 22, but less people and less direct sun, this is the hike for you! Heather Lake is just as beautiful as her celebrity sister Lake 22, but has been used by far less people. First you have to get the the trail head which is an adventure in itself. I drive a sedan and I imagine it would be a load of fun to go over that road in a jeep. Once you get to the trail head you're off right away. Don't be fooled, Heather offers plenty of challenges up to her beautiful lake, roots all over the trail, wet in some places, and even a tree or two down. After a decent challenge, Heather makes it all the worth while with crystal clear water and salmon berries for days at the peak.  BUT on the serious, please keep your dog on a leash and take your poop with you. I ran into lots of dogs, only two on leash, and found a couple full poop bags left behind. Uncool.  1:05 up, :55 down	Aug 09, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-09.4718906322
Crystal Mountain Loop	elysemaher	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were terrible	Snow free	Spent the night 08/08 at Silver Springs Campground with my dog (11lb chihuahua mix). This morning we hiked up to the Summit of Crystal Mountain using Silver Creek Trail and Crystal Mountain Trail. Then we took the gondola down. I wouldn't consider it any easy hike, but a lot of it levels out or has a low grade, so you get plenty of rest between the steeper parts. I felt the hardest/steepest part was right at the beginning. Toward the end both my dog and myself were prettttty tired, though! I take her on a lot of hikes, so I wouldn't suggest bringing a small dog on this hike for their first time. It took a little less than three hours with a few 5-10 minute stops to drink water and have trail snacks. It is a gorgeous hike this time of year. The wildflowers are in bloom! Part of the trail toward the top has very little shade, so I'd advise against it on very hot afternoons, but it does cool down a bit once you get to the summit. The way the sun shines on everything in the morning is incredibly beautiful, so if you're an early riser, this is a wonderful hike. The only downside was the bugs, especially by Henskin Lake. I couldn't even stop walking there because they were so bad, and I'm usually a person who rarely gets bit.  Also, a note, I walked through a LOT of spiderwebs across the beginning of the trail. I started the hike a bit before 7am on a Thursday, so I imagine I was the first one through there in the morning, but if you are arachnophobic, I wanted to give a warning. It was mostly just webs but there were a couple little spideys that ended up in my hair. Unfortunately, at least in the morning, there was too much smoke at the top to see Mt Rainier very well but the views throughout the hike of other mountains, the wildflower meadows, etc make the hike worth it regardless of whether Rainier is viewable. I was considering taking the gondola up and hiking down, but I am really glad I chose to do it this way!	Aug 09, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-09.7709246120
Snow Lake	erinjill45	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	I started the hike at 9 am. I got to the peak around 10:30 am. I went down to the bottom of the lake around 11 am. I spent about 30-40 minutes taking pictures, eating my snacks and enjoying the scenery. I got back to the car around 1 pm. It was in the high 80 degrees F. I wore a hat, sunglasses and short sleeve dry fit. Hiking poles are helpful. I brought 2 liters of water and drank 1.5 L. I only brought a bar and an apple. I brought trail mix but didn't eat it. Many dogs and people on the trail for a weekday. The water was nice enough I saw people jumping in. Overall, I'd rate the hike as moderate. 	Aug 09, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-09.5251408747

Ira Spring Trail - Mason Lake	rachel322	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Arrived on Wednesday morning around 9:45 am. Only about 10 cars in the parking lot. Conditions were hazy (no Rainier) but the trail was still beautiful. No mosquitos at the lake but I got several flu bites along the trail and when I went swimming. Anyone know what kind of flies they are?

Mount Pugh	Michael Knoll	Minor obstacles posing few problems	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Roads:  My low-slung Toyota Prius had no problems with the forest road to the trailhead.  The unpaved part of the Mountain Loop Highway between Barlow Pass and Darrington was also in very good condition, with few potholes and only minimal washboarding. Trailhead:   The trailhead was at the second bend in the forest road, as shown on USGS topo maps -- and not where Google Maps showed it, at about 400 feet above the fourth bend.  The trailhead was clearly marked, with a reader board and sign-in sheet.  There were a few wide spots in the road for parking, but no parking lot or other amenities. Water:  The highest water along the trail was Lake Metan.  However, there were steep patches of snow on the east flank of the sharp, level ridge above Stujack Pass.  I scrambled down about 20 vertical feet from the trail to the closest of these snow patches, down-climbed the snow patch (ice ax recommended), and found running water at its base. Bugs:  A very few mosquitoes at the trailhead.  Few no no bugs at our several  rest stops in the forest below Lake Metan.  Quite a few small flies at the big boulders at the base of the open slope below Stujack Pass.   No bugs at Stujack Pass.  Lots of ladybugs at the summit, along with a few flies that were buzzing but not landing. Trail condition:  Very good to excellent.  From the trailhead at 1,900 feet to about 4,840 feet, superbly engineered trail climbs steadily through dense forest that provided cool shade.   We encountered maybe a dozen or two fallen trees, but none that were a hassle.  At 4,840 feet, the trail emerged  from the forest and switch-backed up an open slope of talus and meadow to Stujack Pass.  From the pass, the trail popped over the ridge line and followed very close to the spine of the sharp, nearly-level ridge connecting Stujack Pass with the summit block.  The trail stayed on or within 10-20 vertical feet of the ridge spine.  At the summit block the trail steepened for a while and we used our hands to scramble.  The trail remained distinct and easy to follow all the way to the summit. Crowds:  My party of two -- Don Graydon and I -- encountered two solo hikers. Footwear:  The stream at 2,200 feet near the trailhead was very small and could easily be crossed without waterproof footwear.  The creek at 2,300 feet was medium-sized.  We were wearing heavy leather climbing boots, so we just splashed through it.  I didn't notice whether there were stepping stones for non-waterproof footwear, but at the trail it was only a few inches deep at the deepest. Aesthetics:  The forest was deep, shady, and cooling.  The meadows in the open slope below Stujack Pass were teeming with flowers, including Indian paintbrush, red columbine, tiger lilies, and an exceptional number of bluebells.  From these meadows to the summit we could see many major peaks through the smoky haze.  From the summit, the most prominent peaks we could see were Glacier Peak and Sloan Peak.  The summit has a large level area with lots of seating on big rocks and at least two U.S. Geological Survey benchmark medallions. STATISTICS Source:  Gaia GPS app except as noted. Trailhead elevation:  1,867 feet (Green Trails:  1,900 feet) Summit elevation:  7,050 feet (Green Trails:  7,201 feet) Elevation gain:  5,179 vertical feet gross (Green Trails:  5,301 net) Distance:  11.20 miles round trip to summit including short side-trip scramble for water. Moving time:  7:07 hours Stopped time:  5:19 hours Total elapsed time:  12:26 hours.	Aug 08, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-09.8214059490
Spray Park	jxr	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	I arrived at Mowich Lake early and was hiking just before 7am hoping to beat the heat.  It was still quite warm even hiking through the forest before climbing up to Spray Park.  The side trip to Spray Falls was quite nice, cool and refreshing. If I hadn't been so tired going back I would have stopped again. But I had the blinders on and just wanted to get back to my vehicle so I could wash off the bug juice, sunscreen and all the dust that was clinging to me from hiking a very dry and dusty trail!  Due to the smoky haze the mountain sort of blended into the sky and was not as striking. Looking east toward Mother Mountain range made up for it as it was quite beautiful. My turn around point was sort of directly across from the range on a small ridge that goes up toward Mt. Rainier. I'm not certain what this area is called. Did I see Seattle Park?  I have no idea. :-) I was happy, tired and ready to turn back and get out of the heat.  Many of the wildflowers are past their prime but there are still some beauties to behold. Also saw several marmots out and about. They always bring a smile and are entertaining to watch.  If you are into wildflowers I'd say you better get going as this hot weather is not going to be kind to the remaining blooms.  And perhaps someone who is reading this report can tell me about the many large boulders covered in paint (red/orange/yellow colors). Are these markers for backpackers who are hiking while there is still too much snow to see the trail?  That would make sense and I'm hoping that is the reason.  Will certainly do this hike again. 	Aug 08, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-09.6152272851

Bertha May and Granite Lakes	Ayerfamily	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were terrible	Snow free	We drove almost to the parking lot but decided to park on the side and hike in the last 1/3 mile because I was worried about the clearance of our minivan. Saw what was either a small bear or badger (?) when we were driving in. The flies were really bad and the kids whined a good part of the time (the younger ones), but once we got to Granite Lake and went for a swim, all was fine. A few berries were ripening along the way, and the trees provided a good deal of shade on a very warm day. Well maintained trail and not much traffic midweek. We hope to return and camp at Granite Lake.	Aug 08, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-08.0522271869
Park Butte	LSM50	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	The gravel forest roads were VERY slow, with lots of impressive potholes. Not advised for low-clearance cars. The parking lot was almost full at 9:50 on a weekday.  The privies at the trailhead were clean and very welcome. We had perfect weather, with glorious views of Mt. Baker and many other snow-capped peaks.  A smoky haze flooded in just as we got to the lookout. There were tons of huckleberries, some of which were ripe enough to pick and eat.  Yum!  Next week should provide a feast. Not much bird activity.  Heard two olive-sided flycatchers near the trailhead.  Also heard a pica near one of the upper meadows. Wildflowers on the upper meadows were spectacular, especially with Mt. Baker's glaciers as a backdrop. The trail was in very good condition all the way up, but very dusty.  There were a few brief rocky places, especially when crossing old and current stream beds.

Old Man's Trail	EmilB	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Arrived about 10 AM on a sunny Wednesday; plenty of parking in Sky Country lot.  Trails were peaceful and beautiful.  I heard/saw a pileated woodpecker.  They are very common here; just follow the sound of their tapping. Per Garmin,  . : I recommend wearing long pants and  .  This area is home to small, silent flies that try to bite your calves (where blood pressure is high).  They can get in under lose clothes (where mosquitoes can't) and their bites are small, irritating, and last for days.  I find that if I take precautions, I don't get bites.  When I'm careless and get bites, a paste of ground of aspirin and water under a band-aid over the bite eases the itching. : There is an event out of the Sky Country trail head 8/11, so parking will be a challenge and the area will be a raucous mob scene. : Blind corners and drivers disregarding traffic directionality create Sky Country parking lot hazards.  Every stretch of the figure-8-shaped lot is a one-way (see the attached picture).  Directionality is indicated with traffic signs and pavement arrows.  However, people frequently drive against the one-ways.  We’ve all disregarded parking lot traffic signs, but the lot has blind corners that are only safe when directionality is followed.  I have seen people charging excitedly into the parking lot and around blind corners with the confidence they have the right-of-way to the whole lane.  I have also seen people in a hurry to get home drive furiously around the same blind corners the wrong way.  At some point, people will collide.  So, do not be one of those people; recognize that, once you are in the parking lot, Mad Max rules apply and drive cautiously around every corner assuming someone could be hurtling against the one-way toward you.

Church Mountain	D-Rock	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were terrible	Snow free	Ran/hiked up. The raid up has one steep section with a little water over the roadway but most can make it just fine. Once in the trail the bugs were bad when we stopped and dine if running but when hiking it was an annoyance. The day was a beautiful summer day and we encountered 4 or 5 other hikers. Yes the hike is steep but it is constant and manageable to the meadows and doesn’t look as steep as it feels. The thin air does make it a bit harder for sure. The top scramble is clearly not runnable but it’s only a couple hundred feet and easy enough if you follow the trail. The meadow and top views are had to beat. If you are considering this hike, don’t overthink it. It’s not flat, but well worth it after the 2.5 miles through the trees.

Red Mountain (Commonwealth Basin)	cflash	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	Hiked this for the first time Aug. 8. I was pleasantly surprised. I started at the PCT North trailhead off I-90 Exit 52 and hiked toward Kendall Katwalk until a Y in the road marked by a "Commonwealth Basin" sign (no Red Mountain sign at all). Head left at the Y and follow the trail. Trail was in excellent condition, including having to cross a couple of trickling streams, which presented no problem. The hike up wasn't too strenuous, but offered a good climb. I got to nibble on a few salmon berries along the way, which surprisingly haven't all been picked by people or bears. Bugs started bugging me at the Red Mountain lookout and got a bit worse as hiked toward the Lundin Peak lookout (not marked). Visibility was a bit impaired by the haze from the forest fires (see photo), but it was still worth seeing! Even though the temps hit above 85, we brought plenty of water to keep us hydrated so it really wasn't that bad. I'll be back!

Twin Firs Loop	Taum Sauk	Trail difficult/impossible to navigate:	    Trees down across trail.	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Twin Firs Bushwhack We entered Mount Rainier National Park about 2:15 pm. Our first stop was the Twin Firs trail. We made the mistake of attempting a counterclockwise loop and taking a trail to the right, which had a large tree fallen across it, and we climbed over the tree and soon ran out of trail! Apparently this is not the main trail. We bushwhacked our way in a loop back to the trailhead. Our loop was 0.4 miles, but we climbed over blowdowns and made our way through brush until we got back to trail. When we got back, we determined where we should have gone (straight or to the left), but we had another, longer hike in mind and resolved to finish this one later. Because of the ambiguous trailhead, I marked this hike "difficult to navigate." Along the way, we marveled at old growth (OG), giant blowdowns, moss, seedlings, and groundcover. The flora consists of Douglas fir, western hemlock, red cedar, red huckleberry, deer fern, sword fern, and Cascade Oregon-grape. The trail, where we were on it, is in relatively good condition. We have to give a shout-out to the ladies at the Copper Creek Inn in Ashford. We had initially planned a trip to Glacier View on FR-59, but we had a flat tire on the FR, and we changed our tire at the Inn's parking area. We had lunch there, and the ladies at the Inn brought us an air compressor to attempt inflation of our spare tire. We had great food and service above and beyond the call of duty.

Curry Gap	joejoezz	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	Trail running loop starting at North Fork Sauk trailhead covering 28 miles and 7,500 ft of gain. The NF Sauk road to the trailhead is in good shape, I had no issues getting my Prius to the trailhead although there are 2-3 spots with old washouts that require care.  I did the loop counter-clockwise starting at N Fork Sauk TH although next time I would probably go clockwise. After 3 miles on FS road 49, the Curry Gap trail (650) continues with a smooth uphill on a old road grade. I quickly reached 3900 ft at Curry Gap which is overgrown with wildflowers but easy to navigate. Turning left in a field at a marked junction just past a campsite, the Bald Eagle trail begins with switchbacks and excellent views of Monte Cristo. This section is also slightly overgrown but the tread of the trail is in good shape.  The real treat begins upon reaching the ridgeline around 8.5 miles in. The next 5 miles were mostly smooth, runnable uphill through meadows with views to the south and occasionally north toward Glacier Peak. I took a slight detour at 13.5 to summit June Mountain and get some additional views. Almost immediately after June Mtn there is a left on the Pilot Ridge trail which begins with a 900' rocky descent and passes just to the left of lower Blue Lake where I accidentally turned toward the campsites at the lake but quickly corrected myself. Make sure to top off your water supply in this area since there is none on Pilot Ridge.  After a brief stop at the lake (any extended stop was met with swarms of bugs), the trail ascends smoothly upward toward Pilot Ridge. Stay left again where the Blue Lake trail veers off. After another big switchback there is signed right turn option toward Johnson Mountain. I took the side trip which was about 1.2 miles and 650' of extra gain. Well worth the extra effort for the marmots and fantastic views atop Johnson Mtn, even with a bit of wildfire smoke obscuring the more distant peaks.  Upon returning to the Pilot Ridge trail there were two small snowfield crossings that were easy to navigate and will be gone soon. This section of Pilot Ridge was the best of the entire loop, 5 miles of smooth running with mixed up/downhills. It was HOT out there and I started to get low on water and thought I was beginning the descent to the Sauk, but the trail surprised me with a final 400' climb that required a couple of brief rests. On the actual descent there is a water source at ~4,500 ft. At this point I saw 2 backpackers who were the first people I had seen the entire day! The steep trail down Pilot Ridge is hard on tired legs which is why one might prefer to do this loop in the other direction with the softer descent down to Curry Gap. There are several big logs over the Sauk which make for an easy crossing. The final 1.9 miles on the N Fork Sauk trail feature numerous old grown Firs and Cedars--a perfect way to end a long day. 	Aug 08, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-09.5053151220
Mount Dickerman	Norhiker	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	Nothing much to add that is not in previous trip reports. Was a bit brutal on a nearly breezeless 90-degree day--bring more than enough water, there is none on trail. Profusion of flowers once you hit the alpine meadows. Views spectacular despite smoke haze in the distance. Note: I only saw 2 plastic bags of dog poop beside the trail during this hike. That was better than the half-dozen I often see. Don't leave your dog poop bags on the trail intending to pick them up on your way back down, people (I assume that's why they get left?). Your dog poops, you scoop it up and immediately put it in an airtight container/bag in your backpack. Don't "leave it for later," don't litter.

Glacier Basin	MMPP	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Good hike on 90 degree day, as ~80% of trail is in the woods.  Good paved road to trail head, and big parking lot at Campground there.  A few trail-side waterfalls & brook crossings also provided welcome moments of cool on the gentle but steady climb. The little spur off to Emmons Glacier (45 min. RT) was fine, but not really necessary as you still see the glacier at the top.  Bugs (little flies, not mosquitoes) definitely out, but with DEET spray and the help of constant light breeze at the top, they were just mildly annoying. 2 minute hop down to the river from the meadow provided more cooling after lunch.  Good trail conditions, waning wildflowers now, but Paintbrush and Asters as we got higher.  Bears had been sighted (w/ cubs) recently but we saw no wildlife other than very, very confident chipmunks.

Franklin Falls	Gjack	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	We hiked Franklin Falls early this morning and had the place to ourselves. The trail is a nice easy walk.

Railroad Grade	Lucy	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	No bugs	Snow free	This hike never disappoints. The road however is another story. It has many potholes, typical for a forest service road. The trail starts out level. Blueberry bushes are starting to show decent berries along the way. The trail crosses a dry bed of rocks and there are a couple of different ways to reconnect with the trail. It is not difficult to follow the main trail even if you go off course a short distance. You will reach a metal bridge to cross a creek, and again you will find the trail if you follow the beaten path. The trail leads into the forest that has a gradual incline. There are well placed rock and wooden steps helping you advance uphill. At 2 miles there is a junction with choices of going to the lookout, Scott Paul trail or Railroad Grade. We choose Railroad Grade today. The meadows encountered after the junction are devoid of blooming flowers but that doesn't deter from the great views of Mount Baker. The path leads onto the narrow ridge that eventually guides you to the glaciers of Mount Baker and its surrounding peaks. While the skies were hazy in certain views, Mount Baker remained beautiful.  Reaching the climbers camp, it was busy with lots of tents up and people practicing their climbing skills on the lower glacier. Despite the number of climbers and hikers around it was easy to find a spot of solitude. After stopping for lunch, we explored the area and we found more snow melted water holes and peaks to enjoy. The breezes off of the glaciers were a welcomed relief to the heat.  Hike this area and enjoy the great close up views of the glaciers. We didn't venture up to the lookout on this trip but that is another great trail to explore. Great day with great views and no bugs. 	Aug 08, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-08.4163874549
Deer Creek Pass	austineats	Trail difficult/impossible to navigate:	    Trees down across trail,	    Overgrown in places.	Road impassable/closed	Today was a day with an objective, Helena Peak. Road and trail conditions didn't really matter as we were climbing a peak. The Deer Creek road is completely washed out 2 miles in leaving another 2 miles to navigate. We took bikes and were happy for it. It wasn't 'easy' riding. Trail #717 was moderately to severely overgrown. The Helena Mines trail, which ascends to ~4500' on Helena's west side, is extremely overgrown. We didn't let these silly details stop us from having a fabulous time. We had wildflowers, we had salmon berries and huckleberries to our heart's content. And then we had steep and overgrown. Some trip reports state that there is plentiful 'flagging' on this route, we saw maybe 10 pieces in 3.5 miles. On a plus side this route is largely in the shade until we reached the saddle. We enjoyed visiting the old mines. Sadly we didn't find the old wheel which I've seen pictured in on-line reports. Since this trip I have reviewed another mapping source which shows multiple mines that we missed as well as a cabin site. The terrain here is far too steep for logging so there are many enormous hemlocks.  The summit has seen just two other parties this year. Ironically we ran into a Mountaineers group going up as we descended. I would not recommend going past the mines without significant crosscountry/scrambling experience.

Chain Lakes Loop	geezerhiker	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Intermittent snow - not hard to cross	The mountain weather forecast I checked said the high temperature at 5,000' on Mt. Baker would be 70 degrees F. today.  I think the 70 should have been a 90 because that what it was on the rocks in the basin.  Many hikers coming up from the Visitor Center were baking... As I was approaching Heather Meadows in my car, in less than 1/2 mile from Galena Falls a bear cub, a furry fawn, and a pika all crossed the road right in front of me.  That was an interesting beginning to my adventure for the day. I planned an overnight hike to Ptarmigan Ridge.  It was 73 degrees when I arrived at the Artist Point parking lot at 7:30AM.  By the time I reached the Chain Lakes Loop (CLL) junction at 8AM, the temperature was 80 degrees.  I would have had full exposure to the heat on the Ptarmigan Ridge trail, so I opted to hike the CLL trail.  The mountains were crystal clear in the morning and the lakes were calm.  The back side of the CLL trail was in the trees and shade, so it was cool.  There were not many hikers until I reached Herman's Saddle.  From there to the finish, I encountered many hikers sweating their way up the trail.  I prefer to start at Artist Point and go down at the Saddle. The views in opposite directions from the Saddle were outstanding today. The heat made hiking difficult.  I went slower than normal, drank plenty of water, and did not suffer any adverse effects.  While most hikers wore shorts and tank tops, I prefer long pants and long sleeves that wick moisture and keep sweat from evaporating quickly.  You feel warmer, but you stay cooler. I hitched a ride from the Visitors Center up to Artist Point.  The loop was enough exercise for me today. I'm glad that I chose the CLL trail.  It was very beautiful this morning. The wildfire haze set in and diminished the views just as I ended my hike.  I'm glad that I'm a morning person.

Redmond Ridge	karnage	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	We park at Redmond Ridge Park and walk south to the wide paved trail that runs alongside Redmond Ridge Drive.  There are foot paths off to the side that enter the trees to access the soft surface trails.  Those trails are shared with horses, so please pay attention!  There are many trails back here, lined with huckleberries, that enter and exut neighborhoods and even access a grocery store.  I do not know the complete mileage of the trail system, but I believe you can access the powerline trail that enters the Redmond Watershed Nature Preserve (no dogs allowed there).  The trails are flat with basically no obstacles and are teeming with a variety of fungus in the fall.  The paved trail along the street is stroller friendly, but I wouldn't bring it onto the soft surface trails.

Columbia River Waterfront Renaissance Trail	Sunrise Creek	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	We hiked 4.5 miles in a mixed configuration of the Columbia River Renaissance Trail and Discovery Historic Loop along the Columbia River waterfront and through Fort Vancouver National Historic Site, Officer's Row and downtown Vancouver. #hikeathon I like to park on East 5th Street near the restored Fort Vancouver Stockade. Street parking is ample, free and there aren't any time limits. We started out by taking the paved path south through the Orchard to the Land Bridge, where we crossed over S-R 14. At the Old Apple Tree Park we took the underpass under the railroad tracks over to the Columbia River Renaissance Trail. We hiked east along the Columbia River to the statue of Ilchee, a Chinookan woman. The air was warming quickly on this day with an excessive heat warning, so we turned around and headed west, back to the shady promenade along Columbia Way. We passed under the I-5 Bridge, turned north at Terminal One, then continued east on Columbia Way to the new waterfront development. The first four buildings, a mixed-use combination of hotels, restaurants, condominiums and offices, are under construction. A waterfront park and a 90-foot-long suspended pier are set to be dedicated at the end of September. We took a look, then headed up Esther Street, passing under the railroad again, to Esther Short Park, where we could walk across cool grass under big shade trees. We detoured to the statue of explorer Captain George Vancouver, who named so many significant landmarks in our state. Crews were setting up for the summer weekly noon concert. We cut north to Evergreen Blvd and then walked east past the Vancouver Community Library and The Academy, where WTA has its Southwest Region Office. We crossed over I-5 on the overpass and entered another shady area of big, old trees along Officer's Row. We turned at the O.O. Howard House to walk through the rose garden, then walked past the Gifford Pinchot National Forest headquarters in the Artillery Barracks in the East Barracks. We stayed on grass as much as possible since the pavement was getting warm for doggy paws and walked down the Great Meadow back to East 5th Street and the close of our loop.

Caribou Ridge Hike #79	ChrisB	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	The Caribou Ridge Trail #79, in the Coeur d'Alene National Forest, is a 10 mile round trip, taking you to the summit of Mt. Coeur d'Alene.  Elevation gain is ± 2300 feet.  (High point is 4430.) There are a couple options to extend this hike, and we did it as a "lollipop", for 14.5 miles total.  We started on Trail #79, from the Beauty Bay Campground.  Trail was rocky, dusty and uneven in places, but very doable.  The trail switchbacks for the first 1½ miles, then turns away from the canyon and follows the ridge through fairly easy hiking country.  Views of Lake Coeur d'Alene and the mountains of northern Idaho are pleasant sights.  At about the 3 mile point, look for a small sign indicating trail 258.  Make the left and for about 3 miles, enjoy the flat trail, before climbing again on trail 257, and meeting up with the forest service road.  Take a right here, ignore the couple of side trails and continue for a couple of miles to the picnic area.  From here, take the ½ mile to the summit, no views, just remnants of a shack and concrete pad.  When you're ready to return to the trailhead, locate trail #79 to the left of the picnic area, back to the cars!

Skyline Trail Loop	Jennekehikes	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Intermittent snow - not hard to cross	We hiked Skyline clockwise from the Paradise Inn, starting at 5:45 with morning's first light and sunrise guiding the way. We spent over three hours on trail before meeting another hiker, and had Glacier Vista and Panorama Point entirely to ourselves. The wildflower haze limited visibility, so Adams and St. Helens were hiding from us, but there was still plenty of beauty to be had in the stunning views, waterfalls,  Marmots were out feasting on flowers, ground squirrels were persistent little beggars up at Panorama Point (no food for you, squirrels!). Lower Skyline is roped off, so the loop necessitates the climb to Upper Skyline - for some of the most wonderful up close views of Rainier available at Paradise (without heading up to Camp Muir and beyond, of course). Bugs were definitely an annoyance, the hike is exposed, and we were very happy to be getting off trail in the late morning as the day was getting hot! Bring extra water and sun protection, and enjoy this spectacular Rainier hike. The sound of construction from the work being done on the Annex is ever present throughout the work day, but quiet can still be found in Paradise before 8am and after 4pm.

Skyline Trail Loop	audg86	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Intermittent snow - not hard to cross	Got a bit later start than I wanted and arrived at Paradise just after 9:30. Upper parking lot was full already, even on a Wednesday, but got one of the first side spots along the road.  I did the Skyline Loop clockwise. It was a HOT day and a ranger at the trailhead was reminding everyone to carry plenty of water. The first bit to Glacier Vista had a ton of gorgeous views. Panorama Point was also beautiful, but it was very hazy due to wildfires, so those distant mountain views were missing. Seems like most people took the Golden Gate cutoff instead of the full loop, but the extra mile seems worth it. Meadows, wildflowers, and an extra waterfall. Finished the hike with a Rainier beer, of course.	Aug 08, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-09.7367240201
Granite Lakes	Avatar	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Headed up around 6:00 in the evening on a Wednesday night; only one other car in the parking lot (where there is an outhouse if needed), and saw that pair of folks heading out. The climb out of the parking lot is somewhat steep fairly quickly, but the trail is in incredible shape. Major kudos to the workparty that made this trail -- it is awesome. There were TONS of ripe thimbleberries everywhere, along the whole trail. Only saw blackberries once along the trail, and they were small and not very good at all. There were also some blueberry plants I noticed right around the lake, but they're still a little early to be very good yet. A few wildflowers out too: sitka valerian, oxeye daisies, some purple thing that might have been bluebells or larkspur or lungwort or something else (I don't really know flowers). Got to the lake around 7:30 with a moderate pace. There was a horsefly that came to annoy me during the walk for a while (got me to flail wildly at it and knock my glasses off into the bushes, not once, but TWICE -- I'm a slow learner, apparently). After I stopped to take my pack off and get out a frisbee to show it I wasn't playing games anymore (ironic?), and if it came back its end would be nigh... it disappeared. Figures. All of the 20 or so water crossings were mostly just small trickles across the path with easy stepping stones. One could definitely keep one's feet dry the whole way. Best water source, though, was right after the second trail split, about .4 miles from the lake -- strong, clear stream that the trail crosses over. Lake was entirely mine from dusk to dawn (saw one other hiker heading up with her pup in the morning), so I took advantage with a little swimming -- water is pleasantly warm on the top, and pleasantly cool when one gets down 2 or 3 feet. Only a couple mosquitoes right at dusk. REALLY not bad fly-wise at all -- I was impressed.	Aug 08, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-09.6122132759
Annette Lake	Caçula S	Obstacles on trail:	    Trees down across trail.	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Hiked to the lake at 9am and it felt warm already. First two miles climbed at steeper than expected incline while last mile and a half was a little more level.  Lots of roots and rocks on trail.  We jumped into the lake which was refreshingly cold.  Saw three campsites that were unoccupied.  Lots of huckleberries in the last mile and a half.  THere are a couple of log crossings as well as three downed trees on the trail.  	Aug 08, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-08.1076583827
Barclay Lake	ninjaracerchick	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	I put that the road is in good condition because compared to most others it is, there is some washboarding and a few good sized potholes but it’s in pretty good shape. Trail is in good shape, no issues to speak of. Can believe how dry it’s getting already, I’ve done this hike many different times of the year and have never seen the creek with the bridge dried up until now! There are ripe huckle and salmon berries along the trail. Lake is a little on the low side but still beautiful! Great short hike or hike with kids!

Lake Dorothy - Lake Bear - Lake Deer	JRhikes	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	The trail surface has a little bit of everything - dirt, rocks, roots, and steps, lots of steps. There are steps made from stones, log berms, and wood planks and you'll find them all the way past Lake Dorothy onto the trail to Bear Lake (although the number rapidly declines after Dorothy). The trail to Lake Dorothy is relatively easy and I thought I might actually make it all the way to Snoqualmie Lake, but once you cross the inlet at the south end of the lake, the trail becomes much more difficult, rough, narrow, and steep. There is a very large tree down across the trail on the way down to Bear Lake. There is one notch cut into it for a foot, but it was quite the climb for me being on the short side. I made it to the rock fall just past Deer Lake where I got a glimpse of Snoqualmie far below then turned around. This was the first trail I've been on where there were more backpackers than day hikers. Also of note is the amount of exposure to the sun (and I would assume rain) on the trail. It warmed up very quickly once the sun was high enough.	Aug 08, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-08.8831019923
Bullion Basin	granitemountain	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	awesome hiking route right out of the Crystal Mountain Parking lot; not a lot of attention to this.  This was a great loop with tons of huge wildflower fields, and what would have been amazing views if it weren't for the wildfire haze.  Not much info on these trails and I'm not sure why.  It was a great hike.  I got a PDF map from the crystal mountain website and this was my route. Followed the sign for Silver Creek/Bullion basin trails to the left of the chapel at the parking lot.  Walked up a trail/road for 5 min or so, and came onto a gravel road and the separate labeled trail heads for both Silver Creek and Bullion Basin.   Followed Bullion basin trail, quickly crossing a road, and climbed for about 90 min until a junction with the PCT that was labeled with a sign for the Bullion Basin trail I just entered on.  The Bullion Basin trail appeared to continue beyond this.  A few side trails along the way were obviously blocked off.  Many great wildflower fields.  Took a right on the PCT and it was true crest hiking, flat along ridge line with views alternating sides, and eventually it descended a bit.   60 min of breathtaking hiking on the PCT, after passing a Fog City trail on the left,  came to a clearly marked 5 way junction  (PCTN, PCTS, Henskin Lake, Silver Creek back to base, and Bear Gap trail to who knows).  Continued on the PCT S over the gap and along a trail that hugged the upper slopes of mountains, thru screefields and dirt and  after an hour from the 5 way junction, arrived at Sourdough gap and went over the saddles to both Crystal Lakes, and Sheep lakes back before this but didn't go down much to either.  Returned the way I came, and at the 5 way junction, took the Silver Creek Trail back to Crystal Mountain Base.   	Aug 08, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-08.3353684498

Minotaur Lake	heidi1	Minor obstacles posing few problems	Road rough but passable	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	Great hike up to Lake Minotaur. The trail is steep but short (3.5 miles roundtrip) and so absolutely stunning when you hit the lake. It takes your breath away.  It took us, at a moderate pace, with few stops about an hour and 15 minutes to go up. About an hour coming down. No one was on the trail. We had the glacier fed lake all to ourselves. Temperatures in the valley below neared 104 degrees. We were perfect at about 85 degrees.  We had three dogs that swam and enjoyed the creek to the right going up, the pond before Minotaur Lake and, of course, the lake itself.  Fish were jumping.  Along the way there were many wild flowers but the fireweed was the most prevalent.  The blueberry bushes near the top were stripped clean. Not even a hint of a berry on them.  Bears? :)  	Aug 08, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-08.8791071472
Twin Lakes and Lake Lillian	yomama	Minor obstacles posing few problems	Road rough but passable	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	Hot, hot hike to Twin Lakes. Meant to get to Lake Lillian but turned around after Twin Lakes which offered good swimming. Cool and refreshing despite the relatively shallowness. Lots of bugs but they stopped annoying us by 3pm- guess it was too hot for them! Nice hike once we got past the 2 miles of logging road and clear-cut- but this hike better done on a cooler day.

Spray Park Loop	SeaRick1	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were an annoyance	Intermittent snow - not hard to cross	My party of 5 left downtown Seattle at 6am with only light traffic and made it to the Mowich lake Rd in about an hour. Having just bought a new Accord I wasn't thrilled to see so much washboard on gravel road making the last 15 miles or so very slow. I'd recommend a crossover or suv for the next time. Mowich lake was sunlit and placid when we arrived giving us all excitement for the rest of the days views. We started the Spray Park Loop trail counter clockwise and soon found overlooks and waterfalls that leave even PNW residents breathless. A few easy switchbacks to the plateau and then a few easy snow field crossings with many Avalanche Lilies and other wildflowers. In shady areas near water the bugs were thick, we used spray to keep them at bay. We intended to have lunch near a waterfall and then head back the way we came but soon ran into a party of hikers who said there was a magnificent waterfall just 1.5 miles further down the trail so that became our destination. We never found those falls but we thought we may have heard them thru the dense forest. We all agreed they had duped us into searching...By this point we were half way around the loop so we voted and opted to do the full loop. A very cool suspension bridge over the Carbon River and then a quite difficult final 5 miles up the Ipsut creek trail to reconnect at Mowich lake. It's almost like the Olympic peninsula rain forests here with many moss covered rocks and small waterfalls. Remember to pack a lot of water/filters/tablets as you sweat a lot. We ended up leaving at around sunset with more gorgeous views of the mountain in the rear view mirrors.	Aug 08, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-08.2283823883

Mount Kent	Nastassia	Trail difficult/impossible to navigate:	    .	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were terrible	had a fun scramble/bushwhack! lots of blueberries. taking the talus field down to the forest service road that you can nearly see from the fork seemed easier, and that's the way we took back. either way there really just isn't much of a trail (even a faint one) after the fork off the McClellan trail but we still navigated it just fine in the dark. no super technical anything, just lots of wobbly talus and slippery dirt and trees.

South Coast Wilderness Trail - Toleak Point	PNWHiker	Minor obstacles posing few problems	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	So many logistics for this hike, starting with reserving a shuttle for the day you will actually need it, instead of boneheadedly reserving it for the day you're leaving Seattle, which was the day   to the day we'd be parking at Oil City (assuming a car-camp the night before). Very fortunately, another party booked a shuttle on the correct day, and there was room for us. You should also account for being at Pt. Angeles WIC between 8 and 5, and the fact that there's likely a line for the ferry you'll want from Seattle, even midweek, in summer. Failing both of these, our family of two adults and one 13-yo spent our first night at a Pt. Angeles motel, ready for the 8 a.m. permit lineup (pro tip: back door opens at 8:00; be there by 7:45 and plan on half an hour to wait your turn for your permits, bear canister, and the lecture admonishing you not to feed, pet, nor   the wildlife (if the rangers have to say this, it really makes you wonder about people). If you have your own canister, you can take care of your permit after hours at the WIC or the trailhead (mail your payment): $8 per night, per person over age 16. Currently there's a burn ban: no beach fires. It's about an hour and 40 minute drive from Pt. Angeles to the Oil City TH, and since it was nearly 9:00 by the time we were underway, I thought it would be prudent to call ahead and assure the shuttle company (Olympic Hiking Company) that we were on our way -- in case we arrived past 10:45 for our 11:00 ride. It's then that we learned they'd expected us yesterday, but that we could ride along today instead. Wow, that was lucky. Because if it hadn't been for that other party, we would have been stuck at Oil City waiting for a shuttle that would not have come. Family vacation disaster averted! The shuttle takes less than an hour (funny to think that it would take us days to cover the same distance along the beach by foot). We were on the Third Beach trail around noon, following the ebb tide for the entire 6.4 route to Toleak Point. Overland trails for Taylor Point and Scotts Bluff were not muddy, but ascent/descent is steep, sometimes with very long steps, so the ropes and ladders make a handy self-belay. Sun was shining all day, and the sea stacks at Giants Graveyard were stunning. Several parties camped at Third Beach, some at Strawberry Point (no water source), and also at Toleak Point, but we had no difficulty finding a camp spot on the sand near the Jackson Creek logjam. Fog rolled in during the night and condensed on tree branches above our bivy sacks. Note to self: next time, place bivy in the open to stay drier. The next day we hiked 4.6 miles to Mosquito Creek, following the overland trail that fords Falls and Goodman creeks. These were easily crossed via stepping stones -- dry feet. There was only one other party camping at Mosquito Creek. There is room on the beach near the mouth of the creek, but overnight high tide was to be above 9 feet, and that party decided it would be less nerve wracking to camp in the forest on the bluff, to the south of the creek. Again, we had a late start and followed the ebb tide our entire hike, mindful of advice to cross Mosquito Creek at low tide. The Park Service warns of "knee to waist deep" ford, but for us it barely reached our ankles. We opted to camp at the first spot available on the bluff, just north of the large group site that the other party occupied (pit toilet is there). We preferred a forest campsite to sand, particularly since there was no view due to fog. About an hour before sunset, however, the fog finally burned off and we were treated to a beautiful show. Our original plan was for a 3-night trip, with the last campsite at Jefferson Cove. The Park ranger advised against camping there, and showed me what looked like campsites marked on the stretch of beach just north of Hoh Head. My Custom Correct map, however, makes it look like you really want to use the overland trail... any beach access would be an unmarked scramble, and besides, the high tide for our 3rd night was set to be well above 9 feet; we weren't sure there would be enough beach to camp. Instead, on our third day, we hiked the whole 6.5 miles from Mosquito Creek to the Oil City TH, doing our best to time the headlands near Diamond Rock for the 6:20 p.m. 1.8-foot low tide. The trail over Hoh Head gave us red huckleberries and salal berries to feast on. The route descends to Jefferson Cove via rope ladder; unfortunately, this ladder terminates at a yellow-jacket nest. My son stirred them up when he dropped his camera, got stung on his hand. My husband, following, also got stung -- but was able to retrieve the camera via trekking pole (yay, dad!). I waited for everyone to calm down and stepped in the vegetation way to the right (facing the hill), and avoided being stung. We dilly-dallied along the Jefferson Cove beach, waiting for the tide to expose a route around the 2-foot-highwater headland. Our weather radio told us there was a storm moving in, and given that our tide table was set for Destruction Island, some miles to the south, we considered that a 1.8-foot low might not pan out as being below 2 feet for us. We scouted out the boulders as the tide retreated, noticed a rope and webbing up a Class 3 gully, and conjured plans B, C, and D in the event that the tide prevented us from rounding the headland. One of these plans involved retreating back to Jefferson Cove and finding the highest-possible patch of level ground for a bivy that might be dry despite the very high midnight tide, and then ducking out the next morning on the minus tide. Barnacles provide traction when negotiating beach boulders, but the thought of reaching out a hand to catch your balance on barnacles is disconcerting. We had brought gloves for the rope ladders (and not used them); they were very serviceable amongst the rocks. By 4:00 the tide had retreated enough that we could mostly avoid slippery rocks and we pressed ahead to make as much progress as possible on the ebbing tide. Within minutes, we encountered a group rounding the headland from the other direction: a family of 2 adults and 3 kids, elementary- to middle-school age, who said they had been waiting 6 hours for the tide to let them pass. Then we encountered another party of 2, then another. We finished rounding the headland, as well as the 3-foot-highwater one just past Diamond Rock, in about an hour, and then we walked the cobble beach the rest of the way to the mouth of the Hoh where the beach is littered with titanic stumps. We could have camped here, amongst the logs, but with rain in the forecast, and so near our car, we opted instead for warm showers and real beds at the Port Angeles Red Lion. In my defense for wimping out, this was my son's first trip carrying a full load; I want him to want to do more of these. I am not above bribing him with the prospect of restaurant food and cable TV at trip's end. Oh! On the drive back up 101 we saw a cow elk and two calves. 	Aug 08, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-12.5086219477
Big Four Ice Caves	outdoormama	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Friends invited us to do this nice easy "hike" with them.  We had a large group of kids/moms/grandmas and it was very doable for all.  It was especially fun to play in the river on the way back.  Just as a reminder, they do not sell Trail Passes at the Trailhead and the Ranger Station is closed on Wednesdays so plan ahead to print a day pass online or purchase an annual pass before you come. There was also a Mama/baby black bear sighting Tuesday August 7th, so be aware and keep dogs on leash!	Aug 08, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-11.8160664073
Skyline Trail Loop	audg86	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Intermittent snow - not hard to cross	Got a bit later start than I wanted and arrived at Paradise just after 9:30. Upper parking lot was full already, even on a Wednesday, but got one of the first side spots along the road.  I did the Skyline Loop clockwise. It was a HOT day and a ranger at the trailhead was reminding everyone to carry plenty of water. The first bit to Glacier Vista had a ton of gorgeous views. Panorama Point was also beautiful, but it was very hazy due to wildfires, so those distant mountain views were missing. Seems like most people took the Golden Gate cutoff instead of the full loop, but the extra mile seems worth it. Meadows, wildflowers, and an extra waterfall. Finished the hike with a Rainier beer, of course.	Aug 08, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-09.5386448269

Burroughs Mountain	seabeav	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	I hiked to 2nd Burroughs many years ago and decided to introduce this spectacular trail to some friends...this time including 3rd Burroughs. Even with hazy skies, as correctly forecast by NOAA, this was an amazing hike. My friends and I were not disappointed.  We hiked counter-clockwise up along Sourdough Ridge, took the Burroughs trail up to 3rd Burroughs and returned to Sunrise along the Sunrise Rim Trail. The open, exposed views of Rainier, Little Tahoma, Fremont Lookout, Skyscraper Mountain and more stopped us in our tracks many times to stare...often having to crane our necks to look up at the summit of Rainier. The return along the lower trail treated us to a profusion of Cascade asters and other wildflowers. The 'in your face' views of Rainier, Winthrop and Emmons Glaciers and other geomorphological wonders made this a truly amazing hike. A comment...even though the trail up to 3rd Burroughs, as you stand contemplating it after your trek to 2nd Burroughs, can appear to be quite daunting.... it is worth the effort if you have the time and energy to do it. Imagine standing below Rainier on 3rd Burrows and looking down on Winthrop glacier 2000 feet below. If you return along the Sunrise Rim trail, take the time to stare at the toe of Emmons Glacier and the huge lateral moraine running up the mountain along its side. Think about the magnitude and power of the massive glacier over time as it retreated up the mountain leaving a gigantic wall of glacial debris in its wake.  And as you continue down the trail, get ready for a profusion (at least now) of wildflowers along the trail and meadows. Wildflowers along this part of the trail (and along the trails between the Burroughs) include orange, red and magenta paintbrush, Cascade asters, penstemon, lupine, dwarf lupine and others. Watch for pasqueflower plants now in their strange seedpod stage. Bugs were around but not too bad. I only applied repellent when the horseflies seemed to linger longer around my ears on the way up to 3rd Burroughs. However, while on 3rd Burroughs we were greeted with minor swarms of lady bugs...I had not seen that before. Interesting, but not really annoying, as they lit on our arms, legs and backs and watched us eat lunch. You can tell by now that I really like this hike! On a sunny, clear day (forecast next week) it will be even better. Do this one if you get the chance.

Skyline Trail Loop	Todd@toddaagard.com	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Intermittent snow - not hard to cross	Always a classic. So good. Hazy day due to the fires, but not bad. Peak wild flower season has come and gone. This weekend will be the last chance to see some of the darker reds and purples. I would still suggest going to see the flowers . . But not past Sunday. Paradise Inn for lunch is not good . . Would not recommend.

Carter Falls	Taum Sauk	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Prior to our Carter Falls hike, we visited Longmire Museum and Wilderness Information Center. The ranger gave us an information sheet (trail descriptions on one side, map on the other) regarding the trails in the vicinity of Longmire. It was quite helpful to have! We continued along Paradise Road and parked at a pull-out near the Cougar Rock Campground parking lot. We started our hike at 3:45 pm. At that spot there is a pedestrian crossing and a sign that specifies distances to places of interest (Carter Falls, Paradise River Camp, Narada Falls, etc.). We followed the sign to the left (east) and then dipped into the Nisqually River gorge to cross the log footbridge over the river. The first payoff was a view of Tahoma looming over the Nisqually’s gorge. The day was cloudless but moderately hazy (my only complaint, because mountain views were not ideal). The trail then took us gently upwards over 1.3 miles (based on GPS, though the National Park Service lists the mileage as 1.1 miles) to Carter Falls. The trail follows the course of the Paradise River, which is an ever-present murmur along the trail. At 0.7 miles from the trailhead, there is a large erratic sitting in the middle of the stream, and this is a relatively safe spot to dip your toes in the water (some of our party did that). The trail becomes somewhat steeper, gaining steadily up to an altitude of 3650 feet over the last half-mile. The river's murmur grew to a roar, indicating our arrival at the falls after slightly less than an hour of ascent. We soaked in the views and then descended back to the trailhead and parking area, to complete a 95-minute round trip with 660 feet of elevation gain over 2.6 miles. Red and blue huckleberries were ripe, though nearly all of the berries have been consumed by hiking hordes. Pearly everlasting and foamflower are in bloom. The trail was not too crowded and in easily walkable condition. We met a few other hikers, along the way, including a group of three spending 7-8 days backpacking the Wonderland Trail.

Mildred Point	Amfredericks	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were terrible	Snow free	Got to the trailhead at 8:30am, still parking spots available in the main Comet Falls trailhead lot.  Beautiful day for a hike! Went to Comet Falls, then on to Van Trump Park. Lots of wildflowers and greenery all of the way up. Decided to tackle Mildred Point and was glad we did! It is super steep, be prepared to get dirty that last .5 miles. But WELL worth it. Bugs (mainly the flies) were HORRIBLE. I never use deet but if it would have kept them away, I would have used it. It was hot, and the hike is steep. Should have packed even more water than we did. Pack sunscreen, a lot of the trail is in the sun. Amazing day!!! 	Aug 08, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-09.2480386636
Silver Falls Loop	Stacy Lynn	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Boy howdy!  Nothing like choosing the hottest day of the year to hike, but it was so worth it upon reaching the falls and enjoying Laughing Water Creek afterward.  Life is good! A friend and our gaggle of kiddos (4 total today, ages 6-10) started this hike on the amphitheater side.  The trail was super dusty and those stairs were made for Big Foot, but we managed and appreciated the down times even more.  The trail was super easy to follow, the tail end of wild flowers to be hunted, a couple of friendly butterflies, the falls were nearly supernatural, the creek was cold, clear, and a sight to see, and the hot springs area was peaceful.  Only a few bug bites and those happened at the creek. Note:  the air quality was hazy and slightly smokey from the fires at Clear Lake area, on the east side of our beautiful state.  Definitely a keeper and one that we will try again, but on a cooler, less humid day.  Maybe in the fall?

Mount Pilchuck	hayleefaye	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	Hiked up to the lookout for sunrise. Pulled into the parking lot at 12:30am to find several other cars with the same idea. Caught a few hours of sleep before heading off on the trail between 3:30-4am. With just a headlamp, the trail is quite straightforward, very rocky in general but not hard to find. We summitted just as the sun was rising at 5:45 and joined the 10+ other people at the lookout for sunrise, several had camped in the lookout the night before. Made coffee, ate snacks, enjoyed the gorgeous sunrise views (although they were definitely inhibited by the smoke around here, but that's August for you). Headed down at 7:20 and off the mountain by 9:20.  Definitely recommend going on a weekday. I couldn't believe how many people were up there at 5am on a Wednesday, so I'm guessing the weekend crowds are insane.  Bugs were annoying at the summit when you stopped moving. Bug spray helped but I got bit several times.  Trail is very rocky, more so than other trails. Bring sturdy shoes or be prepared to watch out for a rolled ankle.  Gorgeous hike with amazing views! #watrailsday	Aug 08, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-08.4196188964
Redmond Watershed Preserve	karnage	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	took the kids out for a little hike today.

The trail is is clear and in great shape, we only saw two other people while we were out today. The huckleberries are done at this point, but it was an enjoyable little hike anyway.

Mount St. Helens - Monitor Ridge	UsuallyLurking	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	We got to Climber's Bivuoac the night before and got to bed early for an early start. We ended up hitting the trail around 5:45 am and I'd suggest hitting it that early or even a little bit earlier. During most of the hike up we were shaded by the ridge which combined with a breeze kept us cool. The real hard part was the last 1/3 of the way up with exposed large rocks to scramble over, and lots of ash at the end. Nothing was technically hard but it was a long slog.  No views due to fires but you could see in to the crater which was cool and made it worth it!  The way down was much harder than the way up. Not only were we tired but the sun was high enough now that it was warmer and there was no shade until we got back in to the trees.  I didn't wear gloves or gaiters and thought they were unnecessary, but my mom wore gloves and really liked them. No rangers checking out permits that day, but our car broke down at the trial head so we ended up hanging out around there all the next day waiting for a tow. Three rangers showed up then and we chatted with them a bit - they said they'd be checking permits at least 4 days a week, and we saw them writing up a ticket for a woman who'd left her permit at home. So make sure you bring the printed out permit with you! The rangers were also super helpful in getting a tow for our car, thank you rangers!

Skagit River	ToddlerTrekking	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	A great wander in the shade of the forest, we hiked this on a sweltering 90+ degree day while camping at Newhalem. It is a great trail for the kiddos, just watch any wild little ones near some of the river access points. If you do the loop starting from the campground, it is pretty much flat. If you go to the Visitor Center, you will have a descent sized hill to hike up. Its not hard but in the heat it was not our favorite part. After the trail, stop in the air conditioned visitor center to become a junior ranger and climb on the giant slug!

Mount St. Helens - Monitor Ridge	jennabailey54	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Got to the trail head at 845 and got to the top by about 12. The sign posts on the trail are incredibly helpful so trail finding was not an issue.  The first part part of the hike in the woods is very pleasant. I found the next section of about two mile of climbing boulders to be the most challenging. After that the last leg of the trail is very steep and feels like hiking In sand. I would recommend trekking poles for this portion.  It it was a very hot day 90s. I was in hiking pants and a tank top and felt that was perfect. There was a nice breeze the whole way up and I did not get cold at the top. The rest of my group wore shorts and were equally comfortable, so I think it’s just personal preference I prefer pants for protection from rocks, bugs and sun.  The rocks get hotter as the day goes on so keep that in mind when timing your hike. Bring more water than you think you need!   Unfortunately it was very hazy due to the forest fires, but the view inside the volcano was incredible, and the whole landscape felt like the land before time, very cool.  	Aug 08, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-13.1327669340
Skagit River	Freckledsunshine	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Set out on a hike with toddlers. Time to get those hike a thon miles in. The trailhead refers to this trail as the riverside loop trail. You can take the loop in either direction. We turned to the right and headed into the woods  the trail quickly became a forest full of ferns and moss and lots of shade. Found a good spot for the kids to enjoy the water, do be careful the river is deep and wide and fast. We opted not for the sand barge spots in the begining but found a safer spot further down. Kids enjoyed observing and holding an inchworm and then we turned a corner and saw where a fire had hit the area. It was eerie to see and the kids were full of questions. This stretch was very hot not shady and not as fascinating as the lush green section. We ended our hike at the visitor center where the kids got the answers to the million questions.  Help support wta hike a thon give.wta.org/Maggielou	Aug 08, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-10.4746277492
Palouse to Cascades Trail - The Tunnel	tdoyley	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	We set off to "beat the heat " and find the light at the end of the tunnel.  The coolness of the darkness was much welcomed to our group. We didn't even need long sleeves! But a light is a necessity for this hike. We saw several bicyclists and a few other hikers. The tunnel itself offers some imagination of a time long ago and what it must of been like for the men who built it.  The glory days of people traveling up to the mountains during the winter on a train .  Now we walk and bicycle what was once a busy track for a several ton engine.   There are 4 tables after you have exited the westside of tunnel and a clean outhouse .  The views are nice and you can go further on John Wayne Pioneer trail to explore  before turning around.  We clocked 6 miles and enjoyed the day.

The trail is short and well worn. Clearly heavily loved when the road reached this far. The water was warm. The Deer Creek Road is washed out and it is another 2 miles past the washout to the trail head. There were plentiful berries. The skies a bit hazy. There are good campsites directly on the lake.

Melakwa Lake	vashonjg	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	This was a great hike. I got an early start, 7AM, so I was in the shade most of the way up. It was plenty hot on the way down. Some bugs but my picaridin spray worked very well. The lakes were beautiful. Major disappointment. Some IDIOT had built a fire in a stone ring right by upper Melakwa lake. It seemed out and may have been there for weeks but I poured water on it just in case. Why someone would do this in a area marked no campfires when there have been so many wildfires is beyond me. Please be careful.

Yellow Lake	EmilB	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	At 2 PM on a sunny Wednesday, we found ample parking at the pool off of 244th.  See the additional link for a trail map. Pluses: - Wildlife: We saw a diverse armada of waterfowl around the dock; a bunny with a mouthful of nesting moss; downy and pileated woodpeckers  ; a Douglas squirrel.  This is the most wildlife I've seen on a short walk south of Canada. - Trees: The lake is ringed by impressive second growth; some big trunks really dazzle.  We also saw notable collections of cedar and fir. Minuses: - If you are looking for a place to walk your dog off-leash with water access, this isn't the place.  There is a lot of traffic, you are hemmed in by houses along some stretches, despite the lake there is no water access (the dock is fully-fenced), and it is a wildlife protection area. - It is definitely a woodland walk in a neighborhood (although admittedly an impressive one).  You will not mistake this for a wilderness experience.

The Enchantments	tiffanyc	Obstacles on trail:	    Trees down across trail,	    Difficult stream crossing(s),	    Muddy or wet trail,	I'll give a quick summary of each day here, with more details in separate trip reports.    Got to the Stuart/Colchuck trailhead to a full parking lot around 7:00 on a Wednesday morning. Trail up to Colchuck Lake was straightforward, but gets rocky after the junction fork to Stuart. Took about 3 hours with our packs.  Climb to Aasgard was really hard with our backpacking packs. Starts out with larger boulders to maneuver over, then becomes steep dirt and rock scree. Views of Colchuck are amazing. Lots of mosquitoes.  Set up camp near Isolation & Tranquil Lakes, where there are lots of mountain goats and views of surrounding peaks.  Woke up early to catch the sunrise at Little Annapurna. "Official" trail is difficult to follow with occasional cairns -- basically a rock scramble to the top. Views are phenomenal. Tons of mosquitoes.  Inspiration, Perfection, and Sprite Lakes are beautiful. All of them would be great to camp around, but we continued to Leprechaun. T Woke up early to catch the sunrise at Prusik Pass. Again, "official" trail is hard to stay on with very few cairns, and also a rock scramble. Many mosquitoes. Sunrise was nice, but it was better at Gnome Tarn. Beautiful views of Prusik Peak.  Moved camp to Lake Viviane, which was a popular camping/lunch place. Took a side trip to Temple Lake, requiring a small hike up the knoll between Viviane and Temple. Quiet lake to wade in and hammock around.  Woke up because the wind was insane and blowing our tent away. Moved camp to Lower Snow Lake, passing Upper Snow Lake. Upper has a lot of beach area to camp on, but if it's windy, it's probably not the best idea. Some iffy rock scrambles on the way down to Snow Lakes, especially for people with packs.  Hiked past Nada Lake, which was occasionally a rock scramble, but a lot of it is dirt trail under tree cover. Super long 6 or 7 miles back to the Snow Zone trailhead. Not too many super steep parts in my opinion, but definitely a slog given how long it is, especially with all of those switchbacks near the trailhead. 	Aug 08, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-12.4237627852
Eldorado Peak	madelynnscherrer	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Trail snow-covered at times - gear and expertise recommended	My friend Erin, and I went for a two-day approach of Eldorado peak, and we got lucky with nice weather and good trail conditions! First off, the real route-finding crux of the approach really is within the first hundred feet of the road with log crossings over the Cascade River. While there are cairns roughly marking the logs to cross, I would suggest referring to buritoburito's trip report on May 27, 2018. They have pictures and descriptions which made it so that we didn't even have to search very hard - so thank you buritoburito! Once you cross these logs, and you find the trailhead sign, the path is pretty straightforward, albeit STEEP until the boulderfeilds. Once you are at the boulderfields, the "path" isn't too straightforward, and there are cairns speckled throughout the fields. Here, there isn't really a "right" way up, you'll get to the right spot no matter which cairns you follow! We found it nicer to follow the cairn trail to the climbers right of the fields however, as this "trail" would occasionally become a dirt path every once in a while - which we appreciated! As for , the first one we encountered this time of year was a waterfall at apx. 5,000 ft. which was just at the top of the boulderfields (see pic below) but after this, there was plenty of water on the rest of the approach. Getting across the ridge was pretty straightforward, with now snow this time of year, and well marked with cairns. It was at about 6,000ft. Once you are over the ridge, the "trail" is again pretty nondescript, but if you stick to the climbers right side of the area, and follow the cairns that are there, you'll be in good shape for the glacier portion. My climbing partner and I ended up camping at 6,400ft. due to it being late in the day, however this seemed to work well for us, as this put us just below the glacier with lots of water sources. The only difficulty was finding a flat spot, but after some searching we found a decent spot and slept well.  We decided that for this climb we didn't need a super early alpine start, so we got up at 4:30am and started walking just as dawn was breaking. We stuck to climbers right of the glacier, and the route was really straightforward and smooth. Nothing really notable until the ridge, where we chose to stay on snow as long as we could, and had to cross onto the rocks just below an opening crevasse. There are plenty of places to cross over. The ridge was very stable and felt very secure for both the ascent and descent. (See pic below). We brought pickets for protection, and used them mostly for peace of mind on the ridge, but really not incredibly necessary. No notable crevasse crossings either (only two little slivers before high camp).  Overall a great day in the mountains, which left us sore, tired, happy, and in awe that we live in such a beautiful state!  (Side note: I did download a GPS route from summitpost (see link below) and this was accurate and reassuring when we needed it!)

Pinnacle Peak	Birdman	Obstacles on trail:	    .	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Obtained a cross country permit for an overnight in the Zone east of Pinnacle Peak. Trail in great shape to the end of the maintained section. Headed east toward Pinnacle Pk and The Castle. Tried to get around Castle but may have been on the wrong route as I ran into some very steep scrambling so headed back toward Pinnacle. Saw a boot track on the east of Pinnacle and decided to explore. It leads to, for me, a very precarious boot track down a slot to a small tarn which looked like a super spot to spend the night. Warm, sunny, gentle breeze, and total solitude to enjoy some wonderful views including the night sky and some falling stars. Note: take your time on the boot track!

Tolmie Peak Lookout - Eunice Lake	TiffanyBerry	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were terrible	Snow free	Did this with my 8yo and 3yo (who is still carried a fair amount) on a hot day with so very many bugs.  The bugs weren't biting a lot, but they were thick.   Don't let the "gradual elevation" fool you - parts of this are a climb, or if you're 3yo, a scramble.  We opted not to do the additional route to the lookout (see the "carried 3yo" part), but it was nice to make it to the lake, even if our stop was cut short by mosquitoes.  The fire lookout is impressive looking even from the lake.  If you come, bring plenty of water, but there is a fair amount of shade along the way (for Rainier), which is nice.  There are drop-offs to one side, so if you are bringing kids that don't honor that danger, be aware of the potential problems. Berries weren't ripe yet - neither thimbleberry or huckleberry - but perhaps in another two or three weeks.	Aug 08, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-08.3000267796
Iron Goat Trail	Muledeer	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	If you are interested in railroad history, this is the trail. I took my brother on this hike for hikeathon, it seemed a good choice on a hot day. We started from the Red Caboose  (Interpretive Center) and hiked to Wellington. First, I recommend doing those switchbacks on the Windy Point crossover trail early. When you get to the top, before you start towards Wellington, detour to the path leading to the tunnel end on the left. The air is cool coming out of the tunnel with a nice breeze. Along the trail to Wellington, the waterfalls that come off the snowshed walls were pretty much gone, only one small one was flowing. The vegetation is high and there are a few stickery plants. There is some trail in forest, but much of the trail is exposed and today it was hot. The snowsheds that you can walk thru were a welcome blast of cool air. When you get to the old townsite follow the trail past the parking lot that leads to the end of the tunnel that went under the mtn pass. There used to be a trail to it, but after flooding and washouts it is deemed unsafe to enter. This was a great hike for history, but I think the overall hike is much better in late spring, clearer views and blooming trillium.  Nice in the fall  on a cloudy day for some mushroom photography also. 	Aug 08, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-08.7352710751
Sharpe Park - Sares Head	Quantum Guru	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	This was another hike in our explorations of trails in the Anacortes area. My hiking buddy Marin and I both are relative newcomers to the area. Today we made our first visit to Sharpe Park. It helped to download a trail map from   https://www.skagitcounty.net/ParksAndRecreation/Documents/misc/Parks/Trail_Map_handout2.pdf Paper copies of the map were available at the trailhead today, but might not always be found there. A vintage signboard near the trailhead shows an out-of-date trail map that has fewer trails and older trail names -- it's not helpful at all. Fortunately, signs along the trails agree with the new map. We set out on the signed Sares Head Trail and soon approached Fox Pond. Much of the pond is choked with cattails. A short spur trail to the right (Calypso Trail) did not offer much in the way of views. We could see more of the pond from farther along on the Sares Head Trail (A bit of open water, some lily pads and a few yellow lily flowers. No ducks were visible today.) We passed junctions with the Porpoise Point and Shelley Loop Trails and continued on. We did the same at junctions with the Sunburst Trail and the other end of the Shelley Loop Trail. We soon arrived at the open, rocky headland of the Sares Head Overlook, 0.77 miles from the trailhead. It has a convenient bench that we had all to ourselves. The views there are incredible, although more distant views - to the Olympics for example -were somewhat obscured by smoke from regional forest fires. Closer to shore we could see fishing boats, likely Native American, setting out nets. We continued on the Broom-Tomb loop Trail, an 0.56-mile loop that drops, then regains, some 170 feet of elevation. Parts of this trail seemed rather steep and minimal, although the route was never in doubt. Part way around it comes to the Machin Overlook, another viewpoint with a convenient bench (We also had this one to ourselves.) We noted, down on the water, additional fishing boats setting out nets, and also a small flotilla of kayakers near Northwest Island. We continued on the Broom-Tomb Loop Trail. (It resumes a few feet to the front and right of the bench. Do not confuse it with a prominent social trail that disappears into the woods to the rear of the bench, leads past a white chair, and may head toward a residence just outside the park.) We soon rejoined our incoming Sares Head Trail and followed it back to our trailhead. We hope to explore other park trails that lead to the Montgomery-Durban Headlands on another park visit. Except for a few birds we saw no wildlife today. Most of the wildflower season has past, although we did note a few late-blooming avens, buttercups, and foam flowers in the forest area, plus some pearly everlasting in very sunny areas.

Suntop Lookout	CiscoKitty	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	Decided to stop here on my way home from camping near Rainier. I wanted a short hike since the last 2 were longer and the heat takes a toll on you.  Drove the "rough in areas" forest road to the locked gate. I had no idea if it would be open. I had told myself I was going to drive to the top and not hike but I was forced to hike from the gate, .6 miles, and in the long run I am grateful for that.  The lookout was unlocked so I got to go inside and peak around. Signed the log book and enjoyed a shade break. I ended up wandering all around the top. The view are stunning but with the wildfire smoke it was hazy. It was incredible to see the dark band on the horizon knowing that it was smoke! The view of Rainier here is stunning. Had it not been hazy from smoke it is possible to see Adams and St Helens. Next time hopefully. 	Aug 07, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-11.6837280296
Paradise	Jennekehikes	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	Decided to wander around Paradise at sunset to catch the evening colors and wildflowers. Thankfully much of the crowds had already dispersed, and we had much of the trail to ourselves. We made a quick loop from the Paradise Inn, clockwise on Skyline to the Avalanche Lily Trail, back along Waterfall Trail to hit Skyline again and end at Myrtle Falls as the sun was going down. Wildflowers are out, but not as stunning a display as I have seen in previous years. Lupine seem to be finished in the lower elevations, some Indian Paintbrush are out, Asters are starting to bloom and look like will be popping very soon. We had word of a bear on trail above Myrtle Falls but did not see it. FYI: A portion of Alta Vista is currently closed for repair (see picture below)	Aug 07, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-10.8634655412
Narada Falls to Reflection Lakes	audg86	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Lots of people on the short trail to Narada Falls, and even more at Reflection Lakes, but just a handful of people on the trail between the two. Made for a nice chance to get away from the crowds.	Aug 07, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-09.3201289624

Lake Dorothy - Lake Bear - Lake Deer	HeatherJasper	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	The 9 miles of dirt road is a bit rough in spots but I didn't have any trouble driving it in a Prius. My car has very low clearance but I didn't have any problem with the potholes or rocks on the road. The trail has clearly been worked on recently and is in great shape. If you have short legs or are hiking with children be prepared for the steps on the trail to feel like very big stairs. The bridge is beautiful and the stream has the most perfect swimming hole immediately downstream of the bridge. Closer to Lake Dorothy there are lots of huckleberries right along the trail. We didn't have any trouble with mosquitoes but there were some biting flies at the lake. This didn't stop us from getting in the water. It's perfectly clear and just the right temperature. We didn't go past Lake Dorothy or spend the night, but I appreciated the map of the lake and campsites that is posted by the trail junction where you can choose to go to the outlet or inlet spurs or to continue on hiking.

Granite Creek Trail to Granite Lakes	KimN	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Husband and I did this hike with our bad to the bone 7 year old. You park at the end of the road at a small parking lot. We got there at 9am and it was already half full on a weekday. Nice bathrooms at the parking lot. We choose to ride bikes on the Carbon River road to the campground where you find the trailhead to the Carbon Glacier. The road for bike riding is good, with a slight incline which you feel if you can't shift (little kid bike). Had to walk the bikes through a few rough areas of washout where it was very rocky or had deep sand. Tons of old growth trees. Took us an hour to get to the trailhead. At the campground there are bike racks to lock up bikes.  The hike had very little bugs, we did see bear scat and bear prints so prepare with bear spray. The trail had very little people. Just wanted to add more detail to the detour. The detour has you cross a log bridge on the Carbon River. From there you still need to navigate over two 6ft wide off springs from the river by crossing by foot over the big rocks. Look for the stacks/pile of rocks to help navigate the trail. We were glad to have hiking poles to help with the crossing of the river. Once out of the rocky river bed (keep following the stacks of rocks) you head east, then go up some switch backs. At the top of the switchbacks you head south again towards the glacier.  The suspension bridge is a lot of fun, and the view of the glacier is pretty cool.  The hikes elevation gain was easy and mostly steady. The best part was bike riding back, barely had to pedal. 	Aug 07, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-08.8999542533
Lake Ann (Mount Baker Highway)	Merritt	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Intermittent snow - not hard to cross	Video attached. I Arrived at the TH about 9:30am. Lots of parking. No privy at the TH, so if you are wanting to avoid unpleasantness on the hike, go just around the corner to Artist Point to do so. This is one of those rare hikes that is...."Uphill, both ways".  I quickly descended into the valley. The first mile or so is through forest, so shade was appreciated. Blueberries the entire route, but still perhaps a week or 2 off before being ripe. I found 3 bushes near Swift Creek that were ripe. After Swift Creek, it was all uphill, and all in direct sun. Gain was steady but not hard. The remainder of the route is through Talus and rock, so you spend quite a bit of time looking down at your footing. If you remember to check, the views of Mt. Baker are awesome from here. Lots of little streams, so at no point is obtaining water an issue. One teeny snow crossing at the saddle, and suddenly you are there - Lake Ann. Be warned - Lake Ann, although the name of the hike, is NOT the crown jewel of the trip - Mount Shuksan is simply breathtaking from here. Lots of campsites around the lake. I picked a spot near the outlet of the lake, for ease of water supply. I spent the remainder of the day staring at Shuksan, and then a bit of the night staring at the galaxy. What an incredible spot! There were 4 tents overnight, but I really only saw 4 people walking around while I was there. Still felt very isolated, which was the goal.

Bellevue Botanical Garden	pstanton	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Well maintained urban park. It is large enough that if you get further back along the trails you get the illusion of being truly in some wilderness. The garden has something for everyone: you can wander among the flowers, a Japanese garden, or go back into some untouched wilderness that includes a suspension bridge over a ravine.  I was comfortable walking the entire park in just flip-flops, as the paths are mostly well-maintained crushed gravel. Be aware that water fountains are limited to the central area, so you might want to carry some water with you on a hot day. There are plenty of benches scattered around for those in need of a rest, and there were plenty of seniors and young children about.

Noble Knob	lathrop fam	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	This hike was difficult to find, but like the last trip report said you CAN find it using wta directions. The details are left out and we made a few lucky guesses.  We came in from 410 and off fsrd 70 to 72. Fsrd 72 was 5.8miles in on rd 70 once you leave 410. We zipped right past it the first time bc wta said 7.2miles in and after arriving at green water lakes trail area realized we must have gone too far. We did and had missed the small sign on the left side of the road: fsrd 70.  Once on rd 72 and fsrd 7250 there are several intersections. Proceed straight through them all including the path with two gates (go through the yellow one here). At the T in the road, we guessed and got lucky, took the road to the left going up hill. This road eventually dead ends at the trailhead.  Once on the trail it was a little creepy going through the burned section. There are a few other trail you cross. The ranger creek trail joins in, then at a crossroads with coral pass the sign simply says rd 72-go up hill to the right on this. Once you’re up at the ridge line and the trail T’s go left. There is a bit of a scramble over rocks of down a steep path for 100ft here. Use caution but just continue on and the trail resumes. You can see several lakes as you round up to noble knob through the beautiful alpine meadow.  Once you’re on top it was worth all the crazy navigating! Simply stunning!

Railroad Grade	dchk	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Road 12 still cratered especially at start. I am beginning to believe this is the forest service's passive aggressive way to deter crowds or get funding as this part of the road has had this problem for several seasons now. Road 13 much better, but does have some craters as well. This hike is in excellent condition. Today the dust was so dry that I found the footing a little slippery midday as temperatures rose. Smoke to south and east visible in distance but visibility locally very good, even down to Twin Sisters Range. My hike continued from the vicinity of the upper night camp location as a cross country visit of Deming Glacier Icefall. The canyon and icefall of this glacier may be the most awe-inspiring site on Baker.	Aug 07, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-07.0155962402
Anderson and Watson Lakes	Alideats	Obstacles on trail:	    .	Road rough but passable	Bugs were terrible	Weekend Family Backpacking Trip to Watson Lake! The road is rough. We were in a pickup truck so we made it in ok. I would NOT take my Camry on this road! We headed out Friday afternoon in the mist. Trail was in good shape. My 9 year old had no problem carrying his 13lb. pack and navigating the trail. Hiked all the way into upper Watson Lake. Found a spot on the lake & set up camp. The bugs are terrible - constant from the am to the night. Lot's of mosquitos, annoying flys & super annoying gnats!

Snow Lake	granitemountain	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Did a weekday overnighter and for the second year in a row for weekday, was the only person there.    Already lots of info on this hike, but I will add a few personal inputs.  Many people hike down to the lake and stop at the first lake access and consider that the end.   Everything gets better as you continue and it is under two miles to Gem Lake.  You don't need to go all the way there to enjoy all this but it is a great destination.  The trail continues up the lake and the views get better and better.   After a bit, you ascend a ridge and the trail alternates between lakeside and dropping over with grande views of the Middle Fork Valley, the PCT area N. of the Katwalk, and eventually Snoqualmie Mountain towering overhead.  When it drops back lake side the views of Snow lake are great.  Eventually it reaches Gem Lake which is a worthy destination. Returned via Source Lake by following the spur trail upon ascending the lake basin at the next to last switchback prior to the big viewing rock at the ridge.  A longer trail but more gradual.  Do not attempt this earlier in the summer when the snow bridge at the source lake end is a snow cave you have to cross over.

Margaret Lake	RMiller	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Hiked on Saturday to Margaret Lake in the morning before Seafair events started.  Left Seattle at 7:00 and started hiking at 8:15.  Made it to the Lake at 9:30 and back to Seattle by noon (before I-90 closed for the Blue Angels).  Didn't notice flies or mosquitoes on the trail, just beautiful mist from the morning marine layer coming through the first rays of the sun.  The trail is in good shape and made for fast walking.  The trail down to the lake from the ridge was the only section where I was more careful with my footing.  The first mosquitoes showed up when we reached the lake shore.  Some prime campsites were available for overnighters.  On our way out we passed about 20 people starting to hike and the parking lot was full.  Overall really good hike.

Tolmie Peak Lookout - Eunice Lake	nitalong	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	Weekday hike to Tolmie lookout- parked at Mowich Lake to start our ascent and stopped at Eunice lake along the way for lunch and a dip in the water. We encountered 4-5 other groups of people hiking the same trail and about 20 people at the lookout. Popular place to sit and admire Rainier while grabbing a bite. That last mile up to the lookout was the most challenging but definitely worth it. This is a solid intermediate hike and will be back again before the end of summer.

Spray Park	TiffanyBerry	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	Like most things at Rainier, even the easy trails can be an effort if you're not in great shape.  This isn't a hard hike, but it has up and down and up again, so keep that in mind if you have anything that might make that harder.  But we made it. Signs are fairly clear, so don't worry about missing your destination.  It's worth noting that, unless you're prepared for a rock scramble, you'll only see part of the falls from the location referenced on trail, but it's beautiful there nonetheless. There were berries ripening on the trail, and a few sections already ripe.  Give it a few more days and there will be a bounty!

Snoqualmie Lake	leachmal	Obstacles on trail:	    .	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Went up here for an overnighter on a week night and had the lake to myself! I took the Middle Fork road and hiked the extra half mile from the parking lot to the trailhead. Overall the hike was pretty easy, just long and with a few spots where the trail had been washed out or covered in river rocks. Took a bit of maneuvering but for the average hiker it is definitely doable! The last two miles of the hike are the most difficult, here you’ll find switchbacks and places where most of the trail is covered in rocks. At one point the trail is so washed out by rocks, you can’t see the other end! However, some kind soul put up some rock stacks to guide your way so follow those and you’ll be fine. This hike was beautiful and well worth the hours it took to get to the lake! Would do again, especially for the peace I found at the lake.

Mount Ellinor	BikerHikerSeattle	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Starting from the lower parking lot made this hike a good challenge, although at almost 90 °C it became increasingly difficult, especially during the second half, where there is virtually no shade. Also, the smoke from wild fires in Eastern Washington made its way all the way over here and caused a hazy horizon, so we did not have the view we were hoping for. However, the wild flower and various critters on the summit made this hike a memorable experience nonetheless.

Mount Catherine	nuntheless	Minor obstacles posing few problems	Road recommended for high clearance only	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	Long drive in, short hike. But so worth it. The road was beastly. Yes, many deep potholes, and then a couple of places where the road was washed out and we had the Subaru bite through the jagged rocks. We had a baby with us and she thought the world was ending.  The trail is well marked by the roadside, #1348, with a tidy and inviting gravel entry way to this mostly well maintained trail. It was a hot morning and we were really glad that the trail is mostly shaded. A cool breeze was so encouraging. We followed well worn footpaths to fabulous views of mountains that we know from other perspectives. To the north, Red Mountain, like a sore thumb, is the destination of the Commonwealth Basin hike. Guye Peak, a great scramble. Kendall Peaks, the famous catwalk. Granite Mountain across to the west, Humpback Mountain where my hiking buddy proposed marriage to his wife---his baby was along with us to make her first summit at the age of 9months.  This is a steep trail, but it intermittenly levels off giving some relief to the climbing. The last bit to the summit was a little bit scrambly. My friend took the more step-like approach to the right of the track you first come across. He's a mountaineer, but the papoose makes a person pick the most judicious track up. It seems that folks are trying to work out for themselves a good path to the summit. Right away when we reached the summit we thought the impressive far off massif must be Mount Stuart, judging from the shape. We whipped out the biggest map we had, and took compass readings. But the map only showed us as far as Mt Hinman, and we couldn't quite decide on that. Now, looking at the photo that goes with the trail description, we realize that our first guess was the best guess. Watch out for persistent, stinging flies. They just kept at us, stinging to no end. Meanwhile after a diaper change, a bottle of milk (mom had to work), and some huckleberries for dessert, the baby wanted to get going. So, off we went, casting a last sweeping look at the panorama of mountains around and blue water below. We turned around and made our way down, feeling our toes coming to the front of our boots in the steep downhill. It was such a short hike down, amazing. Equally amazing was the sight of sedan cars in the parking area. What warriors. So, just goes to show, if you know your car and you're careful---or maybe you carry plywood like a recent trip reported thought---you can overcome any obstacle. Happy Hiking!

Colchuck Lake	isabellewallace_	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Got to the parking lot around 7am on a Tuesday. Almost full because of overnighters, but overflow parking available. Make sure you have a recreation pass or pay the $5 day fee at the trailhead down the road. You'll also need another permit for the area which can be filled out at the trailhead, and take it with you. Trail has minimal elevation until about a mile and a half in. The uphill is a challenge but doable. The trail can be trecherous but is easy to follow. You'll start getting some views 3/4 of the way up. The lake is beautiful and we encountered a family of goats. Took 2 hours 15 to get to the top and 1 hour 45 minutes down. On the way down it started feeling really hot and we were glad we left so early. Keep the forecast in mind... hiking in the afternoon would have been quite unpleasant. Great day hike if you are in the Leavenworth area!

Mailbox Peak	paulspackin	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were terrible	Snow free	Straightforward trail with a few sections where the foliage is encroaching on the trail, but most of the trail is nice and wide.  The rock field near the top was one of the easiest I've ever had to navigate.  There's a definite color difference in the rock that makes it easy to follow.  Until the trail joins the old trail near the top, I found the grade pretty easy, but the grade continues to increase all the way until you get to the top.   Didn't see any bugs until about 1500' into the ascent, and they weren't bad until the peak.  There are huge swarms around the mailbox.  I didn't look closely, but looked like someone had left some nuts in the box, so maybe that was part of the reason?  They did seem particularly bad around the mailbox itself.   My GPS clocked 3925' of ascent, and 10.75 miles round trip.

Bob Heirman Wildlife Preserve	ninjaracerchick	Obstacles on trail:	    Trees down across trail,	    Overgrown in places.	Road suitable for all vehicles	Have always loved this preserve. It has gotten severely overgrown after the first walk thru the valley. Saw some eagles among other birds, and also saw a few piles of bear scat. It’s definitely possible to get to the good beachy areas, but you have to be prepared to fight with blackberries most of the way.

Winchester Mountain	the noisy diobsuds	Obstacles on trail:	    Trees down across trail.	Road recommended for high clearance only	Bugs were not too bad	Two trees have fallen across the trail.  Folks carrying babies/small children in backpacks will have to take them out to negotiate the second downed tree.

Westcrest Park	Elizabeth “Ducky”	Obstacles on trail:	    Trees down across trail,	    Overgrown in places.	Road suitable for all vehicles	Decided to head back to a park with a Seattle skyline view that was close to home.  Being in White Center this park does not feel like it. Hiked the west dawamish trail from the south parking lot to the norther part of the park.  Every spur of this trail heading west leads you to the huge off leash dog park while spurs to the east lead you do residential streets.  Only saw a few dog walkers heading to the dog park on the trail.  Being so close to the city it didn’t feel like it at all. You can’t see any homes or streets from the trails and there’s no noise pollution aside from the planes flying out of SeaTac. And the occasional train horn   The wind was perfect to add a nice summer breeze to this hike.  There are some areas where it’s a little over grown and blackberries are starting to close in on the trail. Small maple trees are growing near some spots of the trail as well.  I encountered two down trees that were small enough to step over. There are some roots and rocks in the middle of the trail so if you’re looking around like I did they can be trip hazards. Dusty dry trail let’s everyone you pass know you tripped.  Sadly one area near the south parking lot smelled like weed. But other parts of the trail you could smell ripe blackberries.  On the west side of this park is a cute little pea patch and a good sized play area along with big open fields.  Just before you get to the play area you can see the beautiful Seattle skyline and if it’s clear Mt Baker to the north. (Not Clear enough for a decent photo though).	Aug 07, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-07.3260929890
Chain Lakes Loop	susanjmunn	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Intermittent snow - not hard to cross	Hiked this on Saturday. We started really late, arrived at the Artist Point parking lot around 2:30 pm.  Hundreds of people were there. There was some sort of car club meet up going on, lots of dogs, lots of families. It's great how accessible this beautiful place can be, but that comes with the price of being in nature with mobs of people. We were feeling lazy so we hiked from Artist point to see Mazama Lake, Iceberg Lake, and Hayes Lake. There were a lot of people camping and swimming at Mazama Lake. I also saw a lot of families backpacking and camping.  The trail still has some slippery snow on it about a mile from the parking lot. It was making some other hikers very nervous. We passed over the snow just fine in hiking boots, but if you're nervous bring some poles to help you balance.  The trail is also very exposed, with very little shade, so bring some sunscreen and water.  This place was full of dogs, many were off leash.  Wildflowers are out, but I didn't notice any blueberries yet.  Bugs weren't too bad. 	Aug 07, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-07.2137659658
Pinnacle Saddle	seattlenativemike	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	One of my favorite hikes around the Paradise side of Rainier.  I left Seattle about 2pm to get through south King county before traffic and began scouting around the park for hikes to do for sunset.  If the sky looked interesting, I figured I would head up to Pinnacle.  It did so I did.  It takes about an hour to hike up to the Saddle area.  Great Rainier views along the way and tons of paintbrush and other flowers line the trail. I savored the views in the area and hiked back down by headlamp after sunset. Four photos below.  The last image is a drone shot taken from  , since drones aren't allowed in MRNP, the next morning.

Park Butte	Tall Tommy	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	After relying on WTA trip reports over the years, I felt compelled to contribute after a beautiful yet bizarre overnight to the Park Butte Lookout. We set off kid free at around 10 am, hoping to have a shot at sleeping in the Lookout. It was quite hot right away, but no bugs to speak of. Were happy to get over the creek and back into the trees to escape the sun. Of course we were constant eyeing the day hikers who overtook us, wanting to stay a step ahead of the backpackers. Lucky for us we were the first backpackers up. An hour later another nice couple showed up and we offered them the floor, as they seemed pretty bummed to miss out on the Lookout. Two other groups came and left to camp at Cathedral. The afternoon was quiet, with our new friends taking a nap and ourselves kicking back to read and watch the smoke from the Cougar Creek Fire. It was strange to consider how that was the original purpose of the structure - to watch for fires. The smoke changed rapidly and it made us very curious to hear what had changed when we got back. Around 4:00 things got weird. A group arrived hoping to use the Lookout with a very different demeanor. Some members of this group had jobs in social media, but were vague about exactly what. At any rate, the vibe was killed pretty quick as they pulled up chairs, pulled out their phones, and started watching youtube videos. One individual without service begged another to make his device a hotspot so that they could get online access as well. Definitely a mood killer. We had a nice reprieve when they left to set up camp about 50 feet below. and have dinner. It's not a designated site, but pretty clear that it is frequently used as such. We had a nice time chatting as we ate with our new friends, and the sun began to set just north of the Sisters range. I never knew that you could see Semiahmoo Spit from the Lookout! Now I want to use a telescope on the spit so I can try to spot the lookout on a clear day. I was contemplating this and enjoying the peace of the moment when Team Instagram returned. One member of the group struck up a pose on the railing and began compulsively tossing her hair as another snapped away. "Excuse me," the photographer asked, "would you mind sliding a foot down that way?" Irked as I was, I was too astonished to do anything but comply! Until the sun had set, they circled around us, moving things and posing for their perfect shots to post on Instagram. Total buzzkill. I went to asleep a little annoyed but was able to laugh it off. We woke up around 1:00 to watch some of the meteor shower. I know we were a few days early, but we still caught some. 20 minutes of stargazing was all we had in us, and we promptly fell back asleep. Just before 6:00 I awoke to a large banging noise. It seems that Team Instagram had come back to the Lookout and were moving the storm door of the Lookout around to get it out of their pre-sunrise photos. They had commented that on it's positioning the day before and I guess the pictures were better without it. I learned that when someone is walking around the outside of the lookout, you definitely hear it inside! In principal I was pretty furious. Really, how can you be so inconsiderate of others? Practically, I have to admit that I woke up just in time to catch the sunrise with my wife, from our bed. It was incredible. Making breakfast was a little tricky, because as I was trying to boil water Team Instagram was trying to boil water AND get the perfect photo of the process of boiling water. It made me wonder if they were taking pictures of specific sponsored products as part of their job. Far be it from me to interfere with commerce! We packed up shortly after breakfast and made it to the car around 10. Way more folks heading up for the Lookout on Wednesday. Some were going to get their before noon and still miss out. I will say that despite the strangeness of technology in this remote place, it could never detract from the beauty of this hike so much that I wouldn't love it. What an incredible place. I love being sandwiched between Baker and the Sisters, looking right down the Middle Fork of the Nooksack. On the hike we were discussing whether this kind of technological presence was the new normal, or just an anomaly of an experience. We heard some folks behind us having an animated conversation, really get into it the way people should as they walk together in the wild. We stepped aside to let them pass. Mouths closed and heads down, they were listening to a podcast. Cheers, Tommy P.S. Some Notes about the Lookout Structure - Got quite toasty at night! - No problem with mice, thanks all for keeping it clean. - We tried putting up all the storm shutters, but were missing quite a few nuts to go with their accompanying bolts. I almost lost one myself. We put up 4 of the remaining 6 (East stays open all summer), but we had to get creative. If anybody wants to hit up the hardware store before they go up again...

Grove of the Patriarchs Loop	Jennekehikes	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	Trailhead was busy this early Tuesday afternoon. Lots of people using the picnic tables and facilities, as well as heading onto the trail. Trail is in great shape, as were the suspension bridge and boardwalk. The ancient forest is an absolute treasure, and peppered with interpretive signs with information on the variety of massive trees present along the trail. There is also plenty of river access - perfect for dipping your feet on a hot day like today! 	Aug 07, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-10.0961652186

Explorer Falls	BKREBBS	Obstacles on trail:	    .	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Today me and my husband hiked this trail with our dog! Parking wasn’t too big. There’s enough space for 4-5 cars. However today we only saw one car when we arrived, that left soon after and one car that parked as we were coming back, so I’m assuming the small parking isn’t an issue. I’m glad I read these reviews before going because you have to go around the closed gate to enter! My mind says if there’s a gate do not enter haha but I guess this wasn’t the case with this hike. So then about .5 miles maybe down the gravel path there was a sign that led us to the trail. Overall it was nice. Sun was shining. Wasn’t too hot. Bugs were annoying but we didn’t get bit. We did come to another closed gate and again had to go around it! The waterfall was hard to find. We actually passed it and went about a half mile further. So we turned back. There’s a rocked form arrow on the ground next to the entrance of the waterfall “trail” I guess. We saw it the first time but didn’t understand how to get to the waterfall.  Figured out you have to go along the river on the rocks. We ended up actually crossing the river to another trail and going up the mountain to get to the top of the waterfall. If kids aren’t present would recommend! It’s a nice hike and cool to see over the waterfall but the path is very narrow and steep in some areas where you will slide if you don’t get your footing right. Got some scratches from sliding and climbing haha but overall was a great adventure!	Aug 07, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-09.5733190949

Beckler Peak	Nordique	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	Our carload of senior citizens returned to Beckler Peak today, one of our favorite hikes, on what turned out to be one very HOT day!  Luckily, we all brought plenty of fluids.  How hot?  Well, it was 90F when we got back down to the trailhead.  For me, that is way too hot!  The original forecast was for highs in the low 80's--and we aimed for an early start. Horse flies bugged us on the hike, going up and going down, big flies who even providing slight cooling as they tried to attack our arms, necks, etc.  So much for our bug juice! Summit views were, as always, terrific!  My photos may be found in the link below.	Aug 07, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-07.5650215720
Narada Falls	Jennekehikes	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Narada Falls is always work a quick stop, whether for the falls alone, or as part of a longer hike.

Fragrance Lake	AllOfUs	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Visiting the in-laws, so went out this morning for a quick hike. Chose Fragrance Lake because it was close to town (7 miles out of Bellingham) and looked like a good workout. The official WTA description is spot on. Trailhead is across from entrance to Larrabee State Park. Two miles to the lake, the first mile is relatively steep switchbacks. Constant uphill for sure. Second mile is easier. Loop around lake is 0.75 miles, lots of open spaces, some benches, lots of boardwalk bridges. If you can get young kids up the switchbacks, they could easily spent hours exploring around (and in) the lake. I was wearing my Keen sandals and a light pack, didn't seem to need poles or boots. I was in the trees the whole time, so this would be a good choice on a hot, sunny day. I started hiking at 6:30am, back to the car by 9:00am. Just under five miles total - a great hike! 	Aug 07, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-08.0332588633
Noble Knob	Kronst	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	:  5 of 5 stars!   :  This hike starting from “the Dalles Ridge Access” is very nice.  There are pretty wild flowers & yummy blueberries.   Although Mt Rainier was almost fully clouded or smoked over by the time we got there at 3 pm, this is still a great hike.  It would be perfect if we could have seen Mt Rainier clearly.  The hike is moderately easy.  However, the route I’m explaining below adds about 500 ft gain and another mile or so (our guesses).  I’m not sure if I’d recommend this hike for beginners, unless they are in good shape.  Also, this trail head could be hard to find for a beginner.     :  None.   :  Great.      :  Negligible.  However, we put on Neem bug spray and they did not bother us.   :  My friends & I are 60, 51, and 47 ish.  It took us 5.5 hours to do the hike, including lots of pictures, picking lot of blueberries, and resting.  We’re guessing the actual hiking was less than 4 hours.   :  Very nice mountain views!   We could see the outline of Mt Rainier which was covered by clouds or smoke.  Very nice wild flowers!   :  Many wild flowers in bloom.  This is a nice wild flower hike, with plenty of mountain views.   : For all cars.  There are a few big potholes to look out for, but most cars can drive around them easily.   There is wash-boarding.  Many said the Corral Pass road is out, so I believed them.  Therefore, you need to go to the Dalles Ridge Access.     First, Google Maps was spot on, going the Road 7222 access.  I plugged in “Noble Knob Dalles Ridge Access.”  Google Maps converted it to “Noble Knob, 1 NF-7222, Enumclaw, WA 98022” and it took us exactly to the trailhead listed below; although this is not the trailhead listed on the WTA description.  This trail is very good and easy to follow, although this trail is pretty difficult to follow.  The Google Maps trail follows   directions pretty well.  I will reprint these directions with my additions/modifications:    Go about 20 miles from Enumclaw, past Mile sign 44 (45?), and turn left onto Road 70, which is well marked.    Proceed about six miles to Road 72, which is marked on the left side of the road.  Turn right onto Road 72.  The trailhead is about 7.3 miles from the time you turn onto FS 72.  You will pass a shooting range and follow the road right.    Note your odometer when you turn onto 72, because 0.6 miles up you'll reach your first Y.  Stay left onto 7220 (marked 72 on google maps, but here we saw a sign saying 7220).    Another 1 miles from there (1.6 so far), stay to the right onto 7222.    Going up another 3.5 miles stay left and continue to follow 7222 (you've gone 5.1 miles to this point).    Drive 1 mile or so (about 6.2 miles total), you go left.  Drive up 7222 for another 1.2 miles and you will reach a little turn off on the right hand side of the road that looks like a spot for a U-turn.    The trail head is about 200 yards up the road on the right.    Total mileage from beginning of 72 was 7.3 miles.    Lastly, when you get to the trail head and hit the trail, take the path that goes left (heads up), not the path that goes right (and down).

Cold Creek Loop via Tinkham and Silver Peaks	daugman	Minor obstacles posing few problems	Road rough but passable	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	We hiked this loop (but not Tinkham or Silver peaks).  Our loop mileage was 7 miles, with cumulative gain of 2750 feet (fair amount of up and down).  Our moving time was 3 hrs 30 min, and we also stopped many times adding 1 hr 30 to the total time. Bugs didn't bother us...but we all applied a lot of bug repellent before hiking.   The reports of "lots of foliage in your way" exaggerate the problem.  We never lost sight of the trail and only had about 3 different 50 yard segments of lots of bushes.  I wore long pants and long shirt while my friends wore shorts.  None of us had problems. This was a great choice on a hot day; nearly all of the hike is in the woods.  And then once you reach the PCT you get some nice partial views to the north. 2 of us are strong hikers and had no problems with the only steep part...the ascent from Twin Lakes up to joining the PCT.  Our 3rd member is slightly less in shape and was a bit winded (you gain a lot of vertical) but also had no problems. Lots of blueberries in many places along this trail	Aug 07, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-08.1987201287
Mount McCausland	RedmondRain	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Arriving at 10:30, we were surprised to find the trailhead full of cars. We took the last spot and were quickly on the trail. We were bit by bugs as we applied our 100% DEET at the trailhead, but despite buzzing, the bug spray kept them at bay for the rest of the hike. Aside from one tree across the trail near the trailhead, the trail is in great shape. The hike up the switchbacks was fun and we were cruising along the PCT. We took a short break at the turn to McCausland that was nicely marked with a rock cairn. Then we started our way up. The trail gets steeper and steeper and the last half mile was tough for us. It is easy to lose the trail at the grade break with lots of alternate paths in every direction. We made the wrong choice of going left, again at a stacked rock cairn that told us we should have gone right.  Views of the lake were amazing as we worked our way up to the summit, and that was the highlight. Once at the summit, we admired the hazy panorama, although nothing really compared to the lake view on the way up. Dogs were hot, spending much of their time seeking shade at the end, and we managed to work our way through 2 liters of water each on our way to the summit, with not much water left for the way back down.  The 12 year old took a break admiring the lake view while some of us completed the summit. Everyone was happy.	Aug 07, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-08.5664243326
Image Lake via Miners Ridge	ricks5	Minor obstacles posing few problems	Road rough but passable	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	We had a great four night trip up to Image Lake. Day one we started at Suiattle River trailhead. At 2 miles in we hit the log jam that has the trail blocked. It’s a little tight but we were able to get thru without removing our packs. We stopped for the night just before the junction with the Miner’s Ridge trail. Other than the log jam the trail was in great shape and water was plentiful.  Day two we made the climb up to Miner’s Ridge, which is no joke. The first set of switchbacks still had plenty of water but the second set is dry. There are two good creeks just before the start of the second set of switchbacks and that’s the last water until you get to Image Lake. We made camp at the upper camps southeast of the Image lake and stayed there for two nights. There were other campers around but it wasn’t crowded at all. The bugs weren’t too bad but having a head net was really nice around dusk.  Day three we kept our camp and day hiked over to Suiattle Pass to where the PCT detours towards Holden. The sky got hazier today from the smoke so the views toward Glacier Peak weren’t as good as the day before. Day four we packed up and started back down. On the way we made the side trip over to the lookout tower and met Russ, who was an informative and gracious host. If you’re heading up there, he’d love a “fresh salad with sweet onion and garden fresh tomatoes”. We then made the jarring descent down the 39 switchbacks and made camp for the night below the Suspension Bridge on the west side of Canyon Creek. Day five we hiked the rest of the way out. The log jam was a little muddier from all the hikers headed up for the weekend but it was still passable without removing our packs.

Copper Ridge	jmj2012	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Hiked clockwise from Hannegan Trailhead.  First night was Egg Lake.  Make sure you fill up on water at Copper Lake because there isn't water until near the river crossing.  Second night was Indian Creek.  Last night Copper Creek.  Chilliwack crossing was not a problem.  Mid calf, cold, and not that swift.  Follow the pink flagging across the river channels.  A bit brushy in places.  You can also ford the river or take the cable car (bring gloves) for the other river crossing.  No bears, although a few others we talked to saw a few.  Bugs weren't bad, except near the trailhead where the flies were a nuisance.  Lucked out on the weather except it was hot and saw a very small wildfire on the other side of the valley.

Glacier Peak	GottaloveGoats	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were not too bad	Trail snow-covered at times - gear and expertise recommended	We planned on a 3 day trip with the intent of summiting Glacier Peak. Due to the closure of the North Fork Sauk trail #649 at the time, we extended the trip to four days to allow us an extra night at Blue Lake on our descent down the Pilot Ridge trail.   We started at the North Fork Sauk trail at roughly 8:15 am, trekked through the lush old growth, in which huckleberries were abundant. The first few miles rolled up and down gradually through old growth before reaching large open patches where the humidity and bugs became somewhat of an annoyance, but nothing unmanageable. After making our way through the first five miles of gradual ascent, we reached the Mackinaw Shelter where we came across USFS workers bringing gear up the trail to White Pass in preparation for the rock blasting they had scheduled the next few days, which was the reason we planned on coming down Pilot Ridge. After a quick break at the Mackinaw Shelter, we began our trek up the ~2900ft of switchbacks up to the PCT. These switchbacks are punishing, but at least give you gorgeous views on the ascent. There was a lack of water fillups past the North Fork Sauk at Mackinaw, so be prepared to wait until the PCT to fill up. After reaching the PCT, the traverse to White Pass feels like nothing compared to the switchbacks. After a quick break at White pass, we continued along the Foam Creek trail until reaching Becky's route, where the trail gets a bit more technical, going down some steep granite, only to ascend a sandy/gravel coated hill into the glacier basin, where you are rewarded with a view of Glacier Peak. We traversed roughly a mile and a half into the basin and camped at the base of the remnants of the White Chuck Glacier. Bugs were not existent in the basin. There were only a few streams running clean, and those were melted from snowpack, as the glacier melt off was silty and dark.  Waking at 4:30 am, we packed our daypacks and left our heavy packs in the tent, bringing only the essentials. We left camp at roughly 6 am, followed the cairned trail through the basin over the rock fields until reaching Glacier Gap at 7:10 am. From the gap, we followed the snow-free Gerdine ridge to the base of the Disappointment Cleaver, where we tossed on our crampons and dawned our ice axes. We traversed across the top of the Suiattle Glacier below the Disappointment Cleaver, which rocks were falling from frequently, and rocketing down the glacier. After reaching the wrap around to the Cool Glacier, we encountered 4 crevasses between here and the beginning of the last snow free ridge to the summit. We did rope up at the beginning of the Cool Glacier, but in retrospect, this probably was unnecessary, as the crevasses were easily visible and crossable. From the top of the Cleaver, we followed the trail up the sandstone to the base of the last scramble to the peak, which was on a rather thin snowfield, which lasted about 200'. The views at the summit were well worth the burning legs on the last scramble. We spent roughly 10 minutes at the summit before beginning our descent, as it was getting late in the day (12 pm)and the snow was getting softer. The crevasses were even easier to see on the way down, making for a quick descent. I would recommend camping in the Glacier Gap, or starting earlier than we did if you camp in the basin, as the snow got a little too soft for my liking that late in the day.  After reaching camp at 3:45 pm, we  After sleeping in post-summit day, we began our trek towards Blue lake on the PCT at 11 am. It took us roughly 3 1/2 hours to get to the Dishpan Gap, where we strayed off the PCT onto the Bald Eagle trail. After a half mile or so, we opted to take the Blue lake high route to save some distance. The way up the high route became a little challenging at times, considering a heavy pack, but nothing technical. After a quick ascent and descent down the high route, we reached Blue lake. The water was very clear, with lots of 15+ inch trout visible. The bugs were yet again considerable, but a campfire managed to keep the majority away.  Leaving Blue lake at roughly 8 am, we make our way up the ridge to where the Johnson Mountain trail takes off from the Pilot Ridge trail, huckleberries are rampant on this ridge, along with some very nice Bolete Mushrooms. A trek across ~5 Miles of ridgeline brought us to the top of the switchbacks, where the descent to the North Fork Sauk began, roughly 30 Switchbacks and 3000' feet of descent brought us to the N. Fork Sauk River, where a few foot wide logs lay across the river serving as a bridge. After getting back on N. Fork Sauk trail we stumbled down the last 2 miles to the trailhead, where a large posting was, showing the closure of the switchbacks on the N. Fork Sauk trail.  Great loop to summit Glacier Peak. What I would note: -Fill up on water where you can, and ration, as water was sparse in areas.  -Bring bug spray/nets.  -Actual glacier traverse and ascent in good shape as of 8/8/18.

Meander Meadow - Dishpan Gap - Cady Ridge Loop	Steve	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	A very fine short loop. Little Wenatchee River trail is quite brushy in the open areas. A couple of streams are still running in this stretch if you need water. The climb out of the valley into Meander Meadow is a grind, especially on a hot day like I had, but thankfully it's not a long pull. Camped 2 nights in the meadow. As you drop into the meadow, two well-defined tent pads on its central stream are quite "horsey". If you walk to the right (north-ish), cross the stream and then loop back left there's a cleaner pad (basically just across the stream from the other two.) More wild flowers along this stream than I expected to see in mid-August, including Elephant's Head. squee! Dayhiked on Day 2 to Kodak Peak and Blue Lake. Fantastic view of Glacier Peak from the PCT. Had the meadow all to myownself this night. Glorious! Exited on Day 3—still hot and sky now quite hazy now due to wild fires—up out of the meadow to the PCT, then south and out via Cady Ridge. As you would expect, there is no water along Cady Ridge. I	Aug 07, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-11.9689758255
Tuck and Robin Lakes	SorachiAce	Minor obstacles posing few problems	Road rough but passable	Bugs were terrible	Snow free	We laced up our shoes Tuesday morning and headed out to the beautiful Tuck and Robin Lakes The parking lot was quite full. We braved the 90 degree heat and started the gentle grade along Lake Hylas. The trail then starts to climb up to the turn off to Tuck and Robin Lakes and is in great condition. From here the trail becomes quite challenging. It's very steep with lots of loose footing. We got to our camp at Tuck Lake all tuckered out. There were a few other campers at Tuck but we had the northern shore all to ourselves. The mosquitoes were very BAD!!  Bright and early the next morning we started our climb to Robin Lakes. This was a 1.5 mile trek that took us 2.5 hours. The trail climbs 1,000 feet in the first mile through a steep bootpath. Our motto was "If you want to see a Mountain Goat, you have to be a Mountain Goat" We made it to the lake and were blown away by the beauty. The tough hike was totally worth it. We found a great campsite on the outcropping on the southern end. There we had our own private pond to swim in and sweeping views. As for the goats, we saw one on the trail as we climbed up to Robin, and a whole family hanging out on the hillside above our camp. The mosquitoes were terrible in the evening and made us retreat to our tent early, but the hot sunny day at Robin Lake made it a trip to remember.

Gothic Basin	webberjames95	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Intermittent snow - not hard to cross	A good hike today. August means the trail is mostly clear of obstructions. Single tree over trail you have to climb over about three miles in. Duck under another tree about 1/4 mike from top. Other than that this trail is pretty sweet but steeper than the elevation gain/mileage will show. Just put that in your mind before you go. But don’t let that deter you from coming out here you should definitely come.  Once in basin it’s quite beautiful. Be careful not to miss the lakes there are a lot. It was 80°+ when we were up here so you know we had to swim in the lakes. Coldest water I’ve ever been in when we got into Foggy lake. And I’ve swam in lots of glacial lakes/lakes in Alaska.  Take your time and go to Foggy lake for sure. Worth it. Just a little scramble up. Picture time cuz that’s what you’re here for!

Grand Park via Lake Eleanor	perrin	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were terrible	Snow free	Arrived late to the trail head at around 4 pm and only saw one other car in the lot. We swam at the lake before heading all the way up to Grand Park. Big mistake forgetting bug spray! This was the most bug filled hike I've ever been on for sure. We saw a few deer and an Elk, and some old bear poop and tracks. Really fun and easy hike!	Aug 07, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-08.6593515629
Cascade Pass and Sahale Arm	Mblekhter	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	Spectacular hike, with the bonus of a bear and her cubs just a few minutes past the trailhead. We made plenty of noise and they got off the trail so we could pass. They seemed quite used to hikers passing through their territory.  Plenty of ripe huckleberries early in the trail too (until the bear finishes them)	Aug 07, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-08.7162961122
Snow Lake	Jay	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Arrived at the trailhead by 10am and there was already plenty of people there (even though it was a Tuesday). The trail is pretty rocky but in great shape. It was close to 90 degrees so jumping in the lake was a great way to cool off! The bugs were not too bad at all either. This is a great hike, easily accessible and not too difficult.  Make sure to check out the video to really see how beautiful this hike is!

Evergreen Mountain Lookout	Caitlin  C	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	The road up to the trail is rough. Passable but rough for a small sedan. The trail itself was great, although covered in bugs. Bring bug spray or be prepared to not stop moving. They only got worse at the top. There was a decent view at the top....would have been better if there wasn't as much wildfire smoke. Overall well worth the effort. Beautiful and peaceful hike!

Poo Poo Point 	cascadesdj	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	I have hiked the Chirico Trail to PPP several times and always wanted to try the High School Trail, so today I had the time and did it. I started at the small parking area just south of the HS. I was the only one there at 1 pm but at 4 pm there were about 5 cars. It is much less travelled than the CT, and I saw just 6 other hikers the whole time I was on the hike. It is also longer; it took me 1:39 to summit compared with the 1 hour it takes me on the CT. The HS trail comes in thirds. The first third is easy, the second moderate, and the last part, which starts soon after crossing the long wooden bridge over the still flowing creek, is definitely a step up in grade, esp on a hot day. One bummer about this trail is that it ends by descending to PPP, which means you have to climb back up a couple of hundred feet to go back down. In the heat today, that was unfortunate. Anyway, I got back down in 1:22. Poo Poo Point was as gorgeous as ever, with a refreshing strong breeze, great views out over Issaquah and Lk Sammamish, and paragliders lazily swooping around. I’m summary, I do prefer the Chirico Trail, but am glad to have finally explored the HS one. 	Aug 07, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-07.5549757001
Lewis Creek Trail - Bellevue	karnage	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Today we started our hike at the Visitor Center at Lewis Creek Park.  Heading north we followed the wide gravel half mile loop with an end at the playground just south of the Visitor Center.  Blackberries arent ripe yet, but my kid was satisfied with touching the cattails.  The loop is stroller friendly. The visitor center here is open Wed-Sat and I recommend a stop in there.  They have some neat stuff for kids to check out - pelts, bones, taxidermy and scat moulds. There are soft surface trails that connect from the north side of the loop to the picnic area, and beyond that you can go as far as the gorge mentioned in other trip reports below. My favorite stretch is the bit of trail going north off the picnic area with vine maples bridged over the trail, dripping moss and old growth stumps.  It feels like fairies live there.  Anyway, enjoy your trip!  #hikeathon	Aug 07, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-07.9677375305
Gobblers Knob	Wander_the_pnw	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were terrible	Snow free	If it's possible to love a destination but dislike the hike, this is surely it. The view from Gobblers Knob is wonderful and quite a sight to behold. The price getting there is a 3+ mile walk up a dusty, exposed FS road which is home to swarming flies straight from hell. I don't really mean to be dramatic but seriously, it's bad. I'd note though that coming back down that same road on the return, the bugs were so much better. Perhaps the heat of the day kept them at bay. Once you reach the actual TH, the bugs are no worse than usual IMO but wow that initial 3 mile walk was awful. It was quite hazy/smokey up at the top and given that and the flies I would encourage others to hold off until it's less hazy as it's a heavy price to pay and you want to be able to have the ideal view.  Happy trails.	Aug 07, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-07.1886933533
Snow Lake	Boulderdash457	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Took a short Monday morning hike to Snow Lake. The road was completely clear, and the trail was in good condition. Made it down to the lake in about 80 min, hung around for a while, and hiked back for a total trip time of 190 min, finishing about noon. There were plenty of people on the trail, but not enough to make it feel crowded.	Aug 07, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-07.8075019307
Boardman Lake	MCTripp	Trail in good condition	Road recommended for high clearance only	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Road conditions are the same as the previous reports.  Hike was nice.  There is an active fire somewhere near there.  We could hear the choppers doing bucket drops and may have seen the smoke on the lake.  Thought it was fog until we passed a guy on our way out that asked if we could see the fire.  It may be over by Ashland lake, there was flagging tape on the road that goes up there.  Checked the wildfire websites and there is nothing shown for that area.

American Lake	salamander	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	Overnight to American Lake, from Chinook Pass. PCT is in fine shape, as is trail 958 from the PCT to the junction with American Ridge and down to Cougar Lake. Maybe one blowdown to step over the entire way. We left Chinook Pass late in the day, which may have worked in our favor for crowds near the trailhead and keeping a bit more in the shade, since the trail tends to the East slopes for the first few miles. Past Dewey Lake, saw almost no-one, just a single camper near Anderson Lake. Bugs fairly bad at Dewey so we didn't stick around long. American lake is a beauty, tucked just below the un-named (on my map) peak 5740 along the ridge; this might make for better breezes because bugs were generally not too bad at American Lake. There was a period about an hour before sunset when the breezes died and the bugs came in, then left for the half hour or so before sunset. Perfect for sunset and star watching. Smokey haze was there, but not too bad. Side trip over to Cougar Lakes. Lots of wildflowers, and frogs. That's a lovely spot as well. American lake was just perfect for a cool off swim, without that ice cold seizure feeling.	Aug 07, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-13.4877371926
High Divide - Seven Lakes Basin Loop	Snofzig	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	This is really a wonderful trip, and it can take you as long as you like. We did a 3 day backpack, starting at the Sol duc falls trailhead (well paved road all the way there) then spending the first night at deer lake, around 4 ish miles in. Lots of camping areas by the various lakes, and since permits are required (and will be checked) there should be plenty of space. Our second day involved crossing the high divide itself, and a bonus trip into the 7 lakes basin. This is a beautiful hike, and although it is a long way with plenty of elevation, the views are second to none. Seeing Mount Olympus, glaciers, alpine lakes, and the Hoh, and Bogachiel river valleys make the views that much better. We spend our second night at the campsite just beyond sol duc park, and had plenty of space to enjoy. Finally we hiked back along the section of the trail that goes about 4 miles along the Sol duc river before joining the Sol duc falls trail back to the trailhead. I would definitely recommend taking this side trip if you are just visiting the falls, and it is a nice walk to end a weekend of backpacking. Along the river you will encounter several waterfalls that where not marked on my map, and are really a great add on to any Sol Duc Falls trip, (although this will significantly increase the mileage if you are just going for the falls). The total 18 (or 20 if you add on Bogachiel peak and a trip into the 7 lakes basin) mile trip can be done in a day (we saw several day hikers and some trail runners) but the stars out there can't be beat and I would highly recommend doing an overnight or multi-day trip through the area. Great hike that I would definitely do again. Make sure to get your permits at the Wilderness Information Center in Port Angeles, or make a reservation 2 weeks in advance (or more). You will also need to carry and store all food in a freely provided bear can, so make sure you leave some room in your pack if you are doing a multi-day adventure. Requires an Olympic National Park Pass (Day or Annual) or an America the Beautiful Pass to park. For overnight trips costs are $8 per person per day. Make sure to get to the WIC early if you are getting a permit without a reservation, as lines can be long, and you want to get a bear canister and permits while still available. They hold 50% of the permits for walk ins, but have a backup plan just in case.	Aug 07, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-11.1972429622
Snow Lakes	guardianbee	Obstacles on trail:	    Trees down across trail,	    Muddy or wet trail.	Road suitable for all vehicles	Did a 4 day trip to Upper Snow Lake in hopes to get in some day hiking in the core Enchantments as well, didn't go entirely as planned... Trail was a lot harder than all 6 of us expected, be prepared for that elevation gain! Boulder fields were very difficult to cross (especially with packs) and we frequently found ourselves unable to follow the trail through this. Camped at Nada Lake and Upper Snow Lake, day hiking into the core was ridiculously strenuous and we all found it not worth the strain for the sights, which is something I wish I had read more online. Day hike from Upper Snow Lake took 6+ hours and was less than 6 miles total to only see ONE lake (Lake Vivianne)!! Nada Lake and Lower Snow Lake were both very buggy and muddy, Upper Snow Lake was beautiful, clear, and bug-free (and totally swimmable!). The bugs were ferocious, our 30 DEET was utterly useless and our only hope at the campsite was to stay inside the tent, I would highly recommend bringing stronger bug deterrents. 	Aug 07, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-10.8790502909
Comet Falls	Jennekehikes	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Arrived at the parking lot at 7:30 and were the third car there. The trail is in good condition, though the rocky areas might be a challenge for kiddos or anyone with short legs. Bugs were out but weren't too bad. Some wildflowers are out, as well as some huckleberries and a few remaining salmonberries. Comet Falls was our destination this trip, and we were fortunate enough to have the falls to ourselves for a moment of peace while a goat grazed on the ridge above and a marmot snacked on flowers across the stream below. Only passed saw 2 groups of hikers on the way to the falls, but a steady stream of hikers was heading up on our return to the car.  If you have the time, definitely extend your trip by following the trail up to Van Trump Park and Mildred Point!

Deception Creek	Skyvalley Hiker	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	No bugs	Snow free	An enjoyable walk up the first 1/2 mile of the Deception Creek trail. It was 87 degrees out at home, but very pleasant in the forest, with a cool breeze coming down the creek. There are at least 2 great pools in this creek for swimming in, with crystal clear water about 10 feet deep. One is right at the beginning of the trail, and the other at about 1/2 mile, above the first bridge. We only saw one other person, and 3 cars at the trail head. Only a couple bugs.

West Cady Ridge to Benchmark Mountain	Exmoor	Minor obstacles posing few problems	Road impassable/closed	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	I'd been meaning to do this hike for several years, but the trailhead situation has made it difficult for the last few years. NF-63 is closed and you have to walk or bike 4.5 miles to the trailhead. Since I finally have a mountain bike I figured that would make it doable.  I had heard that Blanca Lake was a very popular hike, but I was downright dumbstruck to pull up at the trailhead at 5:30am and find at least one part disembarking already. A few other cars were present, but they have been overnighters.  NF-63 has two-three major washouts before the Blanca Lake trailhead, but the rest of the road is easily bike-able. The remaining road to the West Cady Ridge trailhead is not in as good of shape. Large sections have obviously become a creek in wet weather and there is about a foot of erosion. These areas require walking your bike and can be a bit dicey if you come upon them too quickly on your way back to your car. The road is not too steep, but I still had to walk a good portion of it and it took me about 80 minutes to reach the trailhead.  After stashing my bike a made my way up the trail. The first 2-3 miles is forested with quite a few switchbacks. The creeks within the first mile were the last running water I saw all day, so take note. Other than a little bit of overgrowth in a few select spots, the trail is in great condition here. No blowdowns at all.  Towards the top of the ridge the trail opens up a bit into sub-alpine forest with increasing meadowed areas. Overall the trail is in good shape here, but there is a lot more overgrowth. No blowdowns, but there were two small trees that have basically grown to completely block the trail. I'm not even sure trimming the branches would help the worse one, so perhaps it should be removed? About 5 miles in you ascend a small peak before descending again. Here I found a small, shallow pond (30ft x 15ft x 1ft?) The water wasn't great looking, but I filtered it on my way back and it seemed fine. Given its size, I'm not sure we should expect it to persist throughout the late summer and fall. There's another even smaller pond shortly past that. At this point the ridge opens up into a fairly wide, relatively flat grass meadow. I was hoping for some interesting bird sightings, but the meadows were pretty dead. Here I encountered the only blocking blowdown of the entire 22 miles I traveled. It was fairly large, but easily stepped over.  At roughly 7 miles I summited Benchmark Mountain. It's barely a bump above the rest of the ridge, but the view is nice. There was a meadow down below with several shallow ponds, but I didn't have time to explore. When I finally stopped it after wandering around at the top a bit, my GPS said I'd walked 7.5 miles and gained 3500ft. There was a small patch of snow here, but it looked like it will be gone soon.  I'd mostly been interested in the birds on this trip, but it was super quiet on the way out. Thankfully once I hit the top of Benchmark thinks really picked up. On the way back I had two Golden Eagles at different spots, which was a great treat.  West Cady Ridge is a great hike, but a long one, especially with the additional 4.4 miles of walkable road. You can tell a ton of work went in to this trail and despite minimal use these days (I was the only person I saw all day) its held up well. Hopefully the road can be repaired in the not-too-distant future and more people can experience this lovely hike. Just make sure you pack enough water!

Snow Lake	Jay	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Arrived at the trailhead at around 10am and already knew before we got there that a ton of people would be there. (Even being a Tuesday). The trail was great though and even with the people, we were able to hike alone. The day was close to 90 degrees so it felt great to take a dip in the lake to cool off. This is a great trail for a quick hike to one of the prettier alpine lakes around. Avoid it on the weekends though!

The incline can be pretty difficult to deal with as it was nonstop elevation gain throughout nearly the entire hike. The bugs at the top are brutal and swarming.

Explorer Falls	BKREBBS	Obstacles on trail:	    .	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Today me and my husband hiked this trail with our dog! Parking wasn’t too big. There’s enough space for 4-5 cars. However today we only saw one car when we arrived, that left soon after and one car that parked as we were coming back, so I’m assuming the small parking isn’t an issue. I’m glad I read these reviews before going because you have to go around the closed gate to enter! My mind says if there’s a gate do not enter haha but I guess this wasn’t the case with this hike. So then about .5 miles maybe down the gravel path there was a sign that led us to the trail. Overall it was nice. Sun was shining. Wasn’t too hot. Bugs were annoying but we didn’t get bit. We did come to another closed gate and again had to go around it! The waterfall was hard to find. We actually passed it and went about a half mile further. So we turned back. There’s a rocked form arrow on the ground next to the entrance of the waterfall “trail” I guess. We saw it the first time but didn’t understand how to get to the waterfall.  Figured out you have to go along the river on the rocks. We ended up actually crossing the river to another trail and going up the mountain to get to the top of the waterfall. If kids aren’t present would recommend! It’s a nice hike and cool to see over the waterfall but the path is very narrow and steep in some areas where you will slide if you don’t get your footing right. Got some scratches from sliding and climbing haha but overall was a great adventure!	Aug 07, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-07.5711629798

Naches Peak Loop	hayleefaye	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Hiked this loop for a Monday afternoon adventure. We started at about 12:30 and the parking lot was surprisingly full with long bathroom lines. Even with the full parking lot, the trail didn't feel like a traffic jam at all and we were able to enjoy our hike. We hiked the loop clockwise and stopped at the first lake to have lunch and swim. Water wasn't too cold and the bugs weren't too bad. After our swim, we continued on the loop and stopped again at the viewpoint for Dewey Lakes. Smoke was definitely inhibiting our views, especially on Rainier, so be aware of that. The wildflowers are in full bloom and the intense coloring of the Indian Paintbrush is just breathtaking. The Heather, Lupine, Arnica and everything else is also gorgeous. Finished our leisurely hike at 3:30ish and headed home! Definitely recommend this hike for the views, swimming, and wildflowers! #watrailsday	Aug 06, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-08.2339056244

Immediately noticed several cars with their back windows busted out. Not cool at all. I was super uncomfortable seeing that and but still decided to go for it. Upon exiting my car, I stepped right out into a pile of glass and window tint. UH. WTF is wrong with people!  Started hiking around 9:45. There were no bugs and tons of fat salmon berries! The water crossings weren't bad. Easy if you have poles and take your time.  Most of the time this isn't a problem I encounter but maybe a refresher on trail etiquette is needed for some?  We did go and check the last creek crossing but didn't feel comfortable crossing with our dog. Instead we back tracked to the climbers route (there's a sign for it) and went up. It's steep but short and delivers allllll the views. Overall great day!

Dirty Harry's Connector	Taum Sauk	Obstacles on trail:	    Trees down across trail.	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Dirty Harry’s Deja View Day #6 between jobs. It seems that just 4 years ago, I took this same walk under similar circumstances. The Connector links the Ira Spring Trailhead (IST) and the Putrid Pete's Peak (P3) trail with the route that leads up to the summit of Dirty Harry's Peak. I thought that I would visit an old friend and make sure that Dirty Harry’s truck had not found a new parking space.    We started at 11:20 am. The parking lot at the IST was nearly full, which should be surprising on a weekday, but rumor is that the hiking bugs are multiplying rapidly. Yet another excuse to go off the beaten path, so to speak. The Connector takes off unceremoniously as a bootpath heading left, 0.1 mile from the IST’s starting point. The connector drops and gains (gains is the operative word) altitude through a western hemlock, Doug fir, and alder forest. It gains approximately 500 feet over its first mile, up to 2700 feet and then dips up and down until reaching the junction with the Balcony trail. At 0.9 miles there is a fork—go left and down to stay on the Connector and reach the Dirty Harry trail. There is a side trail to a lesser-known balcony, 1.3 miles from the start, which looks west, gives a commanding view of the pass, and is higher than Dirty Harry’s Balcony. Several small creeks cross the Connector, which provided for water on the return trip and some steep slopes to navigate. There are some small, easily passable blowdowns along the Connector trail. Vine maple, thimbleberry, red huckleberry, and cascade Oregon grape provide much of the ground cover. There were ripe blackberries, thimbleberries, and red huckleberries. Wildflowers were foxglove, pearly everlasting, fireweed, candy flower, bleeding heart, and Herb-Robert. Engelmann spruce still guard either side of the midpoint talus field crossing. At points, the trail is somewhat faint, but it has been marked by logs that run alongside the trail in places. We reached the junction with the Balcony side trail and visited the Balcony, 2 miles and 1.5 hours of hiking after our start. Large rocks have been placed along the edges of the Connector and the Balcony trails, marking the intersection well. There is no sign, however.  We proceeded uphill from the balcony on the Peak trail. It has undergone maintenance, with placement of new rock stairs and even a bench viewpoint. 2.6 miles into the journey we encountered a cable jutting into the trail, about 100 feet before the crossing of Museum Creek. We turned to the right, scrambled uphill, and reached an old logging road. We followed the old road southeast 0.15 mile and switchbacked northeast, and 0.15 mile later we reached the truck, at 2 pm (2.5 hours into the journey). It is still parked facing north, 3250 feet above sea level. The return trip was somewhat faster and took 2 hours. Most of us ran out of water on the return leg, and we refilled our water supplies from the creeks that cross the Connector. I had brought a 1L mix of Gatorade and water, which was clearly inadequate for Dirty Harry in August. This is a difficult hike, and not for beginners, given the poorly marked/defined trail, treacherous tread, and frequent changes in grade. It would be safest to bring a good map, preferably with a GPS track. Some segments have strenuous elevation gain. The Connector is not on the Green Trails Map 206 Bandera, either. I must have been better conditioned when I walked this route 4 years ago; this time, I felt the up-and-down more intensely. The Strava app indicated 1900 feet of elevation gain overall, even though the net change was only 1000 feet. My advice is to bring 1.5-2L of water, sturdy hiking boots, and trekking poles for this excursion. Dress in layers and wear sunscreen, because the Dirty Harry’s Peak section is sun-exposed.

Annette Lake	sraykens	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Arrived at the parking lot at 10:30am and it was nearly empty (Monday morning).  The hike is nice and sheltered, so great for a hot sunny day.  Unfortunately that means the views are hidden almost until the lake, except for a few talus slopes. The lake is a beautiful emerald color and surrounded by some nice peaks.  We had a great time swimming - the water was perfect for swimming.  The shore isn't the greatest for barefoot action, though.  So I recommend to bring a raft and bring some water shoes and spend the day just floating in the lake.  	Aug 06, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-07.4209895137
Sheep Lake to Sourdough Gap	Lucy	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	This is a very pleasant hike with lots of things to look including wildflowers, cool rock formations, mountain, birds, meadows and lakes. At the beginning of the hike, the trail parallels the highway for a short distance. As a result you get some traffic noise but the flowers in this section will take your mind off the noise. Soon you will head away from the road and the trail leads into a nice forest. In just under 2 miles you will reach Sheep Lake which is surrounded by pretty peaks and lovely meadows. From here you can venture to Sourdough Gap which is achieved by walking on the right side (north side) of the lake. The trail is steep but relatively short, about a tad over one mile. This route becomes interesting with a variety in terrain. You cross meadows and open spaces that eventually leads to views of Mount Rainier and Crystal Lake. After enjoying the area, a descent down to the trailhead is easy.  I saw several small children walking with their parents to the lake and a few campers by the lake. A couple of grouse were roused out of their comfort zone and seen flying up to nearby trees. The road to Chinook Pass was lined with spectacular flowers. Best I've seen this season. Made a short side trip to Naches Loop trail. The flowers were quite pretty and better than expected. Lots of folks on this trail even for a weekday.  It was a surprisingly good day. While there was haze in the air, I enjoyed the quiet beauty of this area. And a bonus - no bugs to deal with!	Aug 06, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-06.1108791049
Coal Creek Trail	TiffanyBerry	Obstacles on trail:	    Trees down across trail.	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Though it's not mentioned in the description (which will hopefully be updated to include the rest of the trail system in the Coal Creek Natural Area), the trail system continues north (west) of the parking lot on Coal Creek Blvd.  It does this by going under the roadway and then heading towards 119th.  It's not a long trail, but it's a nice bit of wilderness in the middle of suburbia. The trail has a few holes in the tread, and has a wild array of sun-baked mud, mulch, gravel, and mounds of dust.  It may not be a large elevation gain overall, but it's full of ups and downs (some of which are steep enough to cause you to slip).  It runs along the creek, but being so close to civilization, sometimes can smell in the heat of the summer.  It's also a narrow path, with a drop-off to one side for the majority of it. Overall, if you need a place, it's there.  But the south (east of Coal Creek Blvd) section is a better hiking experience.  (It may also be a more crowded experience.)

Mercer Slough Nature Park Trails	TiffanyBerry	Obstacles on trail:	    .	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	We attempted (and eventually succeeded) a loop around the park that included the Lake to Lake Trail, I-90 Trail, Heritage Trail, and Bellfield Trail.  (Going along the entire periphery, but mostly on boardwalk and barked path.) Only problem?  Construction of the light rail overpasses has confused the middle section on the west side where the P&R used to be.  Expected, but also not signed well at all, and confusing.  (We ended up going into the construction area - after, I think, being directed to do so - where we were then corrected to get out of the area.) We managed anyway.  It was buggy, but not horrible if you kept walking.  It was hot and there isn't consistent shade, so consider the weather and maybe bring a sun umbrella.  It's also noisy due to the road in most parts.  But it's another urban place to stop if you need a nature break.

Mount Pilchuck	CorpsManHM	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	This was my second hike in Mt. Pilchuck.  Coincidentally, not my intention, it was exactly 2 years from today I first hiked this trail.  My first was awesome and my second was the same. Weather: Sunny in the 80s Road to TH:  Once you turn right from Mountain Loop rd to Mt. Pilchuck rd, the smooth road ends and the rough road begins.  Its a dirt road mostly on the way up to the TH parking lot.  The potholes are terrible.  They are not small, but vary in sizes and a lot of them are big and deep.  So proceed with caution.  Any vehicle types are ok.  I had a rav4 and proceeded slowly up to the parking lot.  Arrived at the parking lot at around 5:45 am. TH parking lot wasn't full at this time.  About 3 cars parked.  Around 12:02 pm when we arrived back, the lot was kinda full with a few spots left. Trail Condition:  Trail was pretty groomed and easy to follow.  Wear good hiking boots as you'll be walking on mostly rocks and small size boulders.  Which is also the reason why you need to pay attention to where you walking as you are walking over boulders and rocks mostly on the way up and down.  There are marked signs on certain turns.  You shouldn't have problems finding them.  Terrain was dry and not muddy.  Just a few parts were muddy, but easy to navigate through without dirtying your boots. Bugs:  They are in annoyance today. Bring bug spray.  Though we sparayed ourselves pretty well and still were an annoyance.   Overall:  This is one of my favorite hikes.  The views from the lookout was spectacular.  As well as the views along the way to the top was good as well.  This was a Monday and we started early.  Arrived at the top around    8: 45 am. We were the first to reach the top so wasn't too busy with other hikers, but when we left the top (9:40 am) it was getting busy with hikers.  Definitely recommend this hike to all.  It was pretty hard to ascend, but doable to all level of hikers.

Naches Peak Loop	gck	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	This hike gives incredible payoff for not too much work, and it's unsurprising that it's as popular as it is. It's also a common stop for people who saw the long line of cars to get in Sunrise and changed their plans. If you want to hike with your dog or go swimming or fishing, this isn't the hike for you. It's within the national park, so pets aren't allowed, and people aren't allowed in the lake to protect the rare toads that breed there. Right now, you can see lots of tadpoles in the lake, including some of the toad tadpoles (they're lighter and much larger than the frogs). As the description says, hiking the loop clockwise is the best way to go. Flowers on the loop and at Tipsoo Lake are plentiful right now, though some of it was looking ready to go to seed. Saw a lot of pasqueflower, paintbrush, lupine, aster, and much more.	Aug 06, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-06.2375009815

Lunds Gulch / Meadowdale Beach Park	jenersoz	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	This is a nice hike down to the beach. It has enough elevation to get some cardio and increase the calorie burn.  A bit of a surprise was all the picnic tables and a rangers residence at the trails end.

Ira Spring Trail - Mason Lake	Lunapeople	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Started hiking to Mason Lake on this warm Monday at 9:15, the parking lot had about 15 cars in and several other parties heading up around the same time. Nice to see the new bridge at the crossing along the road portion. Mainly writing to update flowers and berries: Flowers were still nice, I was surprised so many were still in bloom. Berries at the lake are plentiful and just getting ripe enough to enjoy. There were a few black flies and maybe two  mosquitoes. Got buzzed by a hummingbird at the lake! Took our time and back to the car around 2:00. Hot day, we were glad to have hiked the uphill earlier than later. This is a nice hike, and the lake is pretty, but I prefer hikes where you don't hear the highway for quite so long. 	Aug 06, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-07.1083750281

There is some sun exposure so sunscreen and/or a hat are a good idea. A note on the driving directions: my odometer said it was 18.3 miles from the end of the ramp off I-90 to the forest road. At 16.8 miles is a campground. You can see the bridge over the river right before you get to the turn. Then just follow the signs for the Pete Lake TH.

Mount St. Helens - Monitor Ridge	Amylwierenga	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	The recent trip reports are very helpful, I particularly liked the one from July 28 (the breakdown of the hike was spot on). To avoid repetition, I will just add a few observations from our hike today. I had prepared myself for going up, read about the forest, the boulders, and the ash. I knew it was going to be hard, and I was actually feeling good the whole way up (note that we took a lot of breaks). Though the ash was a bit scary - I felt like I could easily fall (poles helped). Anyway, my point is that what I did not expect, was how tough it would be to climb down. I always think of the hard part as climbing up, and I don’t usually have trouble going down. But 4,500 vertical feet is no joke! Even with poles, it was slow going and my knees hurt the whole way, and will hurt the next few days. Take it slow. We took 5.5 hours going up and 4.5 going down. Slow and steady! We enjoyed the views, and there’s nothing quite like looking into the crater from the rim! We left around 5am, and avoided the sun for several hours as we were in the shade of the mountain ridge. The breeze felt amazing, so we were not bothered by heat or even bugs the whole day. It was a great hike, and I highly recommend doing at least once! (Though not as your first hike ever, like one girl we met on the mountain!) You can do it!

Granite Creek Trail to Granite Lakes	Brent	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	First of all, the road to this trail and the accompanying parking lot are likely the best I've ever seen--totally paved, large parking lot, vault toilets.  Secondly, the trail is wide and in great shape.  Check out picture #4 to see just how first-class this trail is (and there were several of these benches throughout the hike).  The trail narrows down after you pass the junction to the Granite Creek Connector but stays in really good condition.  Bugs were limited to mostly annoyingly curious flies.  Didn't see any mosquitos.  I sat by the lake while trying to take pictures of the dragonflies zooming by and didn't get bothered by a single bug (and there was no breeze).  My hike was limited to the big lake as it wasn't clear how to get to the smaller one.  Another hiker I passed by said he only visited the big lake as well since it would require a lot of tromping through thick woods to get to the smaller one. I agree with the elevation gain for the hike description but my GPS called this hike 9.3 miles round trip from where the pavement of the parking lot meets the gravel, to the big lake (no meandering around it either), and back.

Rattlesnake Ledge	ChelseaE06	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	I picked this hike for my first solo hike since I knew it was a busier trail and I haven’t worked up the nerve to venture out alone in less trafficked trails yet. I started late for me- 10 am. Parking lot was only about 1/4 full, which made me happy! I saw maybe about 15 people on the way up. It was humid by Seattle standard, smoky from wildfires, and much of the first half of the trail was the sun. I had surgery recently, so I was really feeling the elements!  The view at the top was beautiful and so worth the work.  Coming down wasn’t quite as enjoyable (and why I’ve avoided this hike). Many large groups of folks- most lacking knowledge of trail ettitique. Dogs off leash, etc. Even though I had to pull over a lot,  I still made it down in about 50 minutes. It took me a little over an hour on the way up. All in all a great first solo hike! Please make sure to bring lots of water in this heat! 16 oz isn’t going to cut it :)	Aug 06, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-06.5778960347
Cherry Creek Falls	natalie&pups	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	This is a great little day hike not too far from the city. I was surprised how much I enjoyed this hike, seeing as I usually hike farther up in the North or Central Cascades! It would be perfect for kids or those who do not hike frequently, or just anyone looking for an easy daytime adventure! The waterfall is a nice reward after an enjoyable stroll along the trail and great for dogs, kids, or even adults to play in. The only thing that can be tricky about this trail is following the correct forks in the trail; just make sure to stay on the larger paths as you go and pass the car wreck after taking the right fork that the trail description mentions above. The trail is mostly shade-covered but has beautiful evergreens and pretty creeks. A pleasant surprise of a trail for a quick but relaxing day! 	Aug 06, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-06.3289180619
Rattlesnake Ledge	cshowalter1	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	I have been wanting to do this hike for awhile now, but due to the reports of people I've avoided it.  Today I wanted a hike I could get to and back in my allotted time so it worked for my time frame.  I arrived at the trailhead parking lot around 12:30pm.  Plenty of parking for a Monday.  The trail itself is mostly shaded and uphill.  It is is great condition.   Even with "plenty of parking" this trail is quite busy.  Multiple people of all hiking levels and experience were out.  Be warned, lots of litter, dogs off leash, and other poor trail etiquette such as blasting stereos.  Despite all this, I really enjoyed my day hike with my dog.  It took me just under an hour to reach the ledge.   Even for a day with lots of haze the views of the lake, Mount Si, and Mount Washington are beautiful.  I hung out at the ledge for probably a good thirty minutes.   On our way down we picked up all the dog poop bags left on the trail - six bags!!!  Sigh.  	Aug 06, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-06.8270754756
Wallace Falls State Park	ninjaracerchick	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Chose Wallace falls today because it’s close to home for a tight schedule and it’s got many great points to stop (when you’re hiking with a toddler you never know how far you can go! Lol). Today we went 2.5miles on the woody trail. Everything is in great shape, no bugs to speak of. Just remember that the parking lot is fairly large but fills up quickly, and you also need a discover pass or have to pay a fee. 	Aug 06, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-06.6029513944
Surprise Lake	Hiker468369	Obstacles on trail:	    .	Road impassable/closed	No bugs	Roads closed due to fires. No entry to area.	Aug 06, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-06.7508865046
Dodger Point	Joerg Zuend	Obstacles on trail:	    Trees down across trail,	    Difficult stream crossing(s),	    Muddy or wet trail,	Please read PNA's trip report from September 2017. It is all still very accurate. I hiked the same loop and found it all correct. I add the following: This may be difficult to do in two days if you have to walk up the Whiskey Bend. I came with a bicyle to cover the 6.5 miles to the trailhead (since the raod into the NP is closed). With taking some side routes I still hiked 38 miles during the two days. I did not have a tent with me and the mosquitos on Dodger Point were annoying. When the sun set though they disappeard until the morning as it was cool enough and there was a light breeze. So I got a good night rest. The Elwha stream crossing is about belly button deep (I am 5.9 tall). But there is little danger of being swept away. The route finding down from Dodger Point at times is not easy. Especially after crossing meadows I had to search forth and back for a while to find the route again. If going the other direction to find the route after crossing the Elwha may take awhile since there is no path directly at the Elwha and when you find it it will be shallow at first. Cannot beat the sunrise and sunset on Doger Point. I add two pictures.	Aug 06, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-06.9459153153
Goat Ridge - Cispus Basin - Snowgrass Loop	Ken Myer	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	A beautiful (but hot and a bit smoky) multi-day backpacking loop trip to the Goat Rocks Wilderness.  Headed out Monday morning from the Berry Patch Trailhead up Goat Ridge.  Camped at Goat Lake, then stayed above Snowgrass Flats (with day hike to Old Snowy), and finally in Cispus Basin before heading out on Snowgrass Flats trail. While the wildfires obscured views of Mt. Rainier and Mt. Adams, the local vistas, flowers, marmots and fresh berries kept us satisfied. There was a minor snow crossing near the PCT at Old Snowy Mountain but otherwise the trail was completely clear.  Bring your bug juice and if you have the option, stay at higher elevations where they aren't a significant problem.   #HikingtheState	Aug 06, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-12.7201745314
Old Snowy Mountain - Elk Pass	letsgobobby	Obstacles on trail:	    Trees down across trail.	Road recommended for high clearance only	Bugs were terrible	Shemmayemma (age 8) and I planned a 5 day, 35 mile backpack loop following Doug Lorain’s suggestion in his book, Backpacking Washington. Day 1: got to trailhead at Lily basin at 10 am and headed out at 10:20. We arranged a drop off so we could hike through to our car at Packwood Lake TH. The road is fine with the significant exception of a deep ravine around mile 8. We appreciated the high clearance of our SUV. A car would probably make it, but it might bottom out pretty bad. This trail has been vastly improved since I last hiked it 7 years ago. All the blowdowns have been taken out. It’s a great trail now - especially since hardly anyone uses it. After you cross over into Lily Basin it’s nonstop views to the Angry Mountain Trail JCT, and from there just a short jog over to the Heart Lake JCT. Heart Lake is a long drop down from the trail, much more than we planned. It’s also incredibly bug-infested. I was coated with flies trying to filter water. Because of this we opted to camp above the lake, where the bugs were just slightly better. After the flies died down the mosquitoes were out in force. Finally, just before dusk, all the bugs went to bed. Day 2: off at 8 am and heading around the Heart Lake basin. The scenery improves steadily with big views of the Goat Rocks and eventually, Jordan Basin and the Goat Ridge. There are two snowfields to cross and one is a bit treacherous so I recommend microspikes and/or a pole. At the Hawkeye Point use trail JCT we dropped our packs and hoofed it up to the top. Spectactular scenery and well worth the side trip. Amazing view of Old Snowy and Goat Lake, as well as Mt. Rainier. The haze was really bad on this trip and Mt. Adams was entirely obscured for most of the trip, but the scenery was still terrific. We saw a large herd of goats on a glacier above Goat Lake. After a quick lunch we worked our way down and then around to Goat Lake, great place for a cold foot soak and mercifully bug-free. The camping here is wide open and plentiful and one of the better camping areas on this trip. And from here, we hiked down to Alpine, just above Snowgrass, for fresh water, lots of camping, lots of people, and lots more flies. Somewhat better than Heart Lake but we still wore head nets all evening. Day 3: our ‘biggest day’, a planned 7.5 mi up to Old Snowy on the PCT hiker route, then down to Packwood saddle where we planned to camp for the night. The trail is great but the heat was tremendous, so we were glad we started early. Shemma is a strong hiker and we were up to Old Snowy by 10 am. We were so early we decided to tack on the side trip of an ascent up Old Snowy itself. Shemma loved making his first ‘ascent’ and reveled in the views of Mt. Gilbert and Ives Peak. From there we worked our way down to the PCT and then along the Knife Edge, then more very hot up and down before reaching Elk Pass and the turnoff for the PCT. We saw a large herd of goats below Mt. Gilbert and a couple loners below Packwood Glacier. After a rest on the snowfield near Elk Pass, we tackled the last mile and a half descent into Packwood Saddle, our planned stop for the night. En route we were overtaken by several groups rerouting off the PCT due to the Miriam Fire near White Pass, as well as those concerned about the new Clear Fork Fire southwest of there (and closer to Coyote Ridge). Because of this a large group of hikers congregated at Packwood Saddle making alternate plans. Most elected to descend Lake Creek Trail to Packwood Lake rather than linger on the ridge overnight. We examined our options and none were good. Asking Shemma to hike another 6 steep downhill miles that late in the afternoon was tough but he’s a great sport, and we headed downhill, determined not to camp in the dark, overgrown forest. The trail is pretty poorly maintained at the top. There are tons of down trees, trail hard to find at times. It’s a steep descent. All in all, pretty darn exhausting. By the end we were spent. We were about to just throw our tent up in any old flat spot we could find in the forest when we ran into two guys who told us the Lake was just five minutes away. Invigorated, we soldiered on and quickly found the lake and a glorious, bug free campsite. We took a quick swim, cooked up some grub, and collapsed into a great sleep after a truly epic day of 14 miles with 2000 ft of up and 5000 ft of down. Shemma is a stud! Day 4: We slept in today and enjoyed the last day of our unexpectedly short trip. We opted to head out rather than spend another day camped at Packwood Lake but that would have been a lot of fun, as well. The lake is much bigger, much more beautiful, and much more peaceful/less populated than I knew. Have to come back some time. The hike to Packwood dam is quick and easy. From the dam to the road is not quite the flat forest amble we anticipated - there are some significant ups and downs along the way - but all in all we made great time. We were happy to see the car and celebrate with pizza and root beer in town. Really fantastic journey, would do it again in a heartbeat but would like to spend the planned third night up on Coyote Ridge and fourth night at Lost Lake, but will have to be some other time. This is a wonderful trip.	Aug 06, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-10.2399995815
Burroughs Mountain	Matt Kite	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	The trail is in great shape, from the Sunrise parking lot all the way to Third Burroughs. Horseflies were persistent. No snow on the trail. Too many people on the first part of the hike (we thought we'd get lucky going on a Monday), but after Frozen Lake, we saw more marmots than hikers. Spectacular scenery. The final push to Third Burroughs is tough, but the payoff is a mind-boggling view of Mt. Rainier. We had the place to ourselves and got there just in time for the golden hour. Wow.     As usual, my son took photos and I shot video (see below).	Aug 06, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-07.1161285290
Mount St. Helens - Monitor Ridge	Amylwierenga	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	The recent trip reports are very helpful, I particularly liked the one from July 28 (the breakdown of the hike was spot on). To avoid repetition, I will just add a few observations from our hike today. I had prepared myself for going up, read about the forest, the boulders, and the ash. I knew it was going to be hard, and I was actually feeling good the whole way up (note that we took a lot of breaks). Though the ash was a bit scary - I felt like I could easily fall (poles helped). Anyway, my point is that what I did not expect, was how tough it would be to climb down. I always think of the hard part as climbing up, and I don’t usually have trouble going down. But 4,500 vertical feet is no joke! Even with poles, it was slow going and my knees hurt the whole way, and will hurt the next few days. Take it slow. We took 5.5 hours going up and 4.5 going down. Slow and steady! We enjoyed the views, and there’s nothing quite like looking into the crater from the rim! We left around 5am, and avoided the sun for several hours as we were in the shade of the mountain ridge. The breeze felt amazing, so we were not bothered by heat or even bugs the whole day. It was a great hike, and I highly recommend doing at least once! (Though not as your first hike ever, like one girl we met on the mountain!) You can do it!

Cutthroat Lake	weinbers	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Trail is open!  Recently closed due to proximity to a wildfire but thankfully through the dedicated work of the firefighters had quickly been contained.  We had just returned from a camping trip in Glacier NP in Montana but had to make a stop on the way home to enjoy the North Cascades.  We hiked with the two kiddos (2 & 1/2 years old + 8 months).  First time hiker on this trail, but long time listener to the trip reports from the WTA (whoop, whoop!)  Our older one started out fast and made it just to the lake before bonking.  He was heavy load on the way back...why are kids heavier when they are sleeping?  Started out warm but with a nice breeze, way back was caliente with heavy dosing of the H20 required.  Super doable hike with the kids.  Some refreshing water crossings throw in.  Nice stop at the lake for lunch with endorphin-stimulating views of the mountains.  Do it!

Rattlesnake Ledge	ChloeL	Minor obstacles posing few problems	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Hiked here with my dog today for the first time today! We made it up within an hour and back down in about 50min as the traffic was of lower volume on the way down. For a weekday the trail was pretty busy, but I can't imagine how busy it is on the weekends.  If you are a fellow dog owner looking to take your dog(s) on this trail, be aware that while the trail is dog friendly, many people let their dogs off-leash on this trail. While I did my best to keep my dog in a controlled state while other dogs passed, there were many occurrences where off leash dogs would get up in my dogs personal space or would express aggressive behavior, which made him pretty ticked off. Unfortunately, there happened to be one off-leash dog today that came after my dog after we had passed them and tried to nip at my dogs back legs. Certain parts of the trail are pretty thin, especially while climbing towards the top. The trail is very rocky in certain parts as well and some of the rocks are too smooth to step on and/or are loose. There are some big steps involved with these rocks as well. If you are older or have joint problems, it would be best to use trekking poles. Just make sure to pace yourself as best as possible, don't waste all your energy at the start. It's a long way up. The view at the top is gorgeous, but be careful on the rocks, some are smooth and you could easily slip on them if you are not paying attention. For the time of the year being, the top was pretty packed and it was hard to find somewhere to sit without being in the way of someones photo. By all means, I'll definitely be doing this hike again with friends. 	Aug 06, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-06.1802148272
Mirror and Cottonwood Lakes	AlBuck	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Beautiful morning for hike up to Mirror Lake with my dog Dusty. Very nice view of Silver Peak and both Mirror Lake and Cottonwood Lake. Only 1 car at trailhead when I arrived around 7am. Did not run into any hikers going up or coming down. No one camping at Cottonwood Lake and only saw 1 tent at Mirror Lake. As the previous posts have indicated, hike to end of Mirror Lake to get fabulous pictures of Mirror Lake and Silver Peak. The only hard part of the hike was the 1  part going the .5 miles up the road to the trail that forks into the woods (and really wasn’t that difficult). Very easy hike to do.

Boardman Lake	Kelleth	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	The road is pretty rough and full of potholes. It took us almost half an hour to go the 5 miles to the trailhead in our small car. We arrived at the trailhead around 8:15 am and arrived at Boardman lake before 9 am. The trail was well reasonably good, the weather was perfect, and the lake was beautiful and there were only four other people there on a Monday morning.

Gothic Basin	onka	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	LOST AND FOUND: I'm searching for a pair of red adjustable trekking poles and an "eVent" brand compression sack with clothes inside that would have been lost on August 5th. I believe the trekking poles were left near the side of the road across from the trailhead/the gate saying to keep the area clear. The compression sack was most likely left at my campsite. To get to my campsite you would turn left at the end of the hike (towards Weeden Lake) rather than right, towards Foggy Lake. The campsite also had a tiny campfire area. If you found either of these items please please PLEASE email me at afleming@pugetsound.edu I will provide full compensation for any shipping costs, etc. and I might even send you some GIANT cookies!! I really need these items and although they don't have high retail value I use all of them frequently. Thanks!!

Pete Lake	SARgeek	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	     Decided to do an overnight hike to Pete Lake with my son.  We arrived at the trailhead around 0700 to a full parking lot.  After finding a place to park, we headed up the trail, or as we started referring to it as, "Mosquito Alley".  The bugs were thick, but as long as you kept moving they weren't too bad.  Stop, and they would use you as a nest! The trail was in great condition, and you could tell a work crew had been there recently. We passed a few people with dogs, none on leashes so if you have a dog, just be aware there are others on the trail.  We also were passed by about five different horse groups so beware of processed grain and grass on the trail ;-)  as it is a multi-use trail.       At the lake, camping spots were a premium, most having been claimed the day before (It's always busy on weekends so it wasn't any surprise to me). We found one spot on top of the rock next to the trail that leads to the far end of the lake and set up camp then headed down to Lemah creek to cool off.      Around 4 or 5 (maybe later) a decent thunder storm came over and entertained us all followed by some light rain.  It was awesome to hear the rain on the tent, but it didn't really last that long. Their was a forest ranger in the area doing some trial pruning and maintenance, she was very informative and had the camping areas looking great NOTE:  Please, if you pack it in, pack it out, there were shoes, sweatshirts, tissues, water bottles old batteries, TP etc. here and there and the ranger had a half full bag in tow.      In the morning, we packed up and hiked back out through mosquito alley and to the parking lot. All in all, it was a good trip and I got to spend some quality time with my kid.	Aug 06, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-06.1133432263
Bench and Snow Lakes	Ken Giesbers	Obstacles on trail:	    Overgrown in places.	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were terrible	I’ve been wanting to see the east side of the Tatoosh Range, and the Bench/Snow Lake trail offered a way to get there. I decided to make Foss Peak my goal for a day hike. After a 1 mile roller coaster of a trail, I scoped out the two campsite at Snow Lake. Both were empty on this Monday morning. The lake was pristine. I could see fish swimming beneath the surface and occasionally breaking the surface of the lake. Gorgeous. The trail is in great shape. After the end of the maintained trail, I started making my way across the huge talus field, toward a chute leading up to an obvious draw. I heard what sounded like an airplane, which persisted longer than an airplane noise would. I realized that I was hearing a strong flow of water under the talus, echoing under the rocks. Very nice. I continued up the steep chute, which had a grade of over 45% near the top, to an elevation of 5400 feet. A snowmelt stream, and shade, made it my choice for lunch or a snack on the way down. From the top of the draw, I could see another draw and my destination ridge. Several patches of snow lingered along the way. At the ridge (6100’), I started walking north, looking for a boot trail that follows the ridge. I saw a dropoff on the right, and thick trees on the left. I just got scratched up trying to go between them. Finally, I figured out to drop down on the left briefly, then climb up to the ridge again. Most of the ridge walk was along the top after that. There was a rock scramble that tested me, but I ended up making it all the way to the summit of Foss Peak, 6524’. From there I had an unobstructed view of Mt. Rainier, and the view I wanted of the western Tatoosh Range all the way to The Castle (which I had hiked to already from the west). Looking south, Unicorn Peak and West Unicorn Peak were mostly silhouetted. I had a brief snack at the summit, then started down, much faster now that I knew the route. I saw evidence of mountain goats, but saw nothing larger than a marmot. The steep chute was no longer in the shade, but the cold water still made a decent spot for a snack. I just had to be alert for any rockfall.  Note: The rocks and boulders are loose and shifty on the entire talus slope. If you take this off-trail route, make sure each foot placement is stable. Do not expect to make good time. Bugs had been mild for the entire hike. But by the time I got back to Snow Lake, they were fierce. The black flies were landing on me in multiples. I hustled back along the trail, pausing only to pick and eat a few berries, then quickly swat the flies on my legs. The huckleberries and blueberries are just beginning to ripen; most are still tart. #watrailsday	Aug 06, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-11.6387851842
Sheep Lake to Sourdough Gap	CiscoKitty	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	Got an early start because we camped out at Lodgepole Campground. Highly recommend. No fancy amenities. Small campground along the American River and close to this hike.  The hike starts out parallel to 410. It's sure different hiking along the road you were on. Get a perspective from both views. This first part it totally exposed with little to no shade.  Lots of wildflowers out but quickly fading in the heat. You could tell there were forest fires with the smoke in the air and haze on the skyline.  The dog and I turned a corner on the trail that opened up after the wooded area only to be serenaded by a pack of coyotes. It was early in the morning and we were by ourselves. Needless to say the hair on my arms was standing up. I made sure my whistle was close, bear spray within reaching distance plus got my poles off my pack. I was actually surprised my dog never responded. He's a Coonhound and they like to bay,  but he just listened. We continued on after being frozen and made it to the lake. Beautiful lake. Hoyt got a drink and we check out the other side and almost all the way around the lake. I still wanted to head up to Sourdough gap and to beat the heat so we needed to keep going forward. Wildflowers were out but on their way out and I saw lots of fish jumping in the lake.  The trail up to the top is dry and dusty with flowers. Some nice views. Some rocky sections too. Some of the views surprised me that you could see Hwy 410.  Once up top on the gap you get an excellent view of Sheep Lake. If you zoom in on your camera or binoculars you will see Hwy 410 and the parking lot. I could even tell where my truck was parked. Turn to leave that view only to see another vast view on the backside. This is where you head to the park boundary or onto the PCT. We went to the park and got an amazing view of Rainier and Crystal Lakes. It is possible to do a thru hike with this hike and Crystal. Something I plan on doing but I won't be able to bring the dog. A quick lunch, photos and back down to the lake.  There were so many more people at the lake on our return. People fishing, out on their floaties and dogs swimming. Hoyt got to run and swim with two other dogs. I was relieved about this because the day had gotten hot and he needed to cool off. Everyone at the lake was so nice and enjoying themselves. Everyone, including the dogs, was well behaved too. It's kind of hard to be upset when you're in such a beautiful spot.  After a good time we left the lake and headed to the truck. No signs or sounds of the coyotes. The forested shady area is a relief when it is hot out because much of this trail is exposed. When we got back to the side of the trail that parallels 410 the sun had definitely heated up and this is where my big mistake was made. I never thought that the dirt trail would get so hot that my dog was running to find shade. It was too hot for his paws. He has booties but I didn't bring them. He has worn them in very rocky areas but the thought that the dirt would be too hot escaped me.  Lessoned learned. I made sure that we took no time at all lollygagging around and we ran from shade spot to the next or at least a spot on the side of the trail that had grass he could step in. I felt so bad. Here I had shoes to protect my feet from the scorching dirt but he didn't. Protect your four legged kids too.  I highly recommend this hike, especially if you have a dog, and we will be coming back again. 	Aug 06, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-11.0615565491
Naches Peak	davidhikes	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Started at 12:30 today starting clock wise. Finished at around 5 pm after we took a dip in the pond. Wildflowers are definitely at their peak and it’s nice to see so many bees with their declining population and all. Bugs were not too bad with the exception of the black flies being on you if you stay still. Saw many people with their little kids. Will do this again as it an easy hike.

Plain View	C P	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Found 2 short trails you just had to know about.  Off Chumstick Highway between Leavenworth and Plain between miles 12 and 13 at the high point, trails lead both East and West up the ridge.   Park at the Fire Danger sign (Extreme right now).  Both trails lead to fine views down to Plain and out to many mountains but for smoke from the Cougar Creek fire.  This little ridge is higher than it seems.   Trail to the East hits ancient road on the ridge crest,  right to a private cabin signed "Our Mountain", and it sure feels that way.  Left stays on the crest then drops toward Plain. Trail West from the Highway climbs to  awesome valley views.  I reached the high point, trail seemed to continue- I did not.   Just wanted you guys to know about these close-in little trails.  Enjoy!

Old Snowy Mountain - Elk Pass	HusbandWifePuppy	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Intermittent snow - not hard to cross	Ran up to Old Snowy and an early start was our ticket to an enjoyable day! Started at 6;30am and got up to the top by 9. By the time we made back to the car at 11, the bugs just started to come out and weather started getting super hot! Go early!  Camped at Chamber Lake CG the night before; great spot!	Aug 06, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-10.8269792516
Mount Catherine	JwadeS	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Definitely a good quick strength hike. Starts off climbing and only breaks a couple times. The view was not as majestic as I expected, there are some trees at the top that make it difficult for a full view. For this area I would recommend hitting the Silver Peak trail if you want a full unobstructed view. The road getting up was fine but dry so be wary of your speed.

Mount Pilchuck	CarolPow	Minor obstacles posing few problems	Road rough but passable	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	Arrived TH around 11:30, finished at 4:30 with a 30 minute enjoyable moment at the lookout.  The drive up was pretty bad, potholes, small rocks, bumpy road, you name it. Take it slow or else you could bottom out and puncture something in your engine and have a leak. Went in a pretty high clearance SUV, still hit some potholes despite slow navigation. For the hike, there were quite a lot of bugs. The deet did keep them from biting, but sometimes they buzz around you. I was quite surprised you're hiking alongside rock fields for half of it, and half of it being forested. You're immediately awarded with amazing views at the 3rd rock field. So remember to wear boots or have poles , to watch where you're going, and have fun navigating different sized rocks.  The view was definitely rewarding, but don't hesitate to stop along the way if you find a nice rock to lay against or sit. 	Aug 06, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-06.4434025468
Rattlesnake Ledge	ChrisAnne8	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	We did a sunrise hike.  Started at 415am.  We only hiked to Rattlesnake Ledge.  1.9 miles up and down.  We enjoyed the sunrise and mimosas!! Weather was awesome and scenary was beautiful.  Easy hike and trail was great.  It is rocky and has obstacles but wear a headlamp until you can see and its fine.  	Aug 06, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-06.0971930007
Hegg-Benson Trail	JohnDavidWSU	Minor obstacles posing few problems	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Today, I set out to locate and scout the beginning of the Old Sauk Mountain Trail, which begins at the end of the 0.6 mile Hegg-Benson Trail.  I have been curious about the original route up Sauk for a long time, so the fact that it still exists is exciting.  Thanks to the hard volunteer work that WTA trip reporter "C P" has done on this trail, I am determined to hike it this season.  I have been searching everywhere for an old Green Trails or topo map that shows this route, but nothing that I have looked at dating back to the 70's shows it.  I also asked rangers about it at the Sedro-Woolley office, but they didn't even know of its existence.  Barr Creek is the outlet of Sauk Lake, so I'm guessing the route more or less follows the creek, gaining 5000+ feet in the process.  When I attempt this entire hike, I will record the GPS track and upload it here. Since I was short on time today, I took a brief walk to Barr Creek Falls, and then continued to where the Hegg-Benson trail ends and the Old Sauk Mountain Trail begins at around 0.6 miles.  The first quarter mile of trail is overgrown to the creek viewpoint, but is in good condition beyond, and it begins climbing steadily.  On my way back down the trail, I ran into a large black bear who sprinted across the trail and down to Barr Creek.  Luckily I wasn't on his menu this time--he just seemed thirsty. Based on previous trip reports, I know that "C P" cleared the Old Sauk Mountain Trail to around 3300' several months ago, but beyond that, the condition is unknown.  If anybody has successfully made it all the way up from the valley floor and has a GPS route or can share with us where the old trail connects with the current Sauk Mountain Trail, it would be appreciated!

East Lake Sammamish Trail	karnage	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Took the kids for a nature stroll today.  We parked in the back corner of the lot and headed out on the trail going east.  We meandered to the clearing where there were some treea that looked like and old orchard.  To the left there was a nice green shaded trail that followed Issaquah creek.  We turned around at the open field to head back toward the water for some splashing.  There are lots of ripe blackberries, but don't eat the ones near the beach since they have just sprayed. They did put signs up telling you not to eat them.  We walked just under two miles. #hikeathon	Aug 06, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-06.0640411688
Mount Spokane State Park - Trail 130	cassb08	Minor obstacles posing few problems	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	I recently did my first WTA work party at Mount Spokane State Park Trail 130. The condition of this trail is being actively worked on. The trail is mostly clear for foot traffic but our group was working towards widening the path with tread work by removing grass and brush, installing drain dips and clearing branches with pruning poles to help make the corridor open for taller trail users (i.e. horseback and bike riders). The path is not completely done and work on this trail will continue over the next month. There were scattered wildflowers blooming. Ripened huckleberries along side the path and the views at the open clearing were beautiful but smoky. Nice tree shade throughout most of the hike. Elevation change is gradual. Bees and gnats were bothersome.	Aug 06, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-12.3135477225
Mount Margaret	knockout	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Absolutely amazing trail. Never had so much bang for my buck. Views nearly the entire time of St. Helens and spirit lake. The skies were a bit hazy with the smoke, but could still see Adams and Rainier in the distance. Started at parking lot and hiked to Bear Camp. The water source (melting snow above) was still flowing, but halted when the sun when down. Setup camp and then hiked to Margaret as the sun went down. Stunning views and awesome to watch the rocks becoming painted with reds as the sun said goodnight. WTA trail directions were very important as the signage on the trail is lacking for Bear Camp/Margaret, so be sure to screen shot them. They were very helpful, along with travelers on the trail. Of course no tree cover, so sun protection is a must. The wildflowers were still abundant and beautiful. Snacked on many salmon berries along the way. Mammal scat was abundant just off the trail leading away from Bear Camp to the lower view point of the lake. Found some prints outside of camp in the morning on our way out. Easily one of the best hikes I’ve done in terms of stunning views and landscape.	Aug 06, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-08.2274306378
Henskin Lake	Outdoor Girl Too	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	We headed out of the Crystal Mountain Ski Resort parking lot and took the trail just behind the chapel to Henskin Lake. Then we hooked into the Crystal Mountain Trail and made our way to the top of the gondola. In all we hiked 6 miles and climbed 2,000 feet to the top. Bugs were worse along the lake, but not too bad otherwise. Wild flowers were beautiful at the final ascent. One plus to this hike is the option of riding the gondola down to save your knees!

Lake 22	erinjill45	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	I arrived at the parking lot at 8 am. There were only a handful of cars. My two friends and I got to the lake in 1 hour and 18 minutes. There were 10 other people when we go to the lake. We ended up walking around the lake. My friend even ran up to the snow and saw an ice cave with a lot of water melting. We ate some blueberries along the way which was delicious. After hanging out at the lake, we headed back to the parking lot around 11:30 am. The lake was gorgeous that day. I wore dry fit and used my hiking poles. There were some water creeks to pass, but my friends had regular shoes and it was manageable. The hike is easy to moderate overall. 	Aug 06, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-08.7378366515
West Defiance - Putrid Pete's Peak	Bruce	Trail difficult/impossible to navigate:	    Trees down across trail,	    Mud/Rock slide or washout.	Road suitable for all vehicles	We did a terrific loop hike that combined Putrid Pete's Peak, a ridge traverse, Mt. Defiance, and Mason Lake. We started and ended at the Ira Spring trailhead, hiking 9.3 miles with a total elevation gain of 3900'.  PPP was challenging as always, but the trail seemed more distinct than when I did it 3 years ago. We also enjoyed it more knowing that we wouldn't have to come down the same way. At the top we found the trail register and some rocks flat enough to perch on while we enjoyed a much-needed snack. To get from PPP to the Mt. Defiance trail, you follow the ridge line for about 1 mile. The first part of this was the most challenging, because the easiest path seemed to be a few dozen feet below and to the south of the ridge, yet we had to step carefully across some big rocks on a steep slope. It seemed reasonably safe as long as we took our time. After what felt like an hour but may have been less, we got back on the ridge and followed a more reasonable trail the rest of the way to Defiance. Once the ridge ended as it blended into Mt. Defiance, our GPS apps said we were very near the Mt. Defiance trail, but a little south (downhill) of that trail. They didn't seem to connect exactly, so when our apps said we were just below the spur trail up to the top of Defiance, we started climbing left toward it on the Defiance ridge. After a couple of minutes, we met the Mt. Defiance trail and the way to the summit became much more obvious.  It's well worth the half-mile detour (after all, isn't all hiking a detour?) to the top of Defiance. The trail is steep but it was a relief to be on a clear dirt trail after everything we'd done to get there. And there were lots of wildflowers. And the views from the top of Defiance, looking down to Kulla Kulla Lake, Mason Lake, and Little Mason Lake, were spectacular. The summit was also where we encountered the first other hikers of the day. After a lengthy break for photos, lunch, and general rejuvenation, we headed down the spur trail and left toward Mason Lake. This trail was excellent, offering a dessert of huckleberries before reaching a picturesque entry to Mason Lake. There were surprisingly few people there but one was sporting a 2018 Hike-a-Thon t-shirt. The lake was the perfect temperature for a swim, which made us significantly less putrid. The walk back down to the trailhead was enhanced by a few perfectly ripe blackberries. The links below are to our GPS track and some additional photos.

Mount Townsend - Silver Lakes Traverse	Eric LugSoul	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	I hiked a variation of this route that's 2 miles shorter, and makes a loop that avoids having to climb Mt. Townsend twice.  It's the route described in Trail 32 of Douglas Lorain's "Olympic National Park and Vicinity".  The drive in was rather long, but the roads were in good condition.  I parked at Tubal Cain trailhead, where there were only a few other cars.  The ascent up the Little Quilcene Trail to Dirty Face Ridge was steep, but the trail was in good shape with no blowdowns, and many fine views of the mountains to the west.  I encountered only two other hikers on that stretch.  I took a left at the unmarked junction with the trail leading to the north summit of Mt Townsend, which was easy to follow and not too steep.  The views from the north summit were spectacular, and no other hikers were there.  The Salish Sea spread out to the north and east, and ridge after ridge of mountains to the west and south.  The air was a bit hazy, but it was clear enough to pick out Port Angeles, Victoria, Port Townsend, the San Juans,  and numerous other islands.  The weather was fine, with little wind.  The only negative was the swarms of flies, which seemed to grow more numerous as I ascended.  I saw very few mosquitoes. From there it was an easy walk to the south summit, where I saw a few other hikers.  Again, the views were spectacular.  I descended the trail on the south ridge, which was braided into multiple ruts from heavy use.  A few switchbacks down took me to the junction for the Silver Lake Trail, which was in good shape and clear of blowdowns all the way to Silver Lake.  Silver Lake is a lovely spot.  I circled it and saw nobody camped there, and just a few other hikers.  I saw no trash, but I did notice a geocache in a tupperware container tucked under a boulder.  I believe these are prohibited in wilderness areas, but I decided to leave it there. From Silver Lake, I dropped .6 miles back down the trail to the unsigned junction with Silver Lake Way.  The junction is marked with a few orange plastic ribbons.  The trail descends Silver Creek, and is quite steep and rough in places, but not difficult to follow.  It appears that someone's maintaining it, because it was clear of blowdowns, and brush had been cut back in places. In a couple of miles, the trail reaches gravel Forest Road 2870, and it's a mile along the road back to the Tubal Cain trailhead.  My GPS showed a total mileage of 12.

Lake Ann (Mount Baker Highway)	IamJetBlack	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Intermittent snow - not hard to cross	My wife and I got the the trailhead about 8:30am and there were about 7-8 cars in the lot. Unlike other trails off the Mt Baker Highway this trail provides unique views of the south side of the Shuksan Arm along the trail and once at Lake Ann incredible views of the Curtis Glaciers. Lake Ann is really the sidenote on this hike - its the west/south side of Shuksan and the east side of Mt Baker that makes this hike worth the view. Although the lake did have that pink snow algae covering the top which was cool. The hike is sun exposed a good part of the way so bring plenty of water and if you can start around 7-9am you'll be in the shade the majority of the way there and unless you hike back in the evening there is most likely no way to avoid the full exposure on the way back. Its a different hike than most in the Baker area because of the terrain and scenery - I don't know of another trail that offers a view of this side of Shuksan. Wildflowers were blooming and the biting flies were getting us pretty good. The trail got a little crowded on our way back around 12-1 and the lot was full. A few snow patches to cross but spikes are not necessary at the point. I will definitely come back for a weekday overnighter - plenty of campsites around the lake. 	Aug 06, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-08.6553497237
Oyster Dome	Wanderlustering WA with Dogs	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	The Oyster Dome trail from Samish Overlook is currently CLOSED for logging! From the parking lot at Samish Overlook, you can hike the first part of the trail to where it meets the trail down to the Chuckanuts and head down to the Chuckanuts but you cannot hike further down the Oyster Dome trail to get to the dome itself or meet up with the Lily Lake or Lizard Lake trails from there. The trail should reopen soon. I am scared to find out what it will look like after logging as this place has always been a mini paradise but I will go again shortly to have a look.

Burroughs Mountain	BillyWan	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	This was our second trip to Third Burroughs. This last Monday as we drove up to Sunrise we passed the trailhead for Summerland and noted that the parking area was about half full. I always pay attention given that it is a hike we like. There were plenty of spaces at Sunrise and we headed up the trail at 8:30 am. The weather was already getting warm but a cool breeze helped as we ascended Burroughs One and Two. We saw marmots, Cascade golden-mantled ground squirrels and one pika. The ground squirrels are ubiquitous and bold at the Burroughs summits. We headed on from Burroughs Two to Three and arrived at the summit after 2-1/2 hours of hiking. We spent about an hour on top having lunch and taking photos and then headed down. We had a serendipitous trail moment as we hiked across the saddle to ascend Burroughs Two. We were surprised to encounter my wife’s sister who was descending Burroughs Two. We invited her to hike with us to Burroughs Three and she turned around and hiked back up Two to join us. So, she had a bigger day than we did. Many hikers on the trail asked about Burroughs Three. How much further? Is it worth it? Well, yes, it’s worth it if you have gas in the tank. It adds 3 miles additional to the round-trip mileage (think 6 miles RT for Two and 9 miles RT for Three). And you add 1,155 more cumulative elevation gain to your trip (think 1,345 ft for Two and approx. 2,500 ft for Three). Many hikers look at Three from Two and wonder. Well you lose about 375 feet in elevation down to the saddle between them and then gain 780 feet to the summit of Three and then have to descend and hike back up to Two. The summit of Three is rockier and the views even more dramatic. Just do it! Be advised, the WTA trip description is misleading. It would be good if stats for both summits were described. This is an exposed hike and will take it out of you on a hot day. Fortunately, we had a light breeze on the way up and increasing cloud cover on the way down. The only negatives were the presence of some gigantic black flies at the summit and hazy skies. My advice is to go during the week and go early. There were hordes of people coming up as we left and the Sunrise parking lot was overflowing (on a Monday). I took two virtual reality spherical panoramic photos at the summit of Three. They provide a cool immersive experience of the views, so check them out. Here are the links to view them in a pano viewer at 360cities.net.

Walker Preserve	Elizabeth “Ducky”	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	I happened to stumble across this trail on the Hike Finder portion of the WTA website. I had no clue this little trail existed, so close to work and home! The parking lot holds about 4 cars, and it located right on the corner of 171 and 2nd ave SW. The trail started a little bit down the street, you'll see the "Walker Creek Preserve" sign looking north on 2nd ave. The trail starts between two homes and crosses over a bridge onto Walker Creek. Right after the bridge to the right you see the old oil tanker railroad car. It looks so out of place with no railroad near by. We deicided to do the Miller Creek loop which warns you that there is elevation change. This little loop is very steep at the start, and being as dry as it is, it's a little nerve racking, but there are some nice fence posts to help you brace yourself as you go down. There are nettles on this trail, so if you do go on it be aware, and make sure you know what they look like. The Miller Creek Loop follows, you guessed it, Miller Creek. The trail has some elevation gain after about 1/3 of a mile on this loop the trail. The trail meets up with the Miller Creek Loop Trail which you can either continue on, or head East back on the main trail. A nice quiet trail, which makes you feel like your miles away from all the city hustle and bustle, minus the sound of the airplanes taking off at SeaTac.

Chain Lakes Loop	Jordan Soltman	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Intermittent snow - not hard to cross	We had hiked the entire loop last week and decided that a night on the lakes was worth while. Hiked in from Ptarmagin and set up camp on Hayes lake. It was... surprisingly busy at the lake. Most campsites were full which was shocking for a Monday.  The snow field crossing are pretty minor and much, much smaller than last week. I would give it another week before you can make the trek snow free.  We’ve been longing for blueberries where are finally starting to show up (still green pretty much everywhere), however, if you want a little preview of ripe berries, as well as a gorgeous views, follow the trail towards the Hayes lake campsites, and keep going around the lake, then continue around Arbuthnot lake a little ways till you find the trail that goes over the ridge. We actually found ripe blueberries back there which was a pleasant surprise and the view doesn’t dissapoint. The trail around the lake seems like it ends at times but keep pushing through and you’ll get there.	Aug 06, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-07.4496123998
Elk Mountain	Whidbey Walker	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	  This hike began at Obstruction Point and headed east on the Grand Ridge Trail towards Maiden Peak.  It was a warm Monday with a great deal of Haze in the sky when we arrived at Obstruction Point about 10:00 a.m.  Some delay with road construction along the 5 mile road to the Heart of the Hills entrance.  Maybe 15 minutes each way.  My guess is this will last at least through August.  I marked "Road rough but passable" for the Obstruction Point Road drive mostly because there are a few places along the 8 miles that are not for the faint hearted.  The flower show is mostly over but some color is hanging on these dry and barren slopes.  Some snow fields still remain to be seen but the entire trail is snow free.  A nice breeze kept the bugs away and made for a very good hiking temperature.   We took a few extra minutes and scrambled up Elk Mountain (6,674') and enjoyed the views north to the strait, Port Angeles, Mount Angeles, Dungeness Spit, and of course Whidbey Island to the NE.  One of the great Olympic Day Hikes.  (My opinion of course.)      	Aug 06, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-07.7827214932
Sauk Mountain	Retired!	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Intermittent snow - not hard to cross	Another 5 star hike!  The biggest drawback is that its pretty short - just a little over 4 miles up and back, about 2 hours total hiking time at a moderate pace.  But then again, the views are nonstop and remarkable! A second potential drawback is for those prone to experience vertigo or anxiety about heights.  The trail, often narrow, winds its way via 26 switchbacks up a steep exposed hillside.  Based upon my experience with other hikers that experience vertigo along narrow, steep hillsides, this may be a tough trail for them. The good news is that the trail itself is never steep which works for my arthritic knees especially on the way down.  With the help of hiking sticks, the descent was relatively painless. Although I hiked at the heat of the day in mid-afternoon on a hot day, given the moderate elevation gain, heat was never an issue.  Just bring plenty of water.  I carried three and used two liters  Even though it was a Monday, there were still a number of hiking parties on the trail and the parking lot was about three quarters full when I arrived at 3 pm.  Bugs were manageable with 40% Deet.  The road was actually very good with occasional potholes except for one rough 30' section just before you reach the trailhead, but that stretch is passable with care.  	Aug 06, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-07.6339402679

Had my 3 year old in the pack and overall it was an awesome hike! On the way up I only encountered two other hikers, but on the way down the trail was definitely busier and was glad to have enjoyed the summit without the crowd. Trail was in amazing condition! It gets steep once you meet up with the upper trailhead but a great reward once at the summit. 	Aug 06, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-06.8292627326

Gothic Basin	jjtmao	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Intermittent snow - not hard to cross	This hike is amazing, definitely the best I've done while living in Seattle. We got to the trailhead at 9am on a Sunday and had to park about .2 mi down the road from the trailhead. There were a few spots closer as we walked by, but definitely plenty of road parking and there might have been some left in the Barlow Point lot as well, we didn't check.  The trail is in great condition and really well constructed, and the variety of scenery throughout the hike is wonderful. There's lots of little mini waterfalls and streams on the way up, and plenty of gorgeous mountain views. When we got to the basin, we scrambled around a bit to get a nice view of Weeden Lake, then went over to Gothic Lake (completely melted), up to Foggy Lake, which still has a fair amount of snow and ice on the surface, then did the scramble up to Del Campo. The scramble was fine without any gear, we just had to cross about 50 yards of snow which was fine with no traction and one pole for each of us, and the scramble up to the peak itself was snow-free. Amazing views from the top, although when we stopped at the top there were a lot of bugs buzzing around. It took us 2 hours, 20 minutes to get up to the basin, we hung out around Gothic Basin for a while, then 2 hours to the summit of Del Campo, 1.5 hours down, and 2 hours back down to the trailhead. One thing that was really important was my friend brought his water filter, which was definitely necessary since we refilled our waters a couple times from the water melting off the ice near Foggy Lake and at one of the waterfalls. We probably drank between 3-5 liters each, maybe more. My Runkeeper app tracked our total trip as 12.77 mi, 10 hours 5 minutes, and 5171 feet of elevation gain. Overall an amazing hike, but be sure to bring plenty of water and enough food/snacks, and use good judgement based on the conditions if you're scrambling up Del Campo.

Lena Lake	a.snowbird	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	We hiked this beautiful trail yesterday. Upon arriving at the trailhead around 1:30, we were able to find parking and hit the restrooms before heading up. There were a lot of people at the trailhead and on the trail. Lots of adorable dogs and kids! The trail is relatively mellow, but watch your step. There are a few spots with loose pebbles/rocks and it can be easy to lose your footing as I did a few times. About 3/4 of the way through the hike, you encounter a gorgeous are of mossy rocks that makes it easy to forget you’re on Earth and not in a fantasy novel. There are two options once you reach the lake: you can stop on the ledge and admire the lake below and eat your lunch there, or you can walk down about a quarter mile or less and you’re at the actual water. We did both, eating lunch on the ledge and then going down to the lake for a swim. The water is crisp and refreshing and we ended up spending quite a bit of time hanging out at the lake. Heading back, we didn’t encounter a single person. So serene and peaceful! The downside was the fire not far away. At times, the smoke was pretty persistent but the wind helped blow it away more. Overall it was great. 3 hr 15 minutes round trip; excluding time at the lake.	Aug 05, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-06.5853124460
Squire Creek Pass via Eight-mile Trail	ravennspirit	Obstacles on trail:	    Trees down across trail,	    Muddy or wet trail,	    Overgrown in places.	Road to the TH is pretty rough. Be prepared for 6.5 miles of potholes and rough, rocky FS road conditions. A low clearance vehicle would be alright (we saw a Prius at the TH) if driving slowly and carefully. Probably the biggest concern would be the rocks that make up a good portion of the road; they are pointy and sharp, just the thing to impale or gouge a tire flat. Limited parking, maybe room for 6-ish vehicles. This trail had been on my "next time" list for a while now, and figured I'd try it out as the kick-off for my Hike-a-Thon trips. While the trail itself is billed as "short" (various sources list it as >6 RT), it certainly "feels" longer, especially on a really hot day. Starting on old rocky roadbed, switchback up moderately steep tread to the sheer vertical cliff face of 3 o'clock Rock. This is a good place to catch your breath and admire the imposing granite, and the views back down the valley before heading up the increasingly steep and rough trail. With some brush obscuring the trail at the base of 3 o'clock Rock, one might be tempted to scramble up and to the left; however instead go right through the brush and the actual trail picks back up a few yards in. Continuing on, the trail gets increasingly steep,and you will find yourself nearly scrambling in places over rocks large and small, spidery masses of tree roots, and 5-6 blow-downs which can be over-undered. This trail will give you a full workout for sure. Several mucky spots just before the pass, and a few small pools and tarns in this area as well. Once at the camping area at the pass, there are gorgeous views of Three Fingers, Mt Bullion and Whitehorse. The landscape here is a study in smooth white granite, wind-sculpted trees, and high peaks in all directions. While my hiking partner rested at the camping area, I continued upwards to Higher Squire, following an increasingly difficult-to-follow bootpath and occasional cairn. Fabulous views from this point as well, but lost/re-found the trail coming down a couple of times as it headed over unmarked expanses of granite. Ripe berries everywhere, mostly thimble and blueberries. Blueberries are ripe but quite tart, almost bitter. A few flowers here and there; pearly everlasting and yarrow lower down, partridge foot, meadow camas, gentian, asters,and some almost-done mountain heather near the summit. On our way out, we stopped on 2060 where Asbestos Creek crosses the road and took a dip in the perfect pool beneath the falls, pure bliss after a hot dusty hike!

Heliotrope Ridge	jayzus	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	Unfortunately, we saw three cars with smashed windows in the parking area. Unsure if someone was trying to steal something or just smashed the windows for no reason. Regardless, make sure you there are no belongings visible in your car. With that being said, it was a beautiful day for this hike. About halfway in the hike, the trail forks. The path to the right is the climbers route, which I've never taken. Our group did not see any signage marking this junction in either direction. On the way down, we accidentally took the climbers route heading back UP instead of down to the parking lot. We immediately noticed something was off and luckily ran into climbers heading down. They set us back on the correct trail down. Thanks! My favorite part of the hike is ascending above the tree line into the meadows and the creeks. The wild flowers were in full bloom here. The glacial creeks were all easy to cross except for one which was gushing. Many hikers were scrambling up and down along the creek to scout out the best point to cross. There wasn't really a great solution. The difficulty in crossing is the mental block of (1) not knowing how slippery the rock is or whether the rock is firmly set or loose, and (2) seeing the gushing water below you. We were able to find one point which you could make a small manageable leap between two rocks. But some hikers opted to find a "calmer" portion of the creek and wade across. The word "calm" here is relative since the entire creek was flowing pretty hard, and no portion was actually "calm". You can ford across with your boots on or you can ford across barefoot, but be careful if you do this. A friend cut her toe. (Luckily, we had a first aid kit). Next time, I would bring hiking poles to assist in crossing. I would also bring an extra pair of sneakers to keep your boots dry and avoid cuts to your feet if you were to cross barefoot. One final note, the water level was higher on the return crossing! (We crossed at the same point, and the water was knee deep the first time and thigh deep on the return). All in all, a great day despite the unexpected adventure and challenge of the creek!

Silver Peak	virginiamj	Trail in good condition	Road recommended for high clearance only	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	The drive to the actual trail head is rough but doable in higher clearance. I have a cross trek and made it, just went really slow. There is a washout around the last tight corner. And some small washouts that aren’t too bad, lots of potholes though!  I followed directions from one the recent trip reports and it was pretty spot on. After the talus field, it’s on your right.  I’ll post a pic of the talus field and then the cairn that marks to turn off ,to start ascending.  I will say this was harder than I thought. But totally worth it. You can see silver peak once you leave the woods and it looked daunting to get up there. Clocked 7.2 miles RT  and took my 4 hours total!  Bugs were TERRIBLE. Forced me to keep moving (maybe this is why it felt hard, no real breaks). Bring bug spray! Thank you to the two guys who gave me some near the top... you’re a life saver.  The views are incredible once at the real summit. You can see in every direction.  Also.. big thank you to a hiker named Peter and his son. A male hiker stopped me near the top to ask if I was alone. Made me feel a little uneasy since it was later in the day and less people on the trail. Peter let me hike down with them. Thanks!! 	Aug 05, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-06.5625140542
Lime Kiln Trail	JoAnne Love	Obstacles on trail:	    Trees down across trail.	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Great hike.  We went to the very end and nice river beach to have a snack.  Then hiked up to the old railroad.  The whole trip was just under 8 miles.  We really hoofed it coming back and boy it's a work out!   I would not recommend for young children.  Fun Hike !

Lake 22	Daninaca	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	What a beautiful hike! Trail has been beautifully maintained so was a pleasure to hike. There was a mix of dirt trail, solid rock and loose rock. For a Sunday afternoon, it wasn't too crowded, it felt like just the right balance! We left the trailhead at 1:30 pm and hiked up to the lake. All along the trail, there were beautiful views to capture your attention. Once we arrived there, we actually continued on to circle the lake. On the far side, we stopped for a while to fish and have a snack. It was pretty secluded, with few people venturing around the lake. At the lake we saw fish (though we didn't catch any), some sort of vole, beautiful wildflowers, lots of crickets and butterflies. We probably spent about an hour at the lake and then headed back down, getting back to the trailhead at 6:45 pm.  A few notes for others venturing to Lake Twenty Two: 1. The mosquitos were pretty bad at the trailhead. The rest of the way was not bad at all, but they were pretty annoying at the start and finish. 2. There were a lot of bags of dog poop and some poop that was not bagged. PLEASE CLEAN UP AFTER YOUR DOGS! 3. We ran into quite a few families with children that were struggling with the difficulty of the trail, the loose rock towards the top was tough for some of the kids. 4. The mileage listed for this hike was right on - 2.7 miles to the lake and then about .5 mile around the lake. It took us about 2 hours to get to the lake. 	Aug 05, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-06.8143160138
Rachel Lake	Bri_Tonks	Obstacles on trail:	    Difficult stream crossing(s),	    Muddy or wet trail.	Road rough but passable	Arrived at the trailhead at 10:30am - parking lot was full with only a handful of cars along the roadside. First half of Rachel Lake is easy enough: some stream crossings and slight bush wacking through multiple meadows. A couple miles in, there's beautiful glacial-melted rocks to the left of the path (also offering a pleasant and welcome pit-stop on the way back down). As others have stated, you'll be working for the payoff at the top half of Rachel Lake trail: steep rock inclines, difficult roots, and disappearing/alternate trails - all easily navigated due to so many people on the trail. Once at the lake, our experience was tainted by a large, roudy group of people shouting in and around the water - if you plan on being boisterous and disrespectful, just go to a public beach. Please respect your fellow hikers, as well as the wildlife and wilderness around you. Unwilling to let them spoil our reward for our efforts, we swam the lake a little further down the right trail. I will caution that in addition to the bugs, there were leeches in the lake; though, I would not let this deter you from enjoying the crystal clear Alpine waters of Rachel Lake!

Eagle Landing Park	Elizabeth “Ducky”	Obstacles on trail:	    .	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	This is a small Burien Park, it used to be private property until about 15 years ago when they turned it into a park. While the stairs to what once was about 50 feet of beach access are now closed to due the hill actively moving it's still a great conditioning hike.  Near the top at the first switchback you can see how much damage people have done cutting the switchback and creating their own trail. Every-time I go 'hike' down I move logs across the area, but everyday someone moves them out of the way again.  Once you get to the other side of the little bench the trail gets very wide from people walking around the tree in now the middle of the trail. Having seen this trail when it first opened it breaks my heart that so many people don't respect nature, or this beautiful neighborhood park. When the city put this park in, they put cloth down on the trail and covered it with gravel, after all the runoff of water and people walking, the cloth is now exposed in a lot of areas and can be slick, even when it's dry. Some of it is ripping and can be a trip hazard so watch your footing for sure.  A few Eagle Scout projects can be seen near the bottom of the trail as they put in amazing check-steps, however lazy people have cut them, and walked next to them causing the 'out-slop' of the trail to get pretty steep.  After about a third of a mile you'll see signs that say area closed due to landslide, and you'll soon come to what once were the stairs, they are now fenced off, but you can see how many people are helping the hill slop off down towards the sound by making their own trail to the stairs.  Please do not use the stairs! This hillside is very steep, unsafe, and very unstable! The city has plans to possibly reopen a portion of the upper stairs, but they will never go to the bottom again due to how much of the hill has washed out under the stairs. This trail is about 3/4 of a mile round trip. And if you're lucky enough you can watch the sunset through the trees at the top of the stairs. There is a small parking lot at the top of the trail that holds maybe 6 cars, be aware though that the signs that say when the park is closed is not correct. it's whenever "True Green" decides to lock the gate. Sometimes in the summer it's locked as early at 7:15 PM, even though it states its open until 8:30-9 PM. 	Aug 05, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-05.6811122957
Lake Valhalla	sherocco	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	I started at the PCT trailhead around 7:30am today and there were only a handful of other cars. The tall grass and brush at the beginning of the trail are about as bad as it gets in terms of overgrowth; otherwise the trail is very well maintained. There was scat on the trail - I'll presume bear given the size and "ploppiness", but I am no scat expert! The mosquitoes were only bad for about a mile surrounding a little pond/meadow before you start really ascending up the mountainside but had dissipated a bit by the time I headed out. I was using 100% DEET and they were still biting me, even through my shirt and pants! The hill grade wasn't too bad... you're basically spreading the gain over the whole distance so most of the ascent isn't too steep. However, if you have bad knees or ankles the trek down can suck simply because you are hiking downhill almost the whole way. The lake itself was beautiful and felt great to hop into. There were a few backpackers getting ready to leave that hopped in as well as some other day hikers. Will definitely keep this little gem in my back pocket as a "return to" destination!

Mount Defiance	RGS7	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	I underestimated this hike big time!  Kicked my butt. Also more beautiful than I expected, so it evened out I suppose. I recommend trekking poles though so your arms can share the burden. Next time I’ll pace myself because I basically sprinted the first two miles. It only got steeper after Mason Lake though (on the way to the summit of Mt. Defiance).  No mud at all, which was nice, since it’s August now   100% beautiful though. Will keep this on my short list. My advice is not to get over-confident about how tough this is!

Easy Pass	Ktfoote	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Easy Pass was a bit smoky today with the wildfires nearby but there were still views. There are no trail markers but the trail was quite obvious, never got lost, and I would characterize it most as an intermediate hike than difficult.  Certainly a worthy wander!

Loowit Trail	eadraper	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Great 2 day fast pack of the Loowit Trail. We entered via the June Lake trailhead. The trail was relatively easy to follow, as we were able to find the trail markers (poles) in all the talus fields. Race markers from the race the day before and the race coming next week, also made the trail very easy to follow. A couple of sections, including the trails going up and down Windy Pass and some the gulley crossings on the SE side of the mountain, required the use of my hands but were passable. The flowers and berries were out in force!	Aug 05, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-07.0726842928
Glacier Vista - Panorama Point	hikingwithmyhubby	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Intermittent snow - not hard to cross	This was our first hike off Paradise, simply because we like trails a little less crowded.  I wasn't expecting a great deal of the trail to be paved, but hey not having to keep my eyes on my feet freed them up to observe the friendly wildlife, including a doe and her fawns, tons of marmots, and chipmunks galore.  It smells wonderfully of valerian for most of the hike.  Beautiful blooms.  Very rewarding for what the hike requires.  Bugs weren't bad, I walked away with 2 bites.  Bring your sunglasses!  My eyes still hurt a day later.  	Aug 05, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-06.2644541455
Heather - Maple Pass Loop	MarmotQueen	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were terrible	Snow free	This trail is open! It was closed briefly for the Cuthroat fire, which has been extinguished. As of 8/5, the trail is not threatened by the nearby Crescent Mountain fire although there was some smokey haze in the air. Other than the smoke, the trail is in great condition and wildflowers are at their peak now! I definitely recommend getting out in the next week or so if you want to catch the wildflowers. We completed the trail in the clockwise direction although generally most traffic was heading counter-clockwise. Overall the trail is in great shape although there are some areas towards the end (or the beginning, if you're going counter-clockwise) that are starting to get overgrown.  The bugs on the ridge were out of control and unfortunately we could not sit down to enjoy a meal at the top. I recommend wearing long layers if you plan to linger at any point. I'm not sure if bug spray would be effective against these mosquitoes. It's a shame because the hike is otherwise gorgeous!

Ebey's Landing	Lukin66	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	We arrived at Ebey's Landing at the leisurely hour of 7AM, and encountered a very stubborn and persistent marine layer. After the scorching hot temperatures of the last week though, it was more than welcome! The trail is in great shape, and there is still some purple vetch blooming. We opted to start on the beach and climb up the bluff past the lagoon for a bit more cardio. We also decided to include the newish Pratt Loop trail on the way back. You don't go past the Ebey House, but it does make for a nice diversion into the scrubby, island pine forest which skirts the landing. Pro Tip: Instead of hitting up Starbucks on the way, stop at Whidbey Island Bagel Factory for some breakfast. Amazing handmade bagels, with a ton of great toppings. I went with the classic lox and it made for a great start to the day.	Aug 05, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-06.8306869670
Surprise and Glacier Lakes	Derek Richards	Minor obstacles posing few problems	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	This hike is a good exercise and gets a little tough in the middle, but the trail is well manicured, though bushes are starting to grow in the trail a bit. Bring bug spray, especially as you get closer to the Lake, but that is true for just about any hike, but this one especially. There are some things from the description that are a little confusing that I would like to clear up. In the driving directions it says take a right after the interpretive site for Iron Goat Trail into the Old Railroad Community of Scenic. If you are expecting anything that looks like an actual community, like a house or buildings that might be confusing, it is the first right, but there is nothing there that would make you think this is an "old community" just a railroad you drive over and then when you take a right you'll start seeing cars with their passes hanging and you'll know you're there. The hike description is a little confusing about how to get to Glacier Lake. When you come to the North End of Surprise Lake there will be a sign that says "Toliet" and points one direction and "Glacier Lake" and it points in what seems like a different direction to the right, to get to Glacier lake follow the trail to the Left which will take you up the last 300 feet of elevation and to the junction with the PCT. Then you'll come to another junction that says "camp" and "Toliet" follow that down pretty steeply and you'll arrive. We got confused and ended up scrambling over some rocks at Surprise Lake thinking it was the trail, we weren't the only one that made that mistake either. So if you were the lady with the 2 dogs in Blue that also was trying to find Glacier Lake, it was that trail to the left. In the end the trail was not very busy on a Sunday we parked at 9am, so that was a pleasant surprise, and the scenery changes enough with the Surprise Creek next to you that it was a good choice. The lakes are beautiful with clear water and we could see quite a few trout in the lake and they would often times jump out of the water completely. This trail is going to be full of ripe berries in 2 weeks and already had a pretty decent amount. Saw some Pika's too at Surprise Lake. Didn't stay at Glacier too long, the bugs were pretty bad and we even had our bug spray.	Aug 05, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-06.8868609882
Ira Spring Trail - Mason Lake	Alana D	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	When we arrived at the trailhead around 9am and the parking lot was almost already full. It is definitely a popular hike. I would classify it as an intermediate hike because the first half up to the lake is almost entirely uphill. It was a nice well-maintained trail, lots of wildflowers along the way and the lake was beautiful. I would recommend sunscreen as 30%+ of the trail is out in the open. There were some bugs at the lake but it wasn't awful. 	Aug 05, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-06.9673509097
Lena Lake	Desisay	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Great day hike! We haven't been on a trail this year due to moving and injury. This was a great first hike. We arrived at 10am and there were several cars there. A fire has been burning nearby for about 24 hrs. At the lake there was evidence of smoke but it wasn't bad. Jumping in the lake was amazing! We ate lunch and headed back down. Passed far more folks headed up as we were descending. Cant wait to go back and camp with our kids!

Cyclone Lake	FriendlyFrida	Obstacles on trail:	    Trees down across trail,	    Muddy or wet trail,	    Overgrown in places.	Since there are just a handful of updates here, I thought I would check this place out for myself! I have to say that this is one of those places where the payoff far exceeds the effort put into the journey, as sometimes you just don’t know exactly what you might get with so few trip reports. Yet this area is gorgeous and peaceful and the trek provides a healthy dose of adventure for any backpacking junkie. We parked at the trailhead which is really just the old forest road 1570 that's blocked off and converted into a trail. There's space for about 3 cars there but more can park closer to the river or even across from the river. We followed the old overgrown road to the end and began the "steeps". This was no joke and reminded me of Eldorado. It was not difficult to navigate but there are quite a few fallen trees to get over and around. The trail for Cyclone Lake breaks off before the Found Lake trail descends. More. Grueling. Ups. And less shade. However, coming up this first knoll is when the views start really showing off. Following the ridgeline began a whole rollercoaster of physical and emotional experiences. These views! Ow my legs! Found Lake has a cute little island! These mosquitos are eeevil! Yay downhill! Oh crap, uphill! But pain is half the fun and it sure was well worth it when we finally saw Cyclone Lake in front of us. On a side note, it seemed like all the lakes in the area, Found, Stormking, Cyclone, etc., were all a different color! We camped near Cyclone Lake. There are a decent number of spots to camp so it’s worth the time setting your pack down to look around because none are immediately obvious. I think the best spot is just at the outlet of a tarn that you first come upon when coming down the hill to enter the Cyclone Lake area. We never saw the spot coming in but it was big and flat! Cyclone Lake is gorgeous and the prominent Stormking Mountain provides a nice crown to the lake. In the morning we headed up towards the summit of Stormking to see how far we'd get with the pupper and with our already jello-like legs. We left at about 5:50am, to a hazy sunrise; wildfires are in full force these days. We went back up to the ridgeline that we came in on and continued along it. We stayed on the rocks almost the entire way up. There are some nice flat spots along the ridgeline for camping if you don't mind being away from the lake. There's even a place higher up with little pools of crystal clear water. Anyways, we followed the boulders up most of the way until we could not any more, at about 7100’. From this point, we could see that some footprints traversed the east facing slope that has snow and then perhaps summited via a northeastern ridge. We watched a fella continue on past us by downclimbing some rocks to get over to the final summit and made it up the steep south facing wall. My dog, my friend, and myself were pretty content with our stopping point. We reached our almost summit at 8am. A few considerations: Bring LOTS of water since there is no reliable source between the river at the bottom of the road until Cyclone Lake itself. In addition to Cyclone Lake, there's a couple other very nearby lakes we neglected to explore. The up and downhill swings required a decent amount of hand holds and vegge belays. All in all, it was a challenging hike, we encountered a small and friendly crowd, beautiful lakes and amazing mountain landscapes while the mosquitos feasted on me.

Marten Creek	mato	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	SAR had the Spada watershed closed. (they were busy this weekend!) Didn't have a Plan B, but knew I didn't want to be on the wrong side of Sultan on a Sunday afternoon. So off to the 'Loop it is! Decided to check out Marten Creek for no particular reason; other than it promised to be uncrowded. Sounded like the Boulder River trail - no real destination. The similarities end there... This trail gets down to business right from the start. The sound of the creek soon fades away - you never even got to see it.  No creekside walk here - the trail heads up the ridge thru giant trees on an old roadbed. Very steep. Good thing it's in the shade. Finally, it levels off a bit, and ... never mind. Up we go again. By now you're thinking "This better be worth it." The trail does eventually  level, and finally drops close to the creek. You can see it.Twenty feet below. But no; this trail can't be bothered with that. You continue on, climbing once again... You soon come to a slide area, and what-do-ya-know - a view! Nice shot of Three Fingers up the valley - but that's it on this hike. The same trees that provide the shade also block any view. The trail now starts heading down, and then just sort of peters out. One second you're cruising along, and the next you're wondering where the trail went. Some orange flags go this way, and some pink ones go that way. The trail looks to head down the hill? Not really apparent which one goes where, but it can't just end, can it? All this way for this?! I just wanted to chill by the creek. So back I go to the spot by the creek. A steep trail goes down about twenty feet to the rocks. A low hanging branch allows you to lower yourself down. Really pretty area of pools and rock ledges. Downstream about 100 yds., you end up at the top of a waterfall. It drops about 20 ft. into a pool, then another, and then thru a rocky chute and into a large, deep, green pool. THAT'S the spot! It looks like it wouldn't be too difficult to work your way around the falls and find a way down there. Today, I was lacking time and energy. It's a shame to add it to my Next Time list, because I don't know if I'll be back. It's a steep hike, with no view, and no access to the creek. Seems there is no real reason for this hike, other than to see what condition your condition is in. But if you're a hardy hiker, who wants a well earned trail to yourself - here ya go!	Aug 05, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-05.4805952896
Perry Creek	jeffdill	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	Hazy, hot day on the mountain. The hike is a nice relatively easy grade up to the falls, which makes a pretty good turnaround spot if you want a shorter hike, but if you choose to keep going to the meadows the elevation gain really kicks into gear after you pass the falls, it's definitely a strenuous hike. There's plenty of room to spread out and enjoy lunch at the meadow. It took me 1.5 hours to get to the falls and another 1.5 hours to get to the top, then 2hr15min to get back to the trailhead. Closer to the trailhead there was a constant whirring from a helicopter searching for the missing hiker at Vesper Peak. Much respect to the hard work by first responders and volunteers.

IP Road (former Yale Reservoir Logging Road)	BeaverDawg	Obstacles on trail:	    Trees down across trail,	    Mud/Rock slide or washout.	Road suitable for all vehicles	We wanted to explore some new-to-us trails so after a trip up to Butte Camp we checked out the IP road.  It's basically an abandoned road which is perfect for a nice, flat, mostly paved stroll.  Some sections were perfectly clear asphalt while others had gravel humps, or thick debris.   If you are walking or biking you should be careful of rocks and sticks underneath the duff-covered sections as it's possible to trip/crash or twist an ankle.     It is a shaded trail (depending on time of day) along Yale Reservoir with nice views of the water.  There seemed to be a regatta of sorts going on today which added to the scenery.  There's a large tree (or clump of trees) down around 3 miles in, you can get around it easily on the lake side of the trail.   We reached the washout noted in the trail description, and walked up the congested creek bed for 50 yards or so then returned and crossed to the other side of the washed out road.  We continued up the road until we began seeing increasing evidence of "man", there was a line strung across the road with a shower curtain on one end, wads of TP scattered up and down the road and looking ahead, we could see a tent in the middle of the road.   We chose to turn around at this point.  We did not see anyone else until our return about a mile from the gate. There is a lot of potential here, pretty views of the lake, a nice flat trail suitable to all ages and abilities. There was some trash along the trail but not nothing like after the washout, which is presumably from boaters who land to camp?  We picked up some trash but again failed to have an actual trash bag with us, so we weren't able to make much of an impact. We stopped in at Yale Park to see what the shore along the trail looked like from across the lake.  The park attendant confirmed that despite the fact that they are not supposed to,  boaters camp along the IP road shore.  I guess that explains a few things.... 	Aug 05, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-05.5798507354
Ira Spring Trail - Mason Lake	northwest_yogi	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were terrible	Snow free	Hiked Mason Lake for the first time today. As a few others have mentioned, the roughest part of the road is where the concrete ends...there are a few potholes, but the road is completely passable for all vehicles. Trail was in great condition and we had no problem navigating. This one will get your heart pumping - my hiking partner and I are both very active people, and it took us about two hours to get to the lake (just over an hour on the way back). The views along the final few switchbacks before the descent to Mason Lake were absolutely stunning, with loads of wildflowers in bloom! Those switchbacks are definitely the most exposed part of the trail, so be sure to bring sunscreen and / or a hat to protect your face. The toughest part to deal with by far was the bugs / flies - I don’t know if it was the weather, but they were absolutely relentless. They moved in immediately any time we stopped for a breather on the trail, and would not leave us alone at the lake, which made it tough to enjoy our downtime there - make sure you’ve got some powerful insect repellent! With the right gear and tools, this is an absolutely gorgeous hike. Highly recommend! 	Aug 05, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-05.1374082040
Snow Lake	John SWIG Swigert	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	This is a short trip report to show the progress on a washed out area of the Snow Lake Trail in the area of switchbacks just below the overlook to the lake.   The WTA Volunteer crew did regular maintenance work along the trail and a smaller group went further up to continue working on the washout project started on a previous trail work party.   The attached photos show the lake from the overlook and the before & after  shots of the tread repair project.  It was a busy day on the trail with a steady stream of hikers of all ages and sizes including quite a few of the four legged kind.   Thanks to everyone for your patience as we stopped traffic temporarily to move the large rocks we used to build up the trail back to tread level.   We especially appreciate all the recognition from the hiking community as you passed thru commenting on the work our awesome group of volunteers do day-in and day-out to maintain and build the great network of trails we have in this region.   Have a great summer hiking season.  See you on trail soon...SWIG	Aug 05, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-05.7641462155
Ira Spring Trail - Mason Lake	N Young	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	Great day for a hike. Started from the trailhead at 9:45 am. The views were great. Mt Rainier was not as clear as there was a lot of haze in the air. Trail was quite crowded but otherwise uneventful.

Cold Creek Loop via Tinkham and Silver Peaks	Squashroll	Minor obstacles posing few problems	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	First off I have to say you can get to the Windy Pass trailhead in a 2WD car.  We read in previous reports that the road was bad, and it is, but it's passable.  When we came out on foot there was both a Corolla and a Scion XD.   Started hike at the sharp bend by Cold Creek trailhead. From there we hiked a lonely trail to twin lakes, where we crossed over the creek on a nice log and proceeded west along the lake.  Very shortly the trail became overgrown; so much so we thought we had gone the wrong way.  Proceeding back to the log crossing we looked for other trails, but found nothing.  We decided to try again and pushed through.  The trail improves after about a half mile of dense brush.  I could tell we were maybe on an old trail only from stubby stems of shrubbery that had clearly been cut previously.  After the dense undergrowth the trail continues on steep switchbacks untill you join the PCT (Lots of good Huckleberries). Turning right we scooted along the much improved trail to the Silver Peak marker (a nice cairn etched 'silver peak').  Regrettably we were a bit low on water so decided to skip Silver Peak and continue the loop.  Insert frowny face.  The rest of the hike was a breeze.  We emerged at Windy Pass, where we encountered the aforementioned 2WD vehicles.  Turning right on the road and going about a quarter mile we rejoined the trail on the right to continue back to twin lakes.  We were told that that trail was much better than following the road.  Maybe; its very tight walking through a lot of downhill 'trench-ish' type trail. Not that great.  An uneventful trail brought us back to our dusty Prius.   Overall decent hike. As soon as you stop moving (read: try to pee) you will be hassled by flies. One such event left urine all over my pants and shoes as I tried to dance away from them.  We recommend pants for the dense shrubby area.  	Aug 05, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-05.3518749612
Lime Kiln Trail	Lunapeople	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Hot day plus old dog (a loaner for the weekend) plus I-90 Seafair traffic equals an easy, shady hike on the Mountain Loop. Our first time on the Lime Kiln trail. It made a pleasant easy, shady hike, the highlight besides the kiln was sitting by the beautiful South Fork of the Stilly, so be sure you don't just turn around at the kiln, it's only another 0.7 miles to the river. Tread is mostly smooth, views of the river from parts. Parking lot much bigger than I thought. Plenty of people with kids and dogs out. 	Aug 05, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-05.2369607569
Chenuis Falls	Gla25609	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Perfect day today.  We arrived at the trailhead about 8:30 AM.  There were quite a few cars but not a lot of people.  Since it is wide service road almost the whole way and a very gentle slope it was basically a leisurely walk.  The forest is just beautiful.  The huge trees and all the underbrush.  The periodic views of the hillsides was tremendous.   Green trees, blue skies.  We did pass a few people coming back down, several coming from Ipsut. Creek campground.  On our way back we passed a lot more, most on their way to overnight stays.	Aug 05, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-05.0251437671

Clear Lost Trail to Lost Lake Lookout	coreyg	Obstacles on trail:	    .	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were terrible	OK, this is a belated trip report, and it covers two consecutive weekends when I made a trip up to Clear Lost. I have to admit I have been hesitant to post a report about this hike.  I discovered this trail in summer 2016 and I've been a fan ever since.  The trail (just west of White Pass) is mostly hidden and not very known.  So if you want seclusion this is a trail for you (except for when the PCT is bypassed through it...which happened recently).  Trip#1:  For 2018, I hiked on the weekend of 7/28.  This was a HOT weekend & we wanted to escape the heat!  (In fact, I didn't pack a sleeping bag!  I only had a cheap Costco down blanket & it was more than adequate!)  Let me see, not much to report here.  Saw NO ONE the entire 14-miles we hiked!  (I loved that!)  Saw huckleberries from a band of 3500-4500', so they distracted a little.  We set up camp at Lost Hat Lake & had it all to ourselves.  The black flies were a nuisance for most of the climb up below 5000', above 5000', mosquitoes were a PAIN from the meadow before Lost Hat Lake, at Lost Hat Lake and even up on the ridge!!  They sucked! (literally!) Unfortunately the views weren't that great on the ridge due to fires.  But up here we did see the crazy thunderstorms swirl around us (we didn't get any rain on us.  But we did see the lightning show---along the Hogsback, at White Pass and down at Clear Lake....the Miriam Fire definitely came from this 7/28 storm.   I flyfished a little at the lake (when mosquitoes allowed me) & caught and released some nice ones.  The next morning I took a dip in the lake and then we hiked out. Trip #2:  This was the weekend of Aug 5th.  What a difference a week makes.  First up--the Miriam Fire was raging.  The PCT was rerouted and through Clear Lost, so there was a world of activity on the trail!   Bugs were a little better, and berries were also a little sweeter.  Made it up to Lost Hat just as the weather was rolling in.  And we got a torrent!  Luckily we had time to set up all of our shelters and jump in and wait it out for an hour.  There was a group already up here who had a fire going.  They were nice.  And they were also fishing the lake.  Because of the weather, we just hung out at the lake--no ridge hike & no swimming in the lake.  Saw some crazy weather though.  There was a cloud which very quickly enveloped the lake--I thought a fire snuck up on us!  We fished and it went so so.   The night.  Oh the night!!  Stupidly, I only packed a blanket again...and I paid the piper!  It was FREEZING!!!  This made for a tough night.  My friend caught a trout in the morning and this raised spirits--that and the clear views of Rainier! The only thing worth noting was the river crossing on the way back.  The river didn't look higher, but it looked way different from its usual crystal clear splendor.  I reckon the heavy rain caused a big flood down this river, because the river was full of silt and mud was above water line all over.  Just took it slow crossing.   Oh, one other thing...we ran into some errant SOBO PCT-ers as we hiked out.  They made it all the way to the Coyote/Lost Hat Lakes intersection....apparently they missed the sign for the PCT reroute!  anyway, we steered them the right way. And both trips were ended by yummy tacos at the taco truck and the new Single Hill Brewery in Yakima.  So much yum!!

Dewey Lake	CiscoKitty	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	Started early to avoid the heat and crowds. It was confusing at first where I started with the dog. I was at the Tipso parking lot. Depending on what direction you are headed on 410 is why I ended up here. It states no dogs but you start out on the trail and head away from the lakes and up a hill to a bridge that crosses 410. You are on a portion of the PCT and dogs are allowed. You’ll eventually, after the tarn, come to a junction where either you turn around or head down to Dewey Lake. With a dog you cannot head straight to Naches Look because you are in MRNP and no longer on the PCT. So many mop heads on the trail. I’ve never seen so many. Lots of paintbrush too. Lupine was past its prime same with the Elephant Lousewort. Trail was dry and dusty. Tarn was a tarn. I forgot to look for the salamanders that someone mentioned in a previous trip report in the tarn. Bugs were annoying. Especially the HUGE flies. The dog and I decided on the 700 ft drop to Dewey Lake was an ok thing to do. The lake was nice but way too buggy. The dog didn’t even swim. We ate lunch and instead of getting eaten alive decided to tackle the 700 ft back up. Unfortunately my lunch didn’t agree with me so the whole hike out to the truck I was nauseous. Not an ideal situation out on the trail. At that point it was warmer and was harder on the dog. He’s so patient though and I made sure our rest stops were in what shade we could find. Once you get back up top on the trail there is no shade. Since it was around noon and a Sunday the hordes of people were astounding. It made that last trek from the junction back to truck even longer since I was ill. So many parties were too big and when you have to pull over for multiples your patience can wear thin. That’s why there is a size limit. I wished that was posted on the TH signs. There is a reason for party size limits and it helps with flow of both directions of hikers. I really liked this hike and will do it again, minus the lunch combo I ate.	Aug 05, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-11.8281078450
Council Bluff	wrighthiker	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	Beautiful views for relatively low effort. The lake was very busy but the hike was not. We saw only two other couples/families and had the top all to ourselves! The trail is in good condition but it is dusty right now and there were lots of flies. Still worth it!	Aug 05, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-07.3242911021
Marmot Pass - Upper Big Quilcene	ableoldlady	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	It was a warm, sunny day with some white puffy clouds.  Got lost looking for the trailhead.  Wasted an hour+ driving forest roads.  My advice: put Marmot Pass Trailhead in the GPS of your phone.  Of course, there was no cell service but the GPS in Google Maps still worked.  Found a trailhead full of cars at 9:30 am and did find a space.  Very crowded day-hike.  Lots of kids and dogs.  Thankfully, did not step in poop on the trail.  Campgrounds along the way up the Upper trail almost full with overnighters. Bugs were a problem below 5,000 feet if standing still.  Ate lunch at the pass, the views were awesome.  There was a bit of a breeze at the pass but nothing forcing me to add a layer.  Saw lots of Indian Paintbrush, fading Lupine and other wildflowers the names of which I do not know.  At the pass, could see water to the east, possibly Hood Canal and/or Puget Sound.  No Seattle nor Rainier view today.   Should've put on sunscreen on tops of my shoulders, got a bit of a burn.  Took 4 hours going up and 3 hours descending.  Drank 2 liters of water over the 11.5 miles from trailhead to pass and back.  The views are 360.  IMO, not as awe-inspiring as Mt. Townsend but a great hike nonetheless.  Good starter point for a loopy (or not) backpacking trip.	Aug 05, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-07.3592823112
Trail of Two Forests	pnwrn	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	This was a great trail to conclude our trip to Mt. St. Helens. It is more of a walk in the park since there is a boardwalk and the distance is very short. This trail was not as crowded as Ape Caves which was nearby. On the trail, you could climb into a hole that lava had created. We did not do this as it was already filled with people. The parking lot was near empty and there are restrooms available. There were also two picnic tables which were in use since it was a nice day out. The were hardly any bugs on the trail. 	Aug 05, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-06.5527712216

Unfortunately the views weren't that great on the ridge due to fires.  But up here we did see the crazy thunderstorms swirl around us (we didn't get any rain on us.  But we did see the lightning show---along the Hogsback, at White Pass and down at Clear Lake....the Miriam Fire definitely came from this 7/28 storm.   I flyfished a little at the lake (when mosquitoes allowed me) & caught and released some nice ones.  The next morning I took a dip in the lake and then we hiked out. Trip #2:  This was the weekend of Aug 5th.  What a difference a week makes.  First up--the Miriam Fire was raging.  The PCT was rerouted and through Clear Lost, so there was a world of activity on the trail!   Bugs were a little better, and berries were also a little sweeter.  Made it up to Lost Hat just as the weather was rolling in.  And we got a torrent!  Luckily we had time to set up all of our shelters and jump in and wait it out for an hour.  There was a group already up here who had a fire going.  They were nice.  And they were also fishing the lake.  Because of the weather, we just hung out at the lake--no ridge hike & no swimming in the lake.  Saw some crazy weather though.  There was a cloud which very quickly enveloped the lake--I thought a fire snuck up on us!  We fished and it went so so.   The night.  Oh the night!!  Stupidly, I only packed a blanket again...and I paid the piper!  It was FREEZING!!!  This made for a tough night.  My friend caught a trout in the morning and this raised spirits--that and the clear views of Rainier! The only thing worth noting was the river crossing on the way back.  The river didn't look higher, but it looked way different from its usual crystal clear splendor.  I reckon the heavy rain caused a big flood down this river, because the river was full of silt and mud was above water line all over.  Just took it slow crossing.   Oh, one other thing...we ran into some errant SOBO PCT-ers as we hiked out.  They made it all the way to the Coyote/Lost Hat Lakes intersection....apparently they missed the sign for the PCT reroute!  anyway, we steered them the right way. And both trips were ended by yummy tacos at the taco truck and the new Single Hill Brewery in Yakima.  So much yum!!

Dewey Lake	CiscoKitty	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	Started early to avoid the heat and crowds. It was confusing at first where I started with the dog. I was at the Tipso parking lot. Depending on what direction you are headed on 410 is why I ended up here. It states no dogs but you start out on the trail and head away from the lakes and up a hill to a bridge that crosses 410. You are on a portion of the PCT and dogs are allowed. You’ll eventually, after the tarn, come to a junction where either you turn around or head down to Dewey Lake. With a dog you cannot head straight to Naches Look because you are in MRNP and no longer on the PCT. So many mop heads on the trail. I’ve never seen so many. Lots of paintbrush too. Lupine was past its prime same with the Elephant Lousewort. Trail was dry and dusty. Tarn was a tarn. I forgot to look for the salamanders that someone mentioned in a previous trip report in the tarn. Bugs were annoying. Especially the HUGE flies. The dog and I decided on the 700 ft drop to Dewey Lake was an ok thing to do. The lake was nice but way too buggy. The dog didn’t even swim. We ate lunch and instead of getting eaten alive decided to tackle the 700 ft back up. Unfortunately my lunch didn’t agree with me so the whole hike out to the truck I was nauseous. Not an ideal situation out on the trail. At that point it was warmer and was harder on the dog. He’s so patient though and I made sure our rest stops were in what shade we could find. Once you get back up top on the trail there is no shade. Since it was around noon and a Sunday the hordes of people were astounding. It made that last trek from the junction back to truck even longer since I was ill. So many parties were too big and when you have to pull over for multiples your patience can wear thin. That’s why there is a size limit. I wished that was posted on the TH signs. There is a reason for party size limits and it helps with flow of both directions of hikers. I really liked this hike and will do it again, minus the lunch combo I ate.	Aug 05, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-11.8281078450
Council Bluff	wrighthiker	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	Beautiful views for relatively low effort. The lake was very busy but the hike was not. We saw only two other couples/families and had the top all to ourselves! The trail is in good condition but it is dusty right now and there were lots of flies. Still worth it!	Aug 05, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-07.3242911021
Marmot Pass - Upper Big Quilcene	ableoldlady	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	It was a warm, sunny day with some white puffy clouds.  Got lost looking for the trailhead.  Wasted an hour+ driving forest roads.  My advice: put Marmot Pass Trailhead in the GPS of your phone.  Of course, there was no cell service but the GPS in Google Maps still worked.  Found a trailhead full of cars at 9:30 am and did find a space.  Very crowded day-hike.  Lots of kids and dogs.  Thankfully, did not step in poop on the trail.  Campgrounds along the way up the Upper trail almost full with overnighters. Bugs were a problem below 5,000 feet if standing still.  Ate lunch at the pass, the views were awesome.  There was a bit of a breeze at the pass but nothing forcing me to add a layer.  Saw lots of Indian Paintbrush, fading Lupine and other wildflowers the names of which I do not know.  At the pass, could see water to the east, possibly Hood Canal and/or Puget Sound.  No Seattle nor Rainier view today.   Should've put on sunscreen on tops of my shoulders, got a bit of a burn.  Took 4 hours going up and 3 hours descending.  Drank 2 liters of water over the 11.5 miles from trailhead to pass and back.  The views are 360.  IMO, not as awe-inspiring as Mt. Townsend but a great hike nonetheless.  Good starter point for a loopy (or not) backpacking trip.	Aug 05, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-07.3592823112
Trail of Two Forests	pnwrn	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	This was a great trail to conclude our trip to Mt. St. Helens. It is more of a walk in the park since there is a boardwalk and the distance is very short. This trail was not as crowded as Ape Caves which was nearby. On the trail, you could climb into a hole that lava had created. We did not do this as it was already filled with people. The parking lot was near empty and there are restrooms available. There were also two picnic tables which were in use since it was a nice day out. The were hardly any bugs on the trail. 	Aug 05, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-06.5527712216
Tubal Cain Mine	Peter Ellis	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Day two of two volunteering with Charlie on Tubal Cain! My group today ended up starting work right after the bridge past the shelter, clearing the drainage features along the uphill side of the trail and attempting to ensure that the associated culverts weren't clogged. Some inventiveness with sticks was involved with the culverts, as well as re-stacking some of the rocks that protect the outlet side of the culvert from being stepped on or otherwise disturbed. A small but plucky crew of four (myself included!) headed up the trail improving and adding drainage prior to lunch, as well as reviewing potential fixes for slope issues on the trail tread. After lunch, though, a higher priority project was identified where the outside edge of the trail wasn't stable. We cut a few long logs, staked them in place in a stack in order to give the tread something to rest on, then backfilled with dirt. The newly built retainer logs should hold the trail up much better and allow for better durability. All said, we went in maybe a half mile for the entire day - so look for and enjoy the little changes we made to help make the trail more durable and sustainable!

Park Butte	QAhiker	Obstacles on trail:	    Trees down across trail,	    Difficult stream crossing(s).	Road rough but passable	This was my first time hiking these two trails and I am very happy to confirm that they are as beautiful and spectacular as I have read about.  Conversely, the roads to the trailhead were   as bad as I had feared based on many comments in trip reports. I did have a 4WD SUV, and would recommend it if you have one available to you, but there were plenty of lower clearance cars at the trailhead.  FS Road 12 is unmarked (by number), but is just about 12, or 12.1 miles up the Baker River Road from Hwy 20   after a bridge.  In any event, it is a bit shy of the 12.3 miles reported in the driving directions.  FS Road 13 is signed by number.  As you drive down FS Road 12, ignore all other roads taking off to the right until you see the FS 13 sign (there is also a larger sign indicating a couple other trails straight ahead). Follow FS road 13 right to the trailhead.  FS 12 is worse than 13, but the worst of it are within the first mile or so of Baker River Road.  FS 13 has some rough spots too, but I was pretty consistently able to maintain 25-30 mph on it.  After seeing only one other car on the drive up FS 12 and 13, I was surprised how big, and busy, the trailhead parking lot was, but I had no trouble finding a spot.  Restroom facilities were pleasantly clean and well stocked--always a nice touch! I was on the trail a little before 9:00 (2.5 hours drive time from Seattle).  Park Butte trail is in excellent shape and the vistas were amazing and got continually better the higher I went.  The trail did not seem overly busy on my way up, but there were a large number of people at the fire lookout relaxing, eating, and enjoying the view and the sunny weather.  On my way back down however, there was a fairly consistent stream of hikers headed up.  When I got back to the junction of the Park Butte and Scott Paul Trails (which is about 2 miles from the trailhead), I decided to finish the rest of the Scott Paul loop, and I am glad I did.  Six miles from this point back to the trailhead if you take the Scott Paul trail.  Much more solitude on this trail than on Park Butte (I only encountered a few groups of hikers), but it also has stunning views of Mt Baker, several rivers/streams to cross, and you hike through and over a couple of lateral moraines.  Nice variety on this trail and good wildflowers in the meadows.  There are a couple of blow downs that fell along the trail, rather than across it--one of which requires carefully walking along the top of the trunk and avoiding the branches that stick up form it-- and a couple of stream crossings on rocks that could be tricky for some.  Given the number of stream crossings on both trails that have had bridges installed, I was a bit surprised that at least one of these two didn't also have one constructed.  Could be a challenge for some younger or older hikers, or anyone less steady on their feet as some hopping from rock to rock is required. All in, doing both these trails makes for a bit of a strenuous day, but I highly recommend seeing both if you are in the area.  Total mileage is about 11 miles with 2,900 ft of elevation gain.  If you only wanted to do one, I'm actually not sure which of the two I would recommend---you won't go wrong either way!

Blanca Lake	ByRandomChance	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Had an amazing day hike at Blanca Lake. We left Seattle a little before 5 AM and were at the parking area and off on the path to the actual trailhead by 7 AM. Hike there took about three hours, then about the same back, but we went at a leisurely pace. The first two miles are a nice warmup and you can definitely see why the washout won’t be fixed for some time... it’s pretty massive. Use the portapotty where you park, because the privy at the actual trailhead is locked. Once you hit the actual trail, it is just as much elevation and just as many switchbacks as other have said! Trekking poles were a big help as we powered up the path. The trail - while beautiful as all forests are - is rather “boring” if you’re looking for amazing views as you hike to keep you going. But if you put in the sweat to get to the top of the ridge, you are rewarded. We also were not really bothered by bugs at all. We didn't wear any bug spray on the way up and it was totally fine (morning), and coming back down later in the day, I preemptively sprayed myself in anticipation for it being worse, but probably could have gone with out, even. I heard some people complaining about bugs on their way past us, so maybe it just depends on if they like eating you or not! But we didn't have any issues the entire time, either with or without spray. After reaching the top, you still have a good 30 minutes ahead of you winding back down toward the lake. Honestly, this portion of the trail was trickier than the up portion had been (also wetter, so be careful!). Immediately before the downhill portion really begins, there’s a very small lake. We joked about whether anyone has ever gotten there and thought that was Blanca... while it was a joke, it wouldn’t surprise me if it’s happened at least once! Keep going past that little lake. When you get to Blanca, it appears around a curve and it’s just stunning. Even more beautiful than photos can show! Our morning was clear but a tad hazy from wildfire smoke. By the time we left, that had burned off and the water was even more brilliant. We spent about 90 mins at the lake. We DID swim! It was cold, but worth it! Water shoes would have been a huge help, though, as the lake bottom is covered in deadfall and both super prickly and slippery. Easy to cut yourself up on. A guy in another group near us dove in and got some bad scratches down his arms and side because it was more shallow - and covered in more branches - than he anticipated. There are deep portions, but the water prevents you from seeing much so be very careful jumping and diving. We left a little before noon for the hike back. It took longer than we anticipated - we kept thinking the switchbacks going down we’re near an end and they kept on coming! But the lake was worth it. Tons more cars parked along the road when we got back, but still room. And while there were lots of cars, we never felt too crowded on the trail or at the lake. Bring plenty of water and please remember to pick up your trash if you have snacks! We cleaned up several granola bar wrappers that someone else had left behind at one of the viewpoints overlooking the lake. Not cool! All in all, a really wonderful hike and one you should definitely have on your list. It isn’t easy by any means, but is totally doable by anyone in halfway decent shape, as long as you put your mind too it. You pay for the lake with your sweat getting there, but it’s absolutely worth it!	Aug 05, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-06.0806545495
Diablo Lake	Melissa P	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	We started the hike around 10:45 am and were finished by 3:30. Hiked at a moderate pace and stopped for lunch plus plenty of photo ops. Favorite parts of the trail include the view, the shade (mostly shaded, though there were parts of sun), and the lack of crowds (there certainly were other hikers but it never felt crowded). Definitely bring bug spray - we used Jungle Juice and applied a few times and were mostly not bothered. At the suspension bridge, you have the option of returning on the road (I think), taking the road to a ferry ($10) or returning on the trail. We took the trail back and enjoyed the views again. Bring a swimsuit and/or water shoes for a dip in the lake at the end of the trail. I'd give the hike 4.5/5 stars.

Bearhead Mountain	lomorg	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	The trail itself is in excellent condition, not too much effort for excellent views, even though Rainier was partially covered in clouds and we couldn't see Baker and the Olympics due to the haze. Took us 1.5 hours to get to the top. At the top we explored both the actual summit and the rock on the other side (turn right just before reaching the top) where the views to the south east open up. The way down took 1 hour.	Aug 05, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-06.4874643089
Heliotrope Ridge	znarffsu	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	The hike was ok up to the point where the trail splits for either Heliotrope ridge or the Climbers Camp. We heard from several people that the river between us and the Glacier on the Heliotrope trail section was flowing almost too hard to cross safely so we chose to visit the climbers camp. I’m glad we did because the views were breathtaking. We set up our tent next to one of the main streams flowing off the snow field/glacier that was just a hundred yards away. The sunset was amazing, the stars were unobstructed from light pollution, and around midnight we enjoyed watching the trail of lights heading away from our camp area and up the slope of Mount Baker. We talked to a few people late the next morning as they returned from summiting. They reported low wind and clear views. Obviously it goes without saying that these are well prepared climbers and you shouldn’t attempt to summit Baker without a guide. Overall I would give the views from the climbers camp a 10 out of 10. It’s steep climbing on the trail to get up there but my 10 year old did it with a loaded backpack.	Aug 05, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-05.4647064033
Woodard Bay Conservation Area	ejain	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Started out at 3pm from a full parking lot at Witham Road, after a paddle tour around Woodard and Chapman Bay. Followed the Loop Trail to Weyer Point, and the Witham Road back, as shown on the  . No issues with any of the trails. Lots of harbor seals and cormorants on the rafts and pilings that are visible from Weyer Point. Binoculars were useful. Encountered only a couple of people on the trail.

Pratt River Trail	TiffanyBerry	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Hiked this with two 8yo’s and two adults. Went the full 6 Miles. The elevation gain listed hides the fact that it is gentle up and down the whole way, though overall nothing very steep. Red huckleberry dominates the first half of the hike, purple creeps in more the second half. There’s also salal and native blackberry along the trail if you look closely. The side trail down to the Snoqualmie fork at the end of 3 Miles, before turning along the Pratt River, is easy to miss (flagging tape has fallen down and is in small pieces), extremely overgrown, and blends into the overgrown last quarter mile of the 3 mile trail. The route down to the water is very short, and in addition to being overgrown, has a very steep section that has a rope to help you get back up. Despite the difficulties, we did enjoy playing in the river for a while, with the amazing clay and unusually shaped rocks.

Annette Lake	trees please	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Arrived to the trail head around 7:30am, only a few cars in the parking lot. Road leading to the lot had some small potholes that didn't affect our high-clearance vehicle, though I'd just keep an eye out if I were in a regular car. Neither of us noticed any bugs in the parking lot and were able to change into hiking shoes and organize gear without any issue. After having read all the other reports about the bugs being terrible, I had applied aloe mixed with a few drops of tea tree oil to my skin prior to leaving the city and did not apply anything else for the duration. My companion didn't apply any insect repellent at all.  Trail crews have done a beautiful job with the bridges on this trail. It was fairly quiet, a few people with dogs, a few overnighters packing out, and two guys in full camo with hunting rifles scoping the hillside who said they were looking for bears. Didn't notice any bugs on the trail.	Aug 05, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-05.8651576345
Fidalgo Head Loop Trail	Quantum Guru	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	As a newcomer to Anacortes this year I have been exploring hiking trails in the area, occasionally as a solo hiker and often with my hiking buddy Marin. This "trip" report actually summarizes several recent visits to Washington Park, beginning in late June and continuing through early August. It suggests what now seems to us the most enjoyable of the hiking route options. Washington Park sits at the northwestern tip of Anacortes. When viewed from the sea the area is referred to as Fidalgo Head. The terrain varies from rain forest on the north to open, stony hillsides with few trees on the south. The park has an extensive network of trails, but these are not like the trails you expect in an urban park. Many seem more like backcountry trails: rooty, often rocky, sometimes gritty, narrow and traversing or climbing steep hillsides. So if you follow our route come prepared for a real hike. Sturdy trail shoes are in order, and perhaps even trekking poles. We downloaded a park map from    https://www.anacorteswa.gov/DocumentCenter/View/4771/Park-Area-Map-PDF We printed a paper copy (or you could install the pdf version on your phone.) Clearly, the park trail network is somewhat complex particularly in the southwestern corner near Juniper Point. While many trailheads and intersections are well-signed, a few key trail junctions currently lack signs. And the situation is complicated by the many social trails that compete for hikers' attention. We drove into the park via Sunset Ave (or you could take Skagit Transit Bus 410 to Old Salt's Deli on Skyline Way, and walk the half-mile to the park.)  Pass the large gravel parking lot on your right, then turn right into the smaller lot where you likely will find parking (free) in the partial shade of the trees or, if this area is full, backtrack to that big gravel lot and park north of the log barriers (south is boat-trailer overflow.) Don't be discouraged if there seem to be too many cars here. Most of those folks will be at the beach or out in a boat, not hiking the trails. Restrooms are in the white building straight west, past the boat-trailer parking lot. To begin, we found the sign for Trail 501 on the south side of the access road, near where we parked, and headed south on the trail. This corner of the park is rainforest with large firs and cedars, and even larger stumps, and there are a lot of ferns and shrubs in the understory. At apparent trail intersections, the best signs show arrows and trail numbers. But a few signs just display cryptic graphics, and these may be less helpful. For reference, stay right at the first trail fork. Then head left at each of the next two trail forks. After that, the next two upcoming trail forks are marked with the trail number and arrows so you can stay on Trail 501. Between those last two trail forks you will pass a heron rookery. You have to look carefully to see the birds and nests, although in June and early July you certainly will hear the demanding calls of hungry chicks from some distance away. At the next trail junction turn left onto the signed Trail 502 and head downhill. Try to stay on the official trail as it switchbacks a few times, and avoid the social trail that heads left toward a link fence. At the bottom, meander over to the grassy bluff for the views back toward Anacortes, with Mt Erie and Sugarloaf in the distance. The wooded island to the south, across Burrows Channel, is Burrows Island. The prominent trail to your left leads to a private building. Your ongoing route, still Trail 502, heads right, sometimes in the trees, sometimes in more open areas, and often traversing steep slopes where you will need to watch your footing. In about 1200 feet, be alert for a metal sign in a tree on your right. You could easily miss it because it's facing the opposite direction. It flags the upcoming junction with Trail 503 that bends very sharply right and heads steeply uphill, looking uninvitingly stony. Yes, that's your eventual ongoing route. The other two paths you see heading uphill here are social trails, best avoided. But wait! First, note that your Trail 502 continues on downhill toward the water. That's an optional side trip of about 400 feet each way, with elevation change about 80 feet, and you might enjoy doing it for the close-up views of the water. After that side trip, or immediately, head up Trail 503. You may find the footing is not as bad as it first looks (or maybe it is... ) In about 400 feet of steep uphill trail, gaining about 90 feet of elevation, you will intersect Trail 501 (Yes, that's another section of the trail you started out on.)  Two options here: Either head right (toward town) on Trail 501 for about 100 ft, then head left up the short path with the stone steps to reach the Burrows Channel Viewpoint. There are two information boards here, one describes a few of the local wildflowers, the other summarizes some local history. And there is a portable toilet across the road, the only one you will find until you return to your trailhead. Or, if you are skipping the viewpoint, just head left here (toward open water) and continue west on Trail 501. In about 300 feet the unsigned Trail 504 arrives from the right. It's an alternative route down from the viewpoint. And soon a social trail joins your route from the left. Just continue straight on Trail 501. Soon, come to a signed junction where Trail 506 arrives from the right and your Trail 501 continues on straight. But be careful! A prominent social trail bears left here. That's not your route! Your Trail 501 is the less prominent trail that goes straight ahead here. In 200 feet the signed Trail 505 crosses your route. As an optional side trip, take Trail 505 left for about 600 feet, dropping about 100 feet, to a viewpoint near the water's edge. Along the way there are some interesting rock faces exposed just east of the trail. A signboard at the bottom proclaims "Burrows Channel," but then you already knew that. Return to Trail 501 and continue on it another 1500 feet or so to reach a signed T-junction with Trail 510. Head left there. In about 150 feet note an unsigned junction on the left for Trail 512. This short side trail (about 300 feet each way) leads to a viewpoint that is worth seeing, next to some picturesque trees. (Minor social trails might continue on, but you should turn around at the trees and return to Trail 510.) In another 300 feet you will come to a series of trail intersections where you might find the map, the signs, and the trails somewhat confusing. At first we did. Here's a good way to negotiate them: About 150 feet before you reach a large granite boulder (a glacial erratic) be alert for a three-way trail junction. The ongoing trail is signed Trail 510, and you will see the sign for Trail 515 that arrives from your right. It's easy to overlook the fainter Trail 513 that heads off to the left here (the trail sign is in a small tree, about 50 feet down the trail.) Take Trail 513 as it heads downhill. Soon, you may see a trail junction sign for other trails just 100 feet off to your right. It's best to ignore that sign. Don't go there! Just continue on Trail 513 and soon you will be rewarded with a bench seat offering an unobstructed view of the surrounding waters and islands. With luck you will have the bench all to yourself. Enjoy it for a while, then take Trail 513 back to Trail 510 and continue on west.  In about 200, feet come to another unsigned trail junction. This one really needs a sign because Trail 516 heads right here, toward the road, and that's an optional, easier route back to your trailhead. But at least take the left fork for a short distance. At a trail fork stay right, and soon you will come to another bench seat, this one with a view framed by trees. Enjoy this one for a while too. To continue, either return to trail 516 and continue north on it or, for a more adventurous route, take the trail that heads steeply downhill from the bench (not the narrow crack to the right, and not the social trail to the left.) This ongoing route is - or becomes - Trail 517. Try to stay on the main trail here and avoid minor social trails. After a few switchbacks the trail bends sharply to the right and levels out. In a short distance a prominent trail bends sharply left and heads downhill toward the water. You can check it out if you like. It ends in about 200 feet at a signboard that proclaims "Rosario Straight," which is the body of water to the west of Fidalgo Head. Come back to Trail 517 and continue on north to meet the one-way Loop Road. Turn right and follow the road for about 500 feet. Traffic generally is light, and it's one-way in the direction you will be walking. When you come to the sign post for Trail 516, where it crosses the road, head left on that trail. (If you took the easier return route from the second bench you will end up here.) Follow Trail 516 for about one-third of a mile. It's relatively level and is forested the entire way. Along the way you will cross over Trail 518, and will a note a couple of minor side trails that head left out to the road. Eventually, you will cross the road again, and continue on as Trail 516 bends around to the right and follows a narrow, rooty route above the shoreline. There are frequent good views out, and steeply down, to the water and rocky shore. When you come to a signed trail fork with the beach indicated left, take the right fork instead. It will return you to the loop road. The restrooms are in the white building ahead and slightly uphill. To return to your parking area head east (the beach will be to your left and the boat trailer parking area to your right.) Soon you will see your car up ahead. Well, you've done it! About 3.8 miles if you did all the optional side trips. We hope you enjoyed the diverse terrain and the truly exceptional views as much as we did. We already mentioned the herons. It's likely you also saw gulls, ravens, crows, and robins. Perhaps even an eagle. And other birds appear here seasonally. You might have seen a deer in the heavily forested area (although they browse the yards in town too.) In season you likely saw a few wildflowers. If you are a flower fancier, take a few photos and when you get back home check a flower guide and try to identify any you don't know. And do plan to come back and explore some of the many other park trails. Perhaps we will see you there.	Aug 05, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-05.2018094180
Wilson Creek	hikesforchocolate	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	This hike is through a forest that has been destroyed by fire. The black and silver trees and almost complete silence were a bit eerie, even on a bright summer day. Saplings and wildflowers are beginning to grow in places and green pines still stand near the creek, but otherwise it is a fairly bleak landscape. I expected more meandering along the creek, but the trail just crosses it and leaves it behind. I had enough and turned around after a couple miles. Judging by tracks and scat, the trail is only being used by deer, elk, and horses.	Aug 05, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-05.8726735177
Waptus River	Linzlemon88	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	Where to start... Amazing and beautiful destination.  We arrived later than desired on Saturday, Aug. 4. Our GPS took us the wrong way and had us turn into the wrong campground. Then GPS lost signal and we drove around trying to find a signal but failed. Along this drive I spotted a map at a campground & we got back on track. We arrived at the trailhead at 10:15am. The parking lot was full, so we parallel parked along a small island in the parking area. A 1 stall bathroom is at the trailhead.  Once on the trail, the trail meanders through forest, on a very dry dirt path. Some people were wearing scarfs over their mouth & nose for protection. Then through a burnt forest and new growth areas. About 4 miles in, once you're along the river the bugs became annoying. All flies and mosquitos. I applied a non deet bug spray and was mostly fine. Bugs still fly close by, but I only got 2-3 bites on the trail headed out.  Continuing along the river is beautiful. When you are close to the end - about a 1/4-1/2 mile after you pass the sign saying the foot bridge is out, they'll be another Y in the path. Turn right for the horse ford. Going straight will take you around the lake to some other camp spots. The horse ford was just below my knees (I'm 5'7"). Easy to pass with hiking poles. Water was cold but refreshing and once you're in, on a hot day, it was amazing. The campgrounds are not far from there. We took just under 4.5 hours to hike into Waptus Lake, taking a leisurely lunch break.  The view of the mountains is incredible and the water was very refreshing. We waded in. The water was clear. About 5pm an unexpected thunderstorm rolled in. It lasted about 1- 1.5 hours. Then we crawled back out of our tent and watched the fog sweep across the lake & into the mountains. Beautiful. Burn Ban in effect - so no camp fires.  The hike out went a little faster although I swear hiking out is more uphill than hiking in. I think between the rain the night before and me being sweatier, the mosquitos were having a field day around me. It was pretty bad (understatement). I succumbed to putting on a flannel and my head bug net because I just couldn't take it. And bug spray didn't seen to deter them at that point. Once we reached drier land (last 4 miles I'd say) the bugs died down significantly.  Overall, amazing. About 4.5 hr hike in. 4 hr hike out. Bugs bad. water amazing. Daytime temp felt like it was low 80's. Night time, prob about 50F. Camp grounds didn't feel overly crowded, but every spot along the water filled up by nightfall. 	Aug 05, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-05.3559584770
Mount Pilchuck	gabeweb	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Mt. Pilchuck makes an amazing sunrise hike! Got to the trailhead at 3:50 AM and was a bit concerned I'd be hiking in the dark by myself. I shouldn't have worried: about six people were heading up when I drove into the parking lot, and three more drove in as I hit the trail. As I hiked up, I could see intermittent headlamps of people on the trail above and below me. Got to the top 10 minutes before sunrise. I counted about 30 people there, of which about 10 had stayed the night. The sun rose through haze from the forest fires burning in eastern Washington; really amazing. I only stayed 40 minutes at the summit and was back at the parking lot at 7:40 AM (1:40 up 1:20 down) A note about the road: I got up fine in my Prius. Having said that, there are many patches of major potholes to negotiate, and I did bottom out once when I failed to slow down enough.

High Rock	twankie69	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were terrible	Snow free	Beautiful! Great hike! Bugs were particularly bad this time.. take bug repellent and spray it on a few times on the way up.. you will  sweat  it off..can't sit on the rocks behind the shelter completely covered and swarming with flying ants & bees. The steep spots are worth it !! The view at the top is amazing!	Aug 05, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-05.2385609299

Talapus and Olallie Lakes	geezopeezos	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	An excellent hike. Great rewards for moderate effort. The trail is in great condition, but poles really help with the roots and rocks. There has been a lot of work done to improve the muddy areas so we barely touched mud. The parking situation gets a little crazy. There are signs on the road near the trailhead denoting no parking on one side. Further from the trailhead the road widens, so people parked on both sides but it made it pretty narrow to drive through. The lakes are beautiful. I put my feet in Ollalie only, we were able to find a nice quiet spot with some rocks and a log to eat lunch. We made it quick due to the black flies. When the wind picked up the bugs were not as bad. All in all, a great hike!

Rasar State Park	AllieKing	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	We walked this trail with our dog today. It's nice that there are signs at every intersection of the trails so you can decide where you want to go. The views of the Skagit River and gorgeous, and a do not miss. Lots of fresh berries along the trail. Nice walk, would go again! 	Aug 05, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-05.5197825865
Snow Lake	Joannrae22	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	Arrived around 8:30am, parking was relatively easy. Took about an hour and a half to reach Snow Lake, beautiful views! About a half mile from the lake, the bugs become rather irritating so I suggest bug spray.

Island Lake - Rainbow Lake	tteokboki	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Morning trail run to Rainbow Lake. I arrived at the parking lot at 8am and took the last head-in parking space. This was my first time on this trail (and first trip report..) but it now rates as one of my favorites in the region.  Trail is in great shape. I logged ~1 mile to the Granite Mountain trail, ~2 mi to Tallus Lake trail, ~4 mi to the Pratt Lake trail, and ~5.60 mi to Rainbow Lake. The section after the Granite mountain turn-off was really smooth and open. The section on the south slope of Pratt Mountain, just after the Pratt Lake trail descends, is stunning -- it's a little steeper in places here, but it was great to have some exposure to lakes and a valley below. I was moving at all times so I didn't really notice any bugs (it was still cool, also). Although the parking lot was full, I only passed 6 people on the way out, and probably 6-8 small groups on my way back. There were a couple of free parking spaces when I got back to my car just after 10am. I'll certainly be back to explore some of the other sections of this trail system.

Green Lantern Trail	UnicornBananaSlug	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Greeted by an angry goose, we followed a paved trail to Silver Lake. We quickly spied ducks still nestled down and then a bald eagle. We ran into a baptism, not a usual happening on morning’s hike, but of note. Instead of doubling back, we followed the lake around to the parking lot. An easy hour’s adventure. 	Aug 05, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-05.3291515222
Vancouver Lake - North Trail	ninjaracerchick	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Such a good system of trails just on the edge of the city, You feel like you’re way out in the country. Lots of bird watching this morning. Clean park, good bathrooms, and a nice playground. We got a great speed walk in and the little one had fun at the park	Aug 05, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-05.0203458376
Cape Alava Loop (Ozette Triangle)	trillium	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were terrible	Snow free	With 7 year olds, it took us 2 hours & 23 minutes to hike from the parking lot to Cape Alava. It took us 4 hours & 14 minutes to hike from Cape Lava to Sand Point. It took us 1 hour & 38 minutes to hike back to the car. Each of these legs was about 3 miles. YMMV. The 4+ hour beach leg included a lunch stop, a mandatory stop to wait for momma bear and her two cubs to clear out of the beach in front of us, examination of the petroglyphs, and various other beach explorations. There were rope swings everywhere - one at each of the campsites, and a couple along the beach between the two campsites. Lots of deer wandered through the campsites within feet us, oblivious to us. The bear did not seem very interested in humans. She seemed to be waiting for us to get out of her way, much as we were waiting for her to get out of ours. She came out of the forest about 10 feet away from an adult couple, who promptly retreated, leaving their daypack with sandwiches behind, 2 feet from the bear. She was not the least interested. The petroglyphs were worth finding. The majority of hikers simply walk past them, unaware of their existence. The park archaeologist happened to be there when we were (amazing coincidence) and explained some of them to me. The actual "wedding rocks" are slightly north of the Wedding Rocks Point, somewhat above high tide. They are hard to date, but are somewhere between about 200 and 2000 years old. The kids thought the carvings were of fish. They looked a bit like ladybugs to me. The archaeologist explained that they were vulvas. They are wedding rocks after all. The wedding rocks are "broken" in the sense that some many years ago, they used to be upright, and the slab they are carved on fell horizontally. Just south of the  Sunday and Monday nights in mid summer. We had reservations, but there were several open nice campsites at each place. I guess they may get crowded on Friday and Saturday nights. The mosquitoes were pretty bad. We had several types of bug spray and still got bitten. Mostly at dusk and dawn, but some at all times. Good water from streams at both sites (you will need to filter or boil it, though). There is a also a faucet right at the trailhead next to the parking lot. You need to have a national park pass for parking. If you don't already have an annual pass or other pass, you will need to self-envelope-pay $30 at the parking lot. It gets pretty cold in the morning - there may be fog here even if the rest of the state is boiling. You'll want at least a fleece, and maybe more layers than that.

Iron Creek Falls	hikingwithzoe	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	We stayed at the nearby Iron Creek Campground and explored Iron Creek Falls in the evening. Access to the fall is easy and the reward is big. Nice fall, nice creek. We played in the water for a while. Wished we came earlier in the day. Could have easily spend a lazy afternoon at the fall and creek.	Aug 05, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-08.2697061716
Tolmie Peak Lookout - Eunice Lake	253UnaB’s	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were terrible	Snow free	We arrived at the trailhead at 830am. Maybe 10 cars there already. The road up was long, dusty and bumpy but certainly passable in my Honda van. Bugs weren’t too bad on the way up until we got to Eunice Lake. From there up they were definitely an annoyance. Found a spot in the sun up to for lunch with a gorgeous view. A few other groups of hikers up top. As we were headed back down the trail became quite crowded and the bugs were thick!! Kept moving, lots of bug spray and we still got many mosquito bites. Breathtaking views all around though!!! Would definitely try for a weekday next time to help reduce crowds.

Liberty Lake Regional Park - Split Creek Trail	piperh	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	Hiked Liberty Lake up to the waterfall and back. Few things to mention: - The main parking area is about a half a mile from the actual start of the trail. We didn't realize this and thought we had parked in the wrong place, but just kept walking hoping we would eventually find the trail, and we did. It is past all the campsites. - BEES! At the beginning of the trail, there were SO many bees. One particularly aggressive one followed us for a while before we were able to shake it. Just keep an eye out, because there are literally swarms of them. We took the Liberty Lake Trail at the fork (instead of the Split Creek) up to the Cedar Grove. From there we took the trail up the series of switchbacks (pretty steep!) and up to the waterfall. We decided to end the hike here as it was getting rather hot and we needed to be home soon for other plans, but it looks like the hike could be extended from here about another mile (just a guess from the map). We took the Split Creek Trail on the way back down in order to complete the loop. This route, (Parking Lot --> Trailhead --> Liberty Lake Trail --> Waterfall --> Split Creek Trail --> Parking Lot) ended up being about 6.4 miles r/t and took us right around 2 hours and 20 minutes.

Colquhoun Peak	lathrop fam	Obstacles on trail:	    .	Road rough but passable	No bugs	Fun short hike! We braved the 1/2mi rough road up to the trailhead. The parking area is small and had been turned into a camping spot with a fire pit. It’s a short and steep 1/2mi to the ridge line (to the right) and remnants of the old fire lookout(to the left). Rainier was clouded over, but would’ve been incredible. Gotta go back on a clear day! Our 3 young kids thoroughly enjoyed this hike-we even found Bigfoot!

Talapus and Olallie Lakes	ChelseaE06	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Fun hike up to Talapus and Olallie!  Road up was rough but passable in an SUV. Watch out for potholes.  We arrived at the trailhead at 8 am and the very small parking lot was full, but we were able to park on the road about 5 cars down. When we left around 12 pm the entire road was full until no more parking was allowed, so don't try to start this hike mid-day on a weekend! Overall this was a nice hike. Lots of tree roots on the path, but otherwise a very well maintained trail. Bugs weren't noticable until we got to the lake, and then they were around but still wouldn't consider them bad. Didn't use bug spray and I ended up with only 3 bites.  Didn't go swimming, but saw lots of folks swimming at Talapus.  Most of the elevation gain is from Talapus to Olallie. We were hiking mostly alone on the way up, but Olallie Lake was very crowded, and we passed at least 50 people on the way down. Grateful we were done for the day and not starting!

Desolation Peak	cathorse	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Starting at the Ross Lake TH, hiked down to the resort, and picked up our reserved motorboat.  Explored the lake north to our permitted site at Little Beaver and settled in for the night.  Awoke early, and motored to Desolation TH, and started the day hike at 6:30am, with goal to do most of the ascent in the shade and the cool of the morning.  Also, with goal to beat some of the building haze.  Were successful with the first goal, but less so with the second goal.  Views were good, but not great due to the Twisp area fire.  LO was locked up tight when we arrived, but it was fun to peer in through the windows, spying lots of Smokey and Jack Kerouac memorabilia. We read poetry aloud, took plenty of photos, spent about an hour.  Heat was building, so we departed around 11am. As we descended, it got hotter and hotter, so glad we started early, eventually landing down at the dock, putting feet in the lake.  BTW, the small seep is still flowing, but barely. Glad we began our day with 4 liters each.	Aug 05, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-09.5397789626
Noble Knob	KEHuckins	Obstacles on trail:	    .	Road impassable/closed	Bugs were not too bad	ROAD TO TRAILHEAD IS CLOSED. You will have to find alternate routes to get to the Noble Knob trail. See other trip reports for directions. You could walk up the rest of the way but this adds 5 miles to the hike. There is an unnamed trail going from the gate to the Noble Knob trail but it is a dangerous fire zone (downed trees, debris, deteriorated trail). The Noble Knob trail itself is in excellent condition. Recent reports I read were confusing and not exactly clear on this so I was unaware of the extent of the closure when I attempted the trail. Maybe reporters should think about being a bit more explicit and brief about such impertinent information :)	Aug 05, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-09.8220964503
Mount Washington	ehobbsh	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Nice day hike up Mount Washington this past weekend. Got to the trailhead early about 0745, 2 or 3 cars in the parking lot. The trailhead itself is somewhat difficult to find. Start from the parking lot on the Ollalie Talapus trailhead and then go right on the mountain biking trail for a few hundred feet. Other trip reports stated that there was a rock cairn on the left side of the road to signify the start of the trail, I was looking for the traditional pile of rocks but there is actually just pebbles spelling out MTWA. Works I guess. Will attach a picture! The hike itself was very pretty, flowers, berries, views up near the top. Decent amount of elevation gain and way less crowded than other hikes that are a 45min drive from Seattle. Made it up in 2 hours and back to the car just before noon. The parking lot was mostly full and I passed several groups of hikers on my way down. Will be back for sure!	Aug 05, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-08.9575023482
Pratt River Trail	TiffanyBerry	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Did this one with two 8 year olds and two adults. Despite the listed elevation gain, the whole trail is mild up and down the whole way to Pratt River. It’s pretty, and well shaded, though, which is a nice bonus. Know that the last quarter mile or so is extremely brushy (nearly overgrown trail), and the turn off to go down to the Snoqualmie fork the trail follows is unmarked (flagging tape has fallen and broken into pieces), not easy to spot, and though very short, steep enough to have a rope in place to help you get back up to the trail from the river. That tiny side trail down to the river is also almost completely overgrown. The trail had plenty of berries ripe and waiting - mostly red huckleberries near the trailhead and purple on the second half of the hike. There is also ripening salal and a few native blackberry plants along the way. We spent a fair amount of time at the river, playing in the copious quantity of mud and finding extremely interestingly shaped rocks.

Naches Peak Loop	bpeterson	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Gorgeous day for a hike. There was a nice breeze so that kept the bugs away. Huckleberries are ripening near the end of the trail (if you do the loop clockwise). This is a popular hike, for good reason. Everyone can do it. We had a 3.5 year old, a grandma, and a pregnant lady in our party.	Aug 05, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-08.9021663662
Minotaur Lake	Heleene Tambet	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were terrible	Snow free	What a beautiful-beautiful lake! The hike is short but you do get a workout out of it – and some knee sensitivity coming down the steep slope. While I am very happy we decided to go, I have to mention that the mosquitos were worse than I've perhaps EVER experienced. The snow has just melted so there is a fresh young enormous batch of them - and they will hurt. I'd take every kind of spray available out there with me if I were to go again. 	Aug 05, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-07.9122757056
Spectacle Lake	Josh and Laura	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	We set out with 4 people on Sunday for a 2-night trip to Spectacle Lake. It's such a long hike, and such a beautiful destination, we didn't want to just go for one night and turn around to come home. The driving directions on WTA didn't match perfectly with our odometer-- it's a little farther on Salmon la Sac Road (like 18 miles), and then about 2 miles to the Pete Lake trailhead after crossing the bridge on FR 4616. The parking lot was quite full when we arrived, and a ranger was packing up after a trip up to Spectacle (dug a new pit toilet- thank you!). It's about 2 hours to the trailhead from Seattle (we got there about 9:30am). The first 4 miles along the Pete Lake trail are flat, dusty, easygoing horse trail through a wooded forest, just a few rolling ups and downs. There are a few easy stream crossings along the way. Lovely Pete Lake comes into view along with an expansive horse camp. We followed the trail (a few social trails lead mostly to lake access points), stopped at a rock overlooking the water for lunch, and headed on to the Lemah crossing. The ford is COLD and swift moving in parts, but only about knee deep at the deepest. There are a few spots to hop onto a rock bed to warm up in the middle. Feet go numb otherwise! Bring river shoes and poles and you'll be fine. We encountered a few bugs in this area, but not enough to don the mosquito nets. After about another mile, you hook up to the PCT and go through a gorgeous burn area, ripe with fireweed and other flowers. This is such a cool part of the trail. There are no blowdowns to hike over; trail is in great condition. It was hot and exposed in the afternoon when we were heading up, and this part is where the switchbacks begin (after turning left on the PCT, it's about 2.7 miles of ascent to the lake access). After a break at the gorgeous waterfall and wooden bridge, we pushed on through the final mile of switchbacks to reach the Spectacle spur trail. We lay eyes on the lake by 4:30pm. The spur trail takes you by some great views of the lake from above, and then down a rooty, rocky trail to the lake. Nearing the lake, there are a few rocks at a trail junction. Go straight or turn left at that point to reach the campsites on the peninsula. We snagged a great spot on the west side of the peninsula where the wind was blowing more (and the bugs were much less persistent). There are great granite water access points for lake swimming.  There were almost no bugs that night or the next day. During the night we heard some hoof activity, and I turned my headlamp right into the eyes of a big buck with full rack just a few yards away from my tent. What was he doing exploring the peninsula in the middle of the night?? Day 2, we took a day hike on the PCT up (about 2 miles) to the ridge above Spectacle where you get a great view of the lake and surrounding peaks. We spent the rest of the afternoon resting and swimming (brrrr!). It was quite warm at our exposed campsite, so we found some spots in the shade to nap on the sleeping mats. The sun disappeared behind Chikamen ridge by 6:30pm, so it started to cool down, but not too cold. Great stars each night. We headed down Tuesday. Only a few bugs came out the last morning when the air was still. Heading out of the campsite by 8:30am got us to the car by 2pm and back into Seattle around 4:30pm. The last miles seem long on a hot August day! Take your time up there; the lake takes on so many characters! Also take a mid-week trip if possible. We hear it gets crowded on the weekends. We'll be back next year for sure.	Aug 05, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-07.6867258134
Boulder Cave	CMarie4	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Nice little trail to stretch your legs if you are driving over the pass.

Sourdough Mountain	Ambrose Zhi	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were terrible	Snow free	One of the toughest hikes I have ever done. It started off with a very steep uphill, but it got better after the first 1 mile or so. But it's pretty much uphill the entire way. A lot of bugs. These horse flies were trying to suck my blood too. Bug spray is a necessity for this hike!!! With that being said, the views up there were 100% worth it.  I would recommend to bring a lot of water (at least 2L). There will be a creek by Sourdough Camp, so you can filter some water there if you bring a water filter.	Aug 05, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-14.0454127516
Cascade Pass	isabellewallace_	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Arrived at the trail head around 10:30am on a Sunday. The road to the trailhead was a pain... the first 10 miles are paved, but when the pavement ended it was completely washboarded for the next 13 miles. Some sections were steep and had sections of deep loose gravel. Yes, a high clearance vehicle is recommended but most small cars can do it... there were many sedans in the trailhead parking lot. Takes an hour from Marblemount to the trailhead on the Cascade River Road but worth it for the hike. The parking lot was full when we arrived but there are many parking options down the road for a few hundred yards. The trail itself is great - it's a soft surface with few treacherous or rocky sections. The switchbacks are very forgiving, I didn't notice the difficulty or elevation. The final switchback is close to a mile long and takes you right to the end. It was the best part, you'll pass through wildflowers and an avalanche  site, as well as have incredible views of surrounding glaciers and peaks. Took us 2 hours 15 min to get to the pass. Took us 1 hour 45 mins to decent for 4 hours total. 	Aug 05, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-08.9785777614
Fremont Lookout	Jenniferaford	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Beautiful hike with views of Rainier all the way! The Sunrise parking lot was nearly full by 11am when we arrived. Lots of hikers on the trails but plenty of space to spread out. The entire trail was well maintained and easy to navigate. When you get to the lookout, beware of the chipmunks! They're fearless and hungry!	Aug 05, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-08.6870238294
Snow Lake	Elizabeth “Ducky”	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Got to Alpental Parking lot around 8:15, and it was already pretty full for being a Sunday. The bugs were an annoyance in the parking lot, so bug spray is needed if you are going to be in the parking lot for any length of time. The trail itself is in pretty good condition considering how much use it gets. The start has some stairs, the first couple are in great shape. There are some that are very worn down, apparently they were put in about 20 years ago. Some of the metal spikes could be re-pounded into the group or have them completely replaced. Just watch your footing when going up the stairs. Right before the trail opens up into the first avalanche field, a group of WTA trail crews worked to make the trail bed a little less rough, but adding more mineral soil onto the trail. A little further up the trail once it opens up into the small avalanche field it the bushes, kind of en cringe on the trail a little bit. For our work party today, there was a group working on removing the bushes further back away from the trail. Before the Source Lake Trail turn off, the trail was very narrow, and was starting to slop off the downhill side of the trail, and is a very steep hill side. This is the area my group worked on. We removed some plants growing on the up hill side of the trail, and cut into the uphill side of the trail to make it wider. We also used rocks to reinforce the outside edge of the trail so that we could make the trail wider. One of the rocks that you had to climb over was crushed to pieces so that the trail is easier to walk on over the rocks. One of our crew members placed two rock steps to help on a steep little incline of the trail. Through the crowds of people hiking up and down the trail we were able to widen the trail to about four feet wide in this area, from the probably about two feet wide that it was at the start of the day. Our last group worked on a section near the top of the switch backs to reinforce the trail with a rock structure. Being a popular trail, remember to yield to uphill hikers, and be patient when hiking down as you'll have to stop every couple of feet to let other pass. Lots of dogs on the trail, many which looked very hot. If you have a dog, remember to let them cool off in the shade. When we were done for the day, we saw a dog lay down on the cool soil we have just placed on the trail and was panting pretty hard. WTA has worked on this trail in the past, and there is still a lot of work to be done on it with the amount of traffic that it gets. Consider making a donation to WTA, August happens to be their biggest fundraiser (Hike-a-Thon!) If you would like to make a donation to #Hike-a-Thon all proceeds go directly back to trails, feel free to sponsor me: https:give.wta.org/ElizabethHikes Saturday's group saw a lot more hikers on the trail than we did, maybe it has something to do with Saturday having been #WATRAILSDAY If you'd like to come out and join us on the trails go to wta.org/volunteer and sign up for a trail party, we'd love to have you join us.

Cherry Creek Falls	seattlefreezer	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Nice easy Sunday morning hike. Arrived at the parking lot at 7:15am and we were the first ones there. The trail itself splits off a few times and it's not clear what is the main route to the falls but I'm guessing all the routes eventually get there. The falls were very pretty although they were getting low this late in the season. By the time we left the parking lots and street parking were all full. 	Aug 05, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-07.9273254409
Mount Pugh	EricN	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Had a great hike up Mount Pugh. Road to get there had a few potholes, but nothing too bad any vehicle should be able to get up. We were worried about bugs because of previously trip reports, but had only minor bug issues all day. You start hiking through a forest, the trail is in great condition for most of this, a few trees have fallen and you have to cross them, but that's it. When we reached a lake we got our first glimpse of what we thought was Mount Pugh towering above us (we later realized what we were really in for) and our first ripe blue berries. We continued on eventually reaching the meadow. This is where the fun really begins. The switchbacks up are pretty steep, some big steps required in a few sections as well. Every switch back reveals a new mountain with great views of Sloan, Whitehorse, and Three Fingers. It was hard to make most out with the haze though. When we reached the top of the meadow we got a glimpse of Mount Baker, probably an hour before it disappeared completely into the haze. From here you walk a bit further until you reach the spine and get your first look at the peak and realize that you still have a lot of climbing to do. The walk along the spine was one of my favorite parts, great views of the peak to your left and the mountains on the other side. There are a few confusing sections, but its easy to backtrack and try again. At the end of the spine you walk over an exposed transition between the spine and peak, this was a bit uncomfortable, but it's not too narrow. From here you start scrambling and taking more switchbacks up the peak. From here on it was much easier than it looked like it would be from afar. We saw 2 marmots perching on an outcropping below away as well as one about 10 feet from us. At the peak you finally see your reward with 360 views of the cascades and Glacier Peak towering in front of you. With the haze we were limited on what we could see, but it was still amazing with a bald eagle riding the thermals to top it off. We hung out for about an hour before trekking back down. We got a bit lost at one point on the spine, but were able to go back up and find the trail again. Going down the meadow wasn't too bad, Sloan having cleared up a bit provided some good views. From there the never ending forest back to the car started. We ended up taking 11 hours from car to car. We stopped a lot for pictures, took some breaks, and spent almost an hour on top, so it could be done much faster. My GPS watch claims 6:10 moving time, but I highly doubt we stood still for 5 hours.

Ape Caves	pnwrn	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	I had never seen anything like it before. The caves I visited in California were different in that they had rock formation coming from the ceiling and was very well preserved.  We arrived at Ape Caves in the afternoon on a Sunday and it was PACKED. The parking lot was full and the trailhead was flooded with people. We definitely came during the busy season since there were tons of families and children all around us. It was so busy, that in the cave on the "easier" routes, you could always see people in front of you. It was like walking on a really busy street.  The cave was very beautiful and cool. I was wearing jeans and a comfy fleece jacket and felt comfortable. I also saw people in sandals and typical summer clothes. Keep in mind that the cave is about 40 degrees-- so dress accordingly. For this cave, I brought a headlamp, lantern, helmet, extra batteries, and matches. There were lanterns for rent in the gift shop as well. 	Aug 05, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-06.0703448403
Scorpion Mountain	manbe003	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were terrible	Snow free	Okay, first the good: this was a spectacularly pretty hike. There were wildflowers in bloom and excellent meadows, especially down by the lake, which I recommend adding to your trip. The mountain views were to die for.  The bad was that I could not revel in any of the beauty because the mosquitoes were the worst I have ever experienced (and I hail from Minnesota, where mosquito is the state bird). I stopped for less than 10 minutes total, just long enough to eat a granola bar and try to snap a photo, and today I have more than 50 big, nasty mosquito bites. At one point I was trying to take a selfie and saw 5 mosquitoes JUST ON MY FACE. I killed approximately 30 mosquitoes, so maybe it will be better once you get there. But please-bring some heavy-duty bug spray if you plan to stop at all. Then again, ephemeral (read: rushed) beauty is still beauty! Huckleberries are about to pop off on this hike! I got a couple-I bet they'll be in full force week after next.	Aug 05, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-06.9925914551
Skyline Trail Loop	jenkoval93	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Intermittent snow - not hard to cross	This was my first time hiking at Paradise for some reason. Boy was I surprised! I could not believe how many tourists were there at 7:30am. There were plenty of parking spaces available though. I chatted with the Ranger about the route we were taking, Skyline Trail Loop going clockwise. He suggested we take the Deadhorse Creek Trail that parallels the Skyline Trail and eventually connects with it just before Glacier Basin. Otherwise he said we would be backpack to backpack all the way up. Though we did not see many people on the Deadhorse trail, we could hear people yelling from the Skyline Trail. Yelling. And laughing very loud. Nonetheless the scenery was majestic!! Full views of Rainer, waterfalls (I saw 7), streams, lush meadows, tons of wildflowers, grouse and too many marmots and chipmunks to count. My boys loved it. The little bit of snow we had to cross was very easy. Nothing to worry about. The bugs were not too bad for a large part of the hike but were annoying around Panorama Point and the last 2 miles. I will admit we were a little low on bug spray so that could have helped. We did the full loop on the High Skyline Trail. I am glad that we chose this as our hike at Paradise because the only time we can see coming back is to do Camp Muir, at our boys' request. It was truly heartbreaking and extremely frustrating watching people go off the trail and step on thousand year old plants and display such disrespect for the Mountain and the other hikers. I'm really beside myself. I know that this beauty must be shared and I witness why people want to visit every time I hike in the park. If you are one who doesn't mind the crowds, please go. It's worth it.	Aug 05, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-06.1208451211
Deception Pass State Park - Goose Rock	Evergreen Awakening	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Goose Rock is the highest point on Whidbey Island and the Summit Trail makes a quick day hike with the promise of beautiful views! That is... if you hike it at the right time. In August, Deception Pass is prone to thick fog that persists past the lunch hour. And on the Sunday morning we chose to hike, the fog obscured pretty much any view we had. That said, there's still a magical quality to looking out at the fog and knowing that somewhere out there are spectacular mountains and lovely islands, waiting to be unveiled.  We hiked the full Goose Rock Perimeter Trail, then summited from the south. You can summit from the northeast and find a much gentler (and shaded) trail, but we chose the more challenging side. Still, even with breaks it probably only took us 20 minutes to reach the top. The top was dry as a bone with only yellow grasses to look at. However, my understanding is the widlflowers here in spring and early summer are incredibly vibrant. It was a fun and pleasant hike overall. Definitely want to come back in early spring and see all these wildflowers I hear about!

Rattlesnake Ledge	katie0537	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Set out a little late for this hike. Decided late in the evening to make this a sunset hike. Arrived at the trailhead at 7:45 and sunset was set for 8:37 so the whole hike was a race against the clock. Made it up by 8:34 just in time to see the end of the sunset.  Hike was beautiful and trail was nice and covered in trees until the end. Rocks at the top provided the perfect spot to view the sunset. Climbing down wasn’t bad. Definitely got darker faster than expected but I made good time on the way down with the constant thought of possible animals in the woods besides me.

Chain Lakes Loop	Anne	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Intermittent snow - not hard to cross	Kate, Paul, and I hiked Chain of Lakes Loop as part of the WTA Hike-a-Thon for 2018.  Flowers were outstanding!!!!  We also started from Artist’s Point and did the clockwise loop except that we started at 11:15 am.  Lots of people on the trails though it seemed to thin out as we went further along.  As reported earlier, the trail is in excellent condition.  The snowfields are late in melting out but were no hazard.  I did not encounter many bugs but I wear ExOfficio Insect Shield clothing.  This is one of my favorite trails as it has everything: lakes, mountains, and gorgeous flowers.  At 73, it is a challenging one for me, especially with all the rocky portions.  It is a long, rugged hike, so take plenty of hydration.  A photographer’s delight.

Squire Creek Pass via Eight-mile Trail	Muledeer	Obstacles on trail:	    Trees down across trail,	    Overgrown in places.	Road rough but passable	You have to be either young and strong, or old and ornery, to do this trail! It's either rocky, rooty, or both, and steep all the way. Don't be fooled by the short mileage!  I'm in the old and ornery catagory and it kicked my backside. The road  you want is Clear Creek, FS # 2060. It is tire punching rocky, go slow, there was a Prius in the parking lot tho. No loo. The trail is signed on the right. There had been some trailwork done on the first part of the trail, it is a bit rocky,  but not bad as N Cascade trails go. Once you get to the base of 3 O Clock rock (not labeled on GT maps) it goes from Dr Jeckyll to Mr Hyde. You veer to the right, don't get sidetracked into the boulder scramble  on the left like we did. This is a popular climbing route, but we didn't see any climbers. The steep sheer rock face is amazing! Once you cross the vine maple chocked avalanche slope, it's all root ladders, some blowdowns and picking your way up thru overgrown trail. I had to pick my way up slowly thru the tangle with my short legs. You will cross another short open rocky section, then you break out into the huckleberry fields, a hiker coming down saw a bear. There are some nice views out toward Sloan, Pugh, Whitechuck and the valley. The huckleberry fields seem to go on forever and steeply, I felt like a kid on a road trip, when are we going to get there? When you reach the granite slabs, watch for the cairns to guide you. Now the walking is easier on the granite. The little tarns are almost dried up. You finally reach a nice viewpoint with Three Fingers, Mt Bullion and the back of Whitehorse. I think we made it to the actual pass, as we saw some hikers coming in from the other side. There is a small goat trail going up to a saddle in the peak to the south. Ravennspirit followed for a ways, but I was done. The views were nice, but this hike did test my fitness level and I'm not sure whether I would do it again.The early wildflowers are gone, but we did see some fall daisies, the tiny flowers of rattlesnake orchid and budded gentian. On the way back down, we stopped at the waterfall and little stream and cooled off our feet. #Hikeathon Pls help the old gal:  give.wta.org/Muledeer	Aug 05, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-06.5643548478
Blanca Lake	kmwands	Minor obstacles posing few problems	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were terrible	Snow free	*You need a NW Forest Pass to hike here, or pay the daily fee This hike has been on our bucket list for some time & we decided to go for it! I would highly suggest if you're making this a day hike to start as early as possible (we started just before 10am). It took us about 3.5 hours to get from the car to the lake & much longer on the way down due to a knee issue. I'd also recommend choosing a different hike if you are knee injury prone or have shoddy ankles! Aside from the steep grade, what makes this hike challenging is the web of tree roots along the path & loose/dusty soil; all party members (including the dog!) slid a bit on the way down. Take plenty of water, for you will sweat! And remember bug spray. The flies were present but not terrible on the way up, on the way down they and the mosquitoes were almost unbearable. Definitely encourage bringing hiking poles! We took up our Blue Heeler who did great, accept with other dogs who were off leash. As noted this trail is a popular one but even with all the folks out this day we hiked alone for the most part. There were at least 30 or so people at the lake once we arrived. A few minor annoyances like one group playing dance music through a speaker & again the off leash dogs. Other than that everyone was friendly; lots of encouragement from people who were on their way down as we went up! This will most likely be a once in a lifetime hike for us; not sure my knees could handle it again! If we do it again we would either start much earlier, or make it an overnight hike. 	Aug 05, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-06.9585445326
Blanca Lake	CanvasSpots	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	This was an excellent t hike and, on a sunny day, a perfect destination. The beginning is mostly walking up the old road, which is the easiest part of the hike. If you find trouble here, turn around. After the road you’ll begin your climb up the mountain and it’s many switchbacks. Like most Cascade hikes, this will start with a rich, dense forest that slowly disappears into the timber. For those going for the first time, the trail splits a bit before the top, but both meet up at the same point. If you want an easier pass, go right which will give you supreme views of mountains and meadows. Once you reach the top you’ll know you are there. The mountain quickly flattens out and you’ll find yourself in a camper’s meadow. There is a small, dirty-looking lake that you’ll see for the first time at the highest point. From here it’s back down about one thousand feet and you’ll be at the lake! Recommend you dip your feet in the water. It’s icey cold and gets worse with depth so I don’t recommend swimming.

Denny Creek	JMZR	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Lots of people and tough to find parking on a beautiful, warm Sunday afternoon.  A pretty hike even though you're winding up Denny Creek below the Westbound trestle of I90.  Pretty easy hike for all ages.  Not much water in the Creek this time of year, but folks were enjoying the natural rock water slides and pools.

Sahale Peak	Chelan Hiker	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	This is an epic North Cascades hike, but also extremely popular and often crowded.  We were lucky to reserve camping permits for two consecutive nights at Sahale Glacier camp, which felt like we won the lottery.  The hike in is a 6-mile, 4,000 ft elevation gain puffer, and is steepest over the last 1/2-mile to the Glacier camp, but well worth the effort.  Check for ripe salmonberries and huckleberries over the first mile, and enjoy the splendid wildflowers and amazing views all the way to the Glacier camp.  Saw many goats, deer, and marmots (all were very used to humans), but only heard of a few bear sightings.  Both of our two days up top were sunny and warm, with some haze to the south as a result of the Twisp-area fires, and our evenings were wet and cold, with an impressive lightening and thunderstorm on Saturday night.  The climb up Sahale Peak is moderately technical, and there were several parties attempting the summit that were not prepared - not a good scene.  This is a gem of a hike, particularly when you are prepared for the range of conditions that await you up top.  Classic northwest!

Vesper Peak	Keith T	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were an annoyance	Snowfields to cross - could be difficult	Good challenging hike with great views! Though it was quite busy today which was a bummer. The snow is just the last part so you don't need to take spikes on and off much - just then. Bugs were pretty annoying in the lower sections but mostly respected bug spray. The trail is the same as I remember from last time, except the stream crossings are a bit easier due to logs people have put down. The bathroom is closed but as others have mentioned, the Dickerman trailhead is nearby. The forest road is pretty rough but even the low clearance ReachNow could handle it.

Marmot Pass - Upper Big Quilcene	brooke christensen	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	What a great day hike! Most people were backpacking but I decided to make it a day trip. Took the Upper Big Quilcene to Marmot Pass then summited Buckhorn Mountain. Total was 12.6 miles with 4400 elevation gain - highest point was Buckhorn Mountain at 6,996 feet.  Started the hike at 10:25am. Arrived to second campground (Camp Mystery - 4.6 miles in) at 12:25pm. Just another 0.7 miles beyond this campground, I arrived to Marmot Pass at 12:50pm. I then took a little break before heading up to Buckhorn Summit (adding 2 miles roundtrip with a +900 feet elevation gain going to the summit). I started up around 1:05pm and arrived to the top of Buckhorn around 2:05pm. I was slow and stopped for pics because the views were SO worth the trek. Left Buckhorn summit around 2:30pm and arrived to the main trailhead around 5:15pm. I stopped and took pics of the wildflowers on the way down. Also coming down that one mile from Buckhorn to Marmot Pass is extremely steep so that took a lot of time and my knees were pretty achy by the end of the hike! Great views, wildflowers were everywhere, trail was not overcrowded. Only downfall is there were approximately 2 billion flies and other flying devils at the top of Buckhorn - it was honestly super strange - they were just coating the rocks up there. Flies were annoying the entire time but mostly circled my head and didn't land on me. On the bright side no mosquito bites! 	Aug 05, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-05.8144397332
Pyramid Peak	hiker613	Obstacles on trail:	    Trees down across trail,	    Overgrown in places.	Road rough but passable	The trail description is not from parking lot described. It appears that there is a parking area from which these directions would be accurate, but it is not the from the starting location indicated.  We followed the driving directions provided. They were clear and easy to follow. The road is in good condition most of the way. The side road from the last Right is a bit rougher with some large rocks but not too bad. The parking area is quite steep and we blocked our tires with large rocks.  Starting South on the PCT hike about .8 miles to a sign indicating that you are entering an area that burned in 1988. The PCT passes through a this burned out area of meadows which has terrific views of eastward. Pyramid Peak can be seen in the distance. The PCT then passes through an area of old growth and eventually you reach a saddle. At this point our GPS said there was a trail to the summit of Pyramid Peak but we were unable to locate any trail. We continued on the PCT which makes for great hiking with nice views of Mt. Rainier through the trees. At 3.3 miles from the TH there is a trail to the left. There is a sign indicating this is the trail to Pyramid Peak (though its facing the opposite way). This trail appears lightly used but route finding is not required if you pay attention. There are a few fallen trees but they are easily managed, as well as a few areas of loose rock on the trail and some brushy areas. At .7 miles from the PCT you reach the former lookout site and the views are stunning. In total the hike is 8 miles round trip from the parking area described. 	Aug 05, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-05.5947886002

Icicle Gorge Nature Loop	crilski	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	A nice little loop!  The road is quite washboardy and dusty (go sloooowwww by the ranger station, mind your dust!) but the trail is in excellent condition.  I'm an entomologist and I have a high tolerance for insects, but the blackflies are annoying! If you hike at a decent pace they aren't too bad.  There's a $5 day use fee in addition to your Northwest Forest Pass. Ample parking.  Found a great place to cliff jump into the icicle at the west end of the loop! So refreshing. This is such a gentle smooth trail, great for children or newer hikers. Beautiful bridges and features. 	Aug 05, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-05.8781288003
Mount Pilchuck	amysbubble	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	The road leading up to the trailhead is filled with potholes, some of a significant size.  We slowed accordingly in our compact Toyota and arrived at the trailhead around 9:45 in the morning. The day was beautiful. We liberally applied bug spray on ourselves initially and were therefore rarely bothered by flies and mosquitos that hummed along the trail.  The views on the way up to the lookout tower were magnificent and especially so when we finally reached it - not without a lot of sweat and scramblings, of course!  Last climb up to the lookout tower was grinding but well worthy it - we were afforded a 360 degree panoramic view from the tower, highlighted by the bald eagle flying atop the faraway ridge. After about half hour lingering at the top, we started making our way down - do tread with care as I did almost slip a couple of times on the rugged rocky slope.   We reached back down around 2:15 - still seeing cars streaming in.  I will definitely hike Pilchuck again like we had done many times since we moved back to Seattle - just can’t seem to get enough of its coveted prize of sublime natural beauty.

Gold Creek - Alaska Lake	Audrea11	Obstacles on trail:	    .	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were terrible	The hike on the gold creek trail was mild and fun. My husband and I took two first time backpackers on it. The bugs were annoying but otherwise a great easy start.  We decided to push on to Alaska lake to camp since it wasn’t too much farther. The bugs at this point were relentless and the trail to Alaska lake was pretty rough. We made it to the lake but we had to go super slow through a lot of overgrown brush.  Alaska lake was beautiful and our camp was quiet and serene. We only saw one other group of campers there. On the way down, the alpine meadow was filled with flowers and butterflies.  Would’ve been an awesome trip if not for the bugs. Even with jungle juice slathered on, all 4 of us are covered in bites.

Crystal Lakes	Juleeamarie	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	Arrived at parking lot at 945a and the lot was almost full. The trail was a chilly and wet as it rained the night before. There is one small area on the trail that’s has a beautiful view of rainier. We got to the lake at 11:15a and had lunch and relaxed by the water. The water was surprisingly warm and crystal clear. The flies were pretty annoying at the lake. Most buzzing but we did get a few bites as well. We headed back down at 1:15p and got to the car at 2:30p. We saw about 5 groups with dogs which I found shocking since there are no dogs allowed on this trail.	Aug 05, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-05.6586850326
Hog Canyon Lake	MattOStephens	Minor obstacles posing few problems	Road rough but passable	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	     This trip was my 3rd trip to Hog lake, and it was a good hike.  I do recommend for people to hike the area earlier in the season, because during the summer months the waterfall is dry, and the water level of the lake was pretty low as well.  The waterfall is probably the most interesting feature about this hike, but people should go during or shortly after the snow melt to see the massive waterfall in action.  The trails have been pretty well maintained each time I have visited, although this trip there was some overgrown bushes blocking parts of the trail.  They were easy to go around so it didn't really introduce any problems, however the insects were a bit of an issue.       Different bugs were out in abundance, such as the dragonflies that were dancing around the water's edge.  I was stung twice during this hike, and the first one was a pretty good one.  It was either a nasty wasp or hornet, so hikers should have some kind of protection from those.  There were also an abundance of grasshoppers, and they were literally all over the fields above Hog Lake.  As far as wildlife goes I saw two eagles possibly, but they were kind of far off so I am not sure exactly what type.  There were also some snakes in the taller grass along some of the trails, so be cautious of that.      Overall, the road and trail conditions were relatively rough but passable, and it was extremely hot out in the open fields.  The patches of shade did provide some comfort during the hike, and it is best to hike the area in the morning or evening during the Summer months in order to avoid the hottest parts of the day.  I do highly recommend this area, as it has become a spot I visit every couple of months.  The hiking isn't too tough, but has some steep parts that lead to pretty nice views.  Make sure to stay safe and keep hiking strong!!    	Aug 05, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-05.1071486951
Butte Camp	BeaverDawg	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	We hiked to Butte Camp via the Toutle Trail this morning.  The trail is in great condition, bugs were present, mainly bees maybe some flies, but no mosquitoes and no bites.  We've done the trail a few times previously, up to the Loowit, but today we planned to just go to Butte Camp so we would have time to explore a new-to-us trail, after this hike.  The spring at Butte Camp is running sufficiently, there was just one tent when we came through in the morning.  On the way in we only saw the couple and toddler who were starting out at the same time as us. On the way out we passed 8 people, and there were two couples at the trailhead preparing to begin.   All in all it was a nice morning hike with little traffic.

Josephine Lake	Ups n Downs	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	It took a while for my hiking mojo to kick in today, in fact it took everything I had to convince myself I'd regret not going.  I slept an extra hour after my 4AM alarm, traded Rainier for Stevens Pass and Lake Janus for Josephine when I was about half way there. The trail is in excellent shape and the grade is easy.  The scenery up the ski slopes is average and the morning haze cancelled out the views.  The decent from the top lift is exposed and crosses under a power line swath that made me second guess my choice.  Once past the powelines though the scenery improves and Lake Susan Jane is a gem.  ( Side note: There's a road that reaches where the PCT crosses under the powerlines and a few trucks were parked above the crossing.  Assuming it's open to all vehicles the trail from here to Lake Susan Jane is roughly two miles round-trip with very mininmal elevation gain making it a great kid hike.  Judging by the number of anglers the fishing is good as well.)  From there it's about a long half mile to the Icicle Creek trail junction.  I didn't feel compelled to go all the way to the lake so I went right and after a short distance as the trail bends left you'll find a nice rock to sit and enjoy the view. I saw no one on the trail going in but quite a few coming out.  I was disappointed that the person who drank the Red Bull didn't get enough energy to pack out the can.

Goat Lake	Grokking	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Great hike for all but the most beginning hikers that might want to avoid a gentle elevation gain of 1,400 feet. Lots of diversity on the trail, although it does seem everyone is younger than me these days. The description of this trail by the WTA correspondent is quite accurate, and so I won't go on to tell you much about what to expect on this hike. I do agree that taking the upper and lower Elliott alternately is the way to go -- why would you want to cover the same ground twice? That said, I do want to emphasize the waterfall. To me and my hiking companion, it was what made the hike. The lake was pale by comparison, and it's a nice lake in a valley (possibly named Elliott) below a mountain top 2400' to the southwest. It really is a series of waterfalls that begins just below the lake, cascading down pool by pool, nooks and crannies aplenty to wind the water, whirling, gushing, leaping, from one set of rocks to another. At some point as you are watching it dance down the creek you see the water stop moving but it starts again as soon as you do. It drops about 200 feet when it reaches the spot for adventurers mentioned in the WTA description. My photo looks back up the creek from there. From this perspective, one appreciates Bruce Lee's call for us to be water. Well worth the drive and the occasional biting fly.

Longs Pass	margo	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	August 10, 2018 Longs Pass, Stuart Pass and Lake Ingalls Over the past 20 years I have regularly hiked the Lake Ingalls trail. It is (was?) my favorite hike. The drive is about 2 hours from Seattle, the last 45 minutes through beautiful eastern Washington pine forest. The last 10 miles is a washboard dirt road where one can glimpse car park campers and a few federal cabins leased for nothing. In order to park at the trailhead parking lot one must arrive by 7:00 am. Nine years ago, several friends and I backpacked to Lake Ingalls. We hiked a clockwise path: Lake Ingalls, around the lake, along Ingalls Creek, then up to Longs Pass. It was a two-night camping expedition. We camped short of Lake Ingalls, then hiked to the lake the next day and then down the Ingalls Creek trail to point where the creek meets the trail up to Longs Pass. We camped at the creek. The trail to Longs Pass rises southerly 1,500 feet in 1.1 miles, with no switchbacks and a lot of scree and scrambling. The last 100 feet or so are really treacherous. It is, however, a popular trail for mountain climbers who ascend Mt. Stuart. All I really remember from that trip was the difficult passage along the western edge of  Lake Ingalls and the southern ascent to Longs Pass (more on this later). This past weekend I decided to hike the same trail but in the opposite (counterclockwise) direction. My purpose was to test my backpacking equipment as well as my physical ability. I really had forgotten how difficult this trail was. I did carry a declinated compass, map, and Garmin GPS. I arrived at the trailhead parking lot on Sunday morning but had to park along the road. The parking lot was completely full. I spent my time arranging everything in my backpack, etc. Then off I went. The first .4 miles of the trail follows the North Teanaway. Then it splits off: to the left is the Esmeralda Basin trail and to the right the Lake Ingalls trail. No where does the sign indicate that to the right is the way to Lake Ingalls, it just shows the trail number – I guess to keep it secret. Another 2 miles up the trail it splits again, to the left is the Lake Ingalls trail and to the right Longs Pass. The Longs Pass trail gains elevation very quickly. It’s not so hard, but it is steep with switchbacks. I made it to the top in decent time. Then I looked down to where I had to go next. Straight down. 1,500 feet in 1.1 miles. No switchbacks. Lots of scree and loose rocks. Another hiker advised me on the different routes I could take going down. I opted for the main trail if one could describe it as such. I don’t know whether this was a good idea or not. But what happened next was so scary I prayed very loud to God hoping I would survive. I had to hang on to rocks with my finger tips. The distance between where my foot was and where I would place the next foot was longer than I could stretch. I wasn’t sure what to do with my hiking sticks since I needed my hands (fingers, actually) to hang on to the rocks. I should have been exercising my triceps for months before this trip, as well as my quads. I was terrified. I looked down at the trail and I could see I wouldn’t have much more distance to hang on to any rocks because there weren’t any to hang on to. But there were plenty on the ground. The trail went in a straight line through loose rock until I reached Ingalls Creek. I slipped a lot and used my poles to catch myself. I then had to ford the creek and find the Ingalls Creek Trail. Again, no signs letting me know which way to go until I reached the junction of the Ingalls Creek Trail and the end of the trail from Longs Pass. At this point I was pretty tired, hot, and sweaty. I had another 3 miles to go to Stuart Pass. It was all uphill. I had to stop every 10 minutes to rest. It was hot. After three hours I decided I would have to find a place to pitch my tent. I saw one MSR tent which looked like 5 people could sleep in. Lucky for me, a place materialized near a brook and a pretty meadow full of wildflowers in bloom; this is where I set up my tent. I noticed a lot of scat from what animal I know not, but I knew I was going to have to hang a food sack up high. It took 10 tries throwing a rock on a rope before I was successful. I never saw nor heard any animals the entire time I was hiking or sleeping. That night was cloudless. I got out of the tent several times just to look up at the stars. There are millions and billions of them. There’s no light pollution up in the mountains. I was hoping to see a meteor shower, but no such luck. I did see and hear airplanes (about every 30 minutes). The next morning I continued hiking along the Ingalls Creek Trail. There were some cairns to lead the way through the rocks, but there were two which were definitely misplaced. Not sure why. Anyway, this was the first of my getting off trail. As I walked up to the pass I noticed one little side trail (unmarked) which didn’t look heavily used so I walked on. When I reached Stuart Pass there was a large map of the area north of where I was standing which had a large-lettered sign warning hikers not to camp in the Alpine Lakes area. There were two directional signs: one to Ingalls Creek (which I had just come from) and another to Jack Creek. I didn’t see any trail leading to Lake Ingalls. I wandered around a bit and then took a rest. Then I noticed a trail with no signage but it looked like the one I wanted to use to go to Lake Ingalls (heading west). I hiked along this trail for about 45 minutes. Sometimes the trail disappeared where there was a rock outcropping but I could see a faint trail further on so I would carefully make my way across the rocks. After 45 minutes I reached a place where there just was no trail. Usually when this happens I look for other boot prints. I then realized I hadn’t seen any boot prints on this trail. I got out my Garmin and sure enough, it showed that I was about 500 feet above the trail I wanted. So I back tracked. I realized now that the little trail off the Ingalls Creek trail which I had passed earlier was the trail I wanted. I hiked back down to it. This trail wasn’t so bad and there were boot prints so I knew I was going in the right direction. What was beginning to bother me the most was that I had seen no one else while I was hiking. Had I taken a wrong step and twisted an ankle or broken a leg, no one would have known where to find me. One thing about Lake Ingalls which is now imprinted on my brain is that no matter whether you approach from the north or the south, about 100 yards before you reach the lake it’s a tangle of rocks, cairns and some faint trail. At the top I knew I was almost there, but really, how was I going to get up high enough to find the lake. I realized it was going to be the same scramble as the southern approach: steep and very rocky. But I did make it. I thought to myself, home free. All I have to do is go around the lake, sit at the lake to enjoy it and make my way down the Lake Ingalls trail. What I had forgotten from 9 years ago is that getting from the north end of the lake to the south end is just as treacherous as getting to the lake itself. Yes, there was a path but it was intermittently blocked by car-sized boulders. Not just one boulder, 15 or more boulders and I had to figure out which boulder to scramble up first. I think it took me one hour to walk the shore. I was tempted to swim but was afraid my backpack would cause me to sink to the bottom. If the shore had been shallow, I would have walked, but the water was deep all along the shore. I finally made enough progress that I had only about 25 yards to go, but there were still all these boulders. A couple had climbed over these to have their own space at the lake and told me how to finish. Whew! I made it to the south shore of the lake. I have hiked to Lake Ingalls multiple times over the past 20 years, and almost without exception I will strip down to my top and shorts and jump in. This time, I was too tired, but certainly hot enough. Finally, at 13:30 I decided I should get moving because I I didn’t want to spend another night camping. Actually, I would have but Bill (my husband) would have been so concerned he would have called the forest ranger. I started down. As I mentioned earlier, the ascent/descent to Lake Ingalls at the very top is not easy. It’s steep and it’s rocky. There are cairns you need to follow. Once I lost track of the cairns and thought I was on the trail only to be blocked by huge rocks. Again, the Garmin showed I was off trail. I back tracked. Fortunately, by this time, there were a number of other hikers, so I waited to see which way they went. Then I saw the cairn I had missed and the trail below. This was the last time on this trip where I lost my way. I did have to stop to rest more than I wanted, but by the time I reached the Longs Pass junction, I knew I would make it to the parking lot, and I did. 50 minutes to hike 2.5 miles. I impressed myself. The first thing I did after reaching the parking lot was to remove my boots, put on my sandals and go to the ice cold Teanaway to cool off. Boy, it felt great to jump in that cold creek.	Aug 05, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-10.9587960655
Carter Falls	ATripp	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	I spent Sunday, August 5, celebrating my birthday and #hikeathon by asking friends and family to do trail work at Mount Rainier.  Our project location changed at the last moment and we found ourselves on this lovely section of the Wonderland Trail. On a non-trail work day, I would recommend (if you have access to two cars) parking one at either Cougar Rock Picnic Area or Longmire (depending on your preferred distance) and the other at the Narada Falls trailhead and hiking this trail one way. I'd personally go mostly uphill (ending at Narada), but I realize that's not the preference of everyone! Our crew leader, Hannah, wrote to us afterwards to say a little bit about this section of trail and the work WTA has done this summer that I think is worth noting here: "	Aug 05, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-09.2036977615

Peshastin Pinnacles	Krishna	Minor obstacles posing few problems	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Don't get confused by the signage. They had three different signs that say the state park is 1/2 mile ahead - One was placed correctly but the other two (facing each direction on Hwy 2) say 1/2 mile ahead when you are supposed to turn right there. Also check the state park timings to make sure it is open when you get there. It's a short hike but the trail is washed out in places and there are false trails all over the place - make sure you follow the main trail. You will see nice views of the Wenatchee river and the surrounding orchards. The rock formations themselves are quite beautiful. It's an awesome spot for rock climbing!

Mount Adams South Climb	Sarah Renee	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Trail snow-covered at times - gear and expertise recommended	My friend and I undertook a RT day-hike. Sunrise to summit about 12 hrs.  We grabbed our passes at the station in town (24 hr. drop-in cash payment/permit access) before heading to the service road which leads to the South Climb TH (road was not dusty due rain/thunderstorm that had just passed through the area). Upon arrival at the parking lot (about 10:00 pm Saturday) we noticed there was still room to park but it was almost full. Stars were brilliant due to a very late moon-rise. We settled down into the car to sleep about 11:30 pm.  Woke up at 4 am on Sunday; at the trail by 4:50. Experienced friends of ours confirmed that the use of an ice axe was not necessary so I packed... micro spikes (my friend packed cramp-ons), trekking poles, sun-glasses, sun-block, insulated gloves, meds (incl. electrolyte tabs, ibu profen, anti-nausea), water filtration etc. Sunglasses are absolutely necessary, poles and spikes necessary bug spray rather useless and the bugs were not an annoyance. You will also want sunblock and SPF chap stick. I forgot to pack gaiters but only found them useful for glissading down later in the day (changing into an extra pair of socks at the end fixed this). Layers included one down jacket for the early morning, one pair of light fast-drying pants, waterproof hiking boots, one fleece and one base-layer. I wore the base layer for the latter 70% of the trip.  There were two other sets of hikers invigorated enough to head up before sunrise. No sunlight for a few hours, head-lamps did the trick and ground is mostly flat for the first leg. The weather was fair starting at the base of the ascent around 40 degrees and increasing to a max of mid 60s throughout the day. We passed a couple of men heading opposite direction to the TH just before sunrise around the 2nd mile of the trail who reported that they weren't able to ascend on Saturday due to a storm and due to the fact that before the storm set in the snow was too soft to trek through. On our way up it had clearly hailed and snowed the night before which hardened/packed the snow enough for traversing so this did not hinder our trip (if anything, parts of snow were particularly hard to dig into). Bottom layer of the trail is a dirt path once forested but a major fire has wiped out trees for miles. There are some remaining trees but not many; a lot of new growth allowed for plenty of wildflowers including lupin, paint-brush, daisies bear grass etc.From here the trail progresses into a more rocky terrain rising up a bit over small boulder fields. Stepping isn't difficult and markers are visible from one to the next.  Before you reach the snow fields there are campers along dirt and rock paths. Camp areas are very nice with flat ground and several layers of rock wall barriers (made by trail builders) to escape the wind force. Trail is clearly marked through this except for two official signs that read "South Climb and Trail" pointing in the opposite direction of the actual trail. Follow the Cairns and wooden poles and you will be fine. There are plenty of people along this route by the time the sun is up that you should have no problem mapping it out.  A small stream in this area allows for water filtration but we were already carrying about 5 liters between the two of us and planned to filter near the top or boil snow when we needed more. There is a lot of wind starting at the 3rd mile of the trail and increasing rock/boulder crossing that does not require scrambling and is pretty tame. The wind did not persist as we went higher throughout the day. Upon reaching the first snowfield about three miles in you will need your spikes and poles. From here to the summit it is mostly snow crossing and alternating short breaks between several strides to adjust to the elevation gain (6,700 ft over 6 miles if rising to the peak at 12,200 ft). The 'lunch counter' is where most people will take a 10 min. break to re-adjust gear, boil water or eat.This is also pretty easy to navigate as far as trail-finding is concerned. Many foot and spike prints will help you figure it out. We did not find that an ice axe would have been useful for these conditions. The snow was pretty stable though on a steep gradient at times. As long as you are digging in with spikes and poles you should not worry. We alternated progress with another group of hikers who did not have spikes, only poles. Though they made it to the top I would not recommend this.  There is one true false peak before reaching the top. At this point it gets particularly hard to control breathing so you have to go slow and take short breaks to let your heart and breath recover. There is one descending snowfield before a rise on an exposed and muddy dirt path to the false peak. The ground here was very soft and you had to trudge through so extra force was required to make progress. Some used their spikes here, it was soft enough but I took mine off and put them back on after. Before the last push there is a small but crystal clear glacial river partly exposed and you can get fresh water here. Drinking a lot of water from beginning to end on this trip will be key to endurance and altitude recovery. Overall you need at -least- 6 liters between two people. I recommend 7 to 8 or filtering to your needs throughout.  We reached summit at about 1pm. It was nice to have a beer here and take in the moment. Without a doubt worth the difficulty.  Return: Glissading down the first drop is at-risk based on your knowledge of how to arrest with poles or an ice axe. This first part is the only point at which I would have found an axe useful. I went down the chute with one trekking pole (should have used two) at side and was not prepared for the velocity of the gradient and went slightly airborne at an uncontrollable speed and so began dragging my arms in panic  through the snow walls and developing a nice rash and a few cuts on both arms through the base layer I wore. At a point it could have gone badly but a passing hiker was able to grab me on their way up and help me control speed enough to stop. This was due to my inexperience and lack of proper self-assessment. Proceed with caution. After this I had no problem and every path for sliding was safe. Near the end of the fields your bum will really hurt if you don't have a garbage bag or some form of protection underneath. You can glissade all the way down to the rock field signaling the beginning of the end of your return trip.  Our speed was slightly faster than the average of most but not the fastest. As far as endurance goes this is an unforgiving climb meant for well experienced (stubborn) hikers if doing it in one day. We had perfect weather conditions with only cloud-cover moving through the snow fields and decreasing visibility for 5 min. at a time. I would not attempt this climb if there is any possibility of a storm or gale-force winds. Many people we saw on the way up did not reach the summit but there were others who struggled and willed their way to the top. Take your time at your pace and be mindful of your daylight and body signals. The rest of the way down was a breeze. Return trip is a fraction of time compared to the ascent. It was hot AF back at the trail-head.  Put this stratovolcano on your PNW bucket-list. 	Aug 05, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-06.6895974315
Shadow Lake - Sunrise Camp Loop	jenersoz	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Finding the trail head proved to be a bit of a challenge. We walked through the picnic area and I think got lucky and ran into the trail.  We were not the only hiker not sure of were the trail started. However once we were on the trail it was a superbly beautiful and fun hike.  The trail is mostly wide enough to walk side by side.  	Aug 05, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-06.8661336111
Colchuck Lake	ToddlerTrekking	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	We tackled Colchuck Lake for the first time on Sunday. The trailhead was already full and people were parking down the road when we arrived at 8:30 am. Some cars were parking in ways that would prevent other cars from getting out of their spots, please don't do this. The single pit toilet is in desperate need of cleaning! Please don't trash pit toilets, yuck. By the end of the day it was also out of TP. On to the trail, it was long and strenuous. It took me six hours to reach the lake. Yes, I was the slowest one on the mountain but be aware that if you are not used to sprinting up 2,000+ feet every weekend, it may be a rocky slog. We made it back out just before dark. I recommend poles and LOTS of fluids. It is a dry, dusty, and rocky trail. Bring the bug juice!!! The flies were bad. My clothing was pretreated and I put 30% deet on my skin and hair but they still found ways to find a crack in the armor and seemed to be obsessed with getting in my ears and nose. Yuck! There was a bit of wildfire smoke drifting in but never anything severe. Three of us in the group have Asthma and did fine with it. The various creeks along the way are lovely with no difficult crossings. Yes the lake is beautiful, but honestly I did not have a religious experience upon seeing it. I'm still glad I made it up there and it was definitely a challenge! I got to talk with lots of hikers, climbers, and backpackers about Washington Trails Association and Hike-A-Thon on the hike. It was great to meet everyone! This summer, my four-year-old son and I are hiking to raise money for Washington Trails Association. Please consider donating to one of our Hike-A-Thons at the below links.

Blanca Lake	sierrajade	Minor obstacles posing few problems	Road impassable/closed	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	We got to the gate at 4:30 am and to the trail head by 5 am. The switch backs began easier and shorter and progressively got more difficult and longer. There are a lot of roots and loose dirt along the path. On the way back down I almost tripped a couple times. We got to the lake a before 9 am and we were the first ones there. More people began trickling in around 10 am. I definitely recommend an early morning hike. We spoke with the ranger that was out and she said she counts the amount of people she sees every day and it is usually around 200. I swam in the lake. It was super cold but after a couple minutes it was ok, a nice refresher after the hike. The sun was out so I was able to dry off pretty quickly. On the way back down it took us 2 hours. The bugs were only bad once reaching halfway down the trail but particularly bad on the gravel road back to the parking area. I would recommend boots with good ankle support and poles.

Thunder Knob	Jenn27549	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Decided to tack on this hike after a morning of paddling the lake, to make the long drive from Seattle a bit more worthwhile. This was my second time at Diablo, parking at the Colonial Creek Campground to use the boat launch there. Was not nearly as busy as the previous time (late June), there was parking (not ample, but available) the whole time I was there from 8:30-2:30. I will say traffic was heavy leaving the park in the afternoon, and the drive back took a full 45 minutes longer than the drive in, so keep that in mind if you're trying to make it back to the city by a certain time.  Started up at 12:30, reached the top about 1:15, rested and snacked for about 20 mins, and was back to my car a little after 2:00. I went at a moderately fast pace, stopping to take pics. The start of the trail is rocky (large gravel) and hard to find at first, but once you cross the bridge leaving the campsites the trail is easy to follow from there, and mostly dirt with few rocks/obstacles. Plenty of places to stop and rest on the way, up as well. Trail is mostly OPEN and not shaded so it was a hot one, definitely don't forget sunscreen. It's not too steep or long, though, so that was a benefit given the temps. Not very busy either, which was nice. I passed other hiking groups once every 10 minutes, max. Some flies and other bugs, but not as many as expected. Bug spray still recommended if bugs tend to like you. Certainly recommend if you want a short, not too strenuous hike in the area with GREAT views. The view of the lake isn't as good as the main Diablo Lake trail but they are still worthwhile given the trail is half as long, and the views of all the surrounding peaks are excellent, at multiple points both up and down.   Final random note--I stopped to splash my face and head at the end, to rinse off sweat/sunscreen/bug spray and to cool down in the stream right as you re-enter the campground. Once my hair dried in the car, it was so unbelievably soft. I don't know what's in that water, but ladies (and guys) I recommend sticking your head in it ;) 	Aug 05, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-06.8422399862
Lake Ingalls	SwissHill	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Gorgeous day hike up to Ingalls Lake!  We slept at the trailhead and then got an early start up trail 1390. The majority of the trail is very navigable until the trail splits into 1390.1 and 1390.2. From there it is less obvious and easier to lose your way. We ended up scrambling over some big/huge boulders only to find the trail went on above us. We met others on the trail having difficulty finding their way which in the end actually will damage more by people going off trail so it would be nice to have good markers on such a heavily used trail. Also, if you are out there and see signs that say "Closed for Restoration" please respect that! We saw a hammock hanging in an area clearly marked closed for restoration.  There were not too many bugs about but I did get 3 mosquito bites. The trail was quite clear of garbage and only saw one toilet paper pile about 3 ft off trail. Ew.  The road to the trailhead was easy in our Prius, just washboard and there is a privy at the trailhead. 	Aug 05, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-06.1920268290
Gothic Basin	tiffanyc	Obstacles on trail:	    Trees down across trail,	    Difficult stream crossing(s),	    Muddy or wet trail.	Got to the trailhead around 10:00 on a bright Sunday morning to cars parked all along the Mountain Loop near the trailhead, although we easily found a spot for our car. We had stayed at the Bedal Campground the night before, after having done   the previous day (yes, we might be certifiably insane, or just very masochistic).  The trail is in pretty good condition, except for a few downed trees that are slightly annoying to climb over, some muddy spots, and some larger creek/waterfall crossings. The hike starts out very mild, under heavy tree cover, then transitions into an incredibly steep part that is unrelenting. I have to echo the sentiment others have already --   underestimate this hike because the stats make it seem relatively moderate. It's tough.  The steepness doesn't really let up at all beyond this point. The tree cover disappears after a while, and you're basically hiking on the side of the mountain, which is  ; such clear views of the surrounding mountains! There are a few creek crossings here that can be slightly difficult to navigate, but I made it through all of them with my trail runners without getting my feet wet. There are wildflowers all along this part of the trail, but also plenty of bugs -- bring bug spray!  Once you're getting closer to the Basin, you'll end up scaling some rock faces.  .  We saw a hiker coming down when ascending with bandages all over his arm and head moving very slowly while being assisted by about 4 other people, and from what I understand, he had fallen and injured himself while scrambling up the wet rocks. Luckily, the rock faces you have to scramble up are not very long sections at a time.  Took us about 2:30 to get to the Basin. Sat around for a bit, then decided to head up to Foggy Lake. It's pretty steep, and it took us around 30 minutes to get up there. Still a bit frozen over, and definitely worth the extra elevation gain/mileage! The views of the Basin up there are pretty great too. From Foggy Lake, it took us about 2:30 to get back down, due to the slowness that comes from descending down really steep rocks/trail. 	Aug 05, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-05.9733881636
Little Si	ehtesh	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Great trail. Last time I hiked this, it was in the winter with a lot of snow. It's very clear during the summer and the middle 3 miles helped stay cool, probably 10 degrees less than the 85 degree weather at the bottom and top. Would recommend this hike to newcomers. It's a lot of incline but well worth it.	Aug 05, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-05.1771247689
Granite Mountain	moutain_vagabond	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were terrible	Snow free	Started the hike at 5:30 am on a Sunday because: 1) Only way to beat the crowds on a weekend. 2) Much cooler temperatures while hiking up before the mid-day heat starts (and it was a fairly hot day). Parking lot was about half full when I reached and not surprisingly, was completely packed by the time I got down and cars were parked on the side of the road all the way about half a mile from the parking lot (Justifying the early start). Crossed just one person on my way up (he seemed to have started in the dark) and a lot more people on the way down as expected. First person to reach the look out and had the look out to myself for about 15 minutes before a few more people showed up.Trail is in perfectly good condition and completely snow free. It's a difficult hike as has been stated though the elevation gain is actually fairly gradual so that helped in both adjusting to the elevation gain as well as saving my knees. It starts up steep, gets steeper, then gets slightly less steep (but still steep) before you reach an open valley with the lookout (and the granite rocks) in front of you. From here the trail goes right and climbs down for a bit before the final push to the look out begins. This is the steepest section though it doesn't really last all that long. The lookout is closed due to reconstruction. It was a smoky morning and most of the views were enveloped in a cloud of haze (smoke) from the recent fires. You could make out a barely visible Mount Rainier through all the smoke. Still a great work out and a beautiful morning in the mountains. It was a lot hotter on the way down so I was really glad I started this hike as early as I did when the temperature was in the 50's and 60's. People coming up while I was going down looked like they were exhausted and having a lot less fun than when I was climbing up. Oh and the bugs at the top are terrible. I got bitten and hounded by them so insect repellant strong advised.	Aug 05, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-05.6014769206
Anderson and Watson Lakes	MaggieMay	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	Beautiful day with the wildflowers starting to bloom. We saw some green berries, nothing ripe yet.  Trail clear, with a couple downed trees blocking the path. Busy day with lots of backpackers at Anderson lake. Creeks are still running in the Meadows.

Blanca Lake	sierrajade	Minor obstacles posing few problems	Road impassable/closed	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	We got to the gate at 4:30 am and to the trail head by 5 am. The switch backs began easier and shorter and progressively got more difficult and longer. There are a lot of roots and loose dirt along the path. On the way back down I almost tripped a couple times. We got to the lake a before 9 am and we were the first ones there. More people began trickling in around 10 am. I definitely recommend an early morning hike. We spoke with the ranger that was out and she said she counts the amount of people she sees every day and it is usually around 200. I swam in the lake. It was super cold but after a couple minutes it was ok, a nice refresher after the hike. The sun was out so I was able to dry off pretty quickly. On the way back down it took us 2 hours. The bugs were only bad once reaching halfway down the trail but particularly bad on the gravel road back to the parking area. I would recommend boots with good ankle support and poles.

Thunder Knob	Jenn27549	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Decided to tack on this hike after a morning of paddling the lake, to make the long drive from Seattle a bit more worthwhile.

Comet Falls	chuck	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Arrived at the trailhead a little before 7am and for the next 3 hours and 15 minutes I never saw another hiker. I have done Van Trump a few times so this time I skipped it and went on to Mildred point. Once I passed the creek heading to Mildred I came up on a small doe and buck working their way across a meadow. On the return trip to the creek the Marmot were out in full force tanning and having a late breakfast of tasty flowers. The Marmot had no idea I was there so I just sat down and watched. When I got back to my car at 11:15 and drove out of the park the line trying to get in was over a mile long. Getting up early paid off.        	Aug 05, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-05.5612271969

Vesper Peak	stual@uw.edu	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snowfields to cross - could be difficult	My bro bro from highschool and I made a run up Vesper looking for a doable day trip from seattle that had some suffering, sweat, and some snow travel. Vesper delivered like Lebron James in the 4th. We left seattle at 530 and arrived at the trailhead at 730, you can just put NF-4065 into google maps and it will deliver you to the promised land. Snow before the top is doable in boots but we brought ice axe/crampons and were comfortable. 3.5 hours up, 2.5 hours down was very manageable. All in all this is a great short day peak within striking distance of seattle that has easy route finding and some fun snow travel at the top. 	Aug 05, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-05.9433354280
Talapus and Olallie Lakes	fromseatosummit	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	I anticipated mosquitos on this hike after reading the last few trip reports, but honestly, the mosquitos stayed away 90% of the time at the lake.  There was a slight breeze, so that must have been it, but I also had on bug spray, and had a deet fan on. Fairly gradual incline with a few steep moments, and a few flat moments.  The couple of bridge crossings were tilted, and that messed with my balance a little bit.   Nine in the morning seemed like the best time to take photos as the sun wasn't casting shadows on anything, and the colors were bold.  Also, try getting to the trailhead before 8:30-9am because the parking was full, and I parked just 200 feet on the side of the road near the trailhead.

Wonderland Trail	Stuke Sowle	Minor obstacles posing few problems	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Intermittent snow - not hard to cross	I wanted to get WTA’s hike-a-thon off to a proper start and what better way to do so then by taking a trip around the most iconic feature of our state, Tahoma.      I have done two loops around the mountain before, both counterclockwise, taking three days and two days.  For this trip I wanted an even more unique and challenging experience and decided I wanted to do the loop in one push.  I also added a trip up to second Burroughs as an alternate to dropping down to White River to start the trip.    Because something like this could turn into a novel, I am going to stick with describing mostly the trail conditions on this report.  I started at Sunrise for a couple of reasons, one the section between Sunrise and Longmire has some of my favorite stretches that I wanted to ensure were in the daylight.  Second, it allowed me to hit the gift shop at Longmire for more food before it closed as well as cache some food at Mowich before hitting the final leg of the journey.     I hit the trail at 5:00 AM under cloudy skies.  The forecast had called for a slight chance of rain with just trace accumulation so I was optimistic the clouds would burn off as the day continued.  I took the service road behind the Sunrise visitor center to the Wonderland and then hopped onto the Burroughs trail at its intersection with the Wonderland.  As I climbed up first Burroughs, I would get glimpses of a glowing moon and had a feeling that I would get high enough on second Burroughs to break out of the clouds.  I was a bit surprised that this early in August there wasn’t a single patch of snow to cross all the way to Burroughs, but it has been pretty warm.   My decision to make this alternate start paid off as I broke above the clouds in time to catch alpenglow on Tahoma from the rising sun.  I had the mountain to myself and savored this incredible beginning to the journey.  From there I dropped down the Sunrise Trail towards Glacier Basin, admiring the views before I finally sank into the clouds again.  While this adds extra mileage, without a doubt in my mind, it is a better section of trail to cover than just dropping down from Sunrise on the Wonderland.  Both Sunrise Trail and Glacier Basin Trail are in excellent condition.  Wildflowers are still out but peak season is definitely over. At the White River Campground, I hopped back onto the Wonderland and headed for Summerland.  Even this early in the morning, the White River was within splashing distance of the bridge and on the sign on the far side of the river, there was posted a warning about avoiding this crossing on hot days later in the day as the meltwater apparently was driving the river over the bridge.   The trail to Summerland is snow free, in great shape and had some wildflowers hanging in there.  The colder temps in the morning meant no bugs to deal with.     From Summerland to right below Panhandle Gap is snow free already.  The bridge is now up as well.  I found the trail past the bridge to be well marked and even first time travelers should have no problems through this section.  To get to Panhandle Gap, I had to make about 10 steps across snow.  I found the exposure minimal and no need for traction devices.  Once at the gap, the sporadic clouds became not so sporadic, and a light mist began to fall.  Unfortunately this would continue for the next few hours on the amazing section between Panhandle Gap and Cowlitz Divide.    After Panhandle Gap I expected a lot of lingering snow but for the most part, this section is melted out with just a handful of snowfields left to cross.  Most of them very short.  The bootpack on one snowfield went right over a section of undercut snow where you could even see where someone had punched through.  I avoided this easily by dropping down below the snowfield and rock hopping across the creek creating the undercut snow.  Even in the fog and mist, the route was easy to follow with cairns and flagging marking the way.  Once you begin the steep drop to Indian Haven you leave the snow behind.      While this is one of the most beautiful sections of the trail, the trail itself is one of my least favorite sections as I find no matter how easy I take it, the steps are a jarring experience.  With the soaring views blocked, my attention was placed on the smaller details of the trail through here.  Flowers, dew drops on the leaves, and the dozens of smaller waterfalls dotting the landscape.  I had the pleasure of a few close moments with two herds of mountain goats, enjoying how they seem to move across the terrain with such ease.  Always a tad bit of envy to see how effortlessly it comes to them.    Indian Bar was deserted as I began the climb up to Cowlitz Divide.  No snow to be found on this section and because of the limited distance, I didn’t feel like I was missing out on the views of Tahoma behind me traveling as I as in a clockwise direction.  Again, the trail is in great condition with nothing major to note.    From Cowlitz I dropped down to Box Canyon, here the trail has some repaving being done but you are still allowed to walk on it.   The miles from here to Stevens Canyon were easy going and I was able to make good time.  Then begins a long climb up to Reflection Lakes.  Of note in this section, there are passages that are overgrown but not terrible.  I find the section that crosses the landslide to be pretty tame but my experience climbing Bulgers probably helped with that.  Just take your time here and be sure of your footing and you should be fine.   Fortunately, it isn’t very long, maybe 50 yards.     Reflection Lakes to Longmire went by quickly as it is mostly gentle downhill.  Nothing major of note in this section of trail.  If it is your first time, a side trip to Narada Falls is worth the 0.2 mile addition.   The bridge over the Nisqually is solid and well marked.  At Longmire I stopped for about half an hour for some cold drinks, food and foot care.    Left Longmire 12 hours after leaving Sunrise.  The first four miles of the trail is in great condition.  At Kautz Creek, the creek has done some significant braiding over the years, but I found as always, for it to be well marked with cairns.  No bridge here but the creek is easy to cross using rocks.   The northern branch of the Kautz has a great bridge over it.  At this point, I had throttled back a bit on my climbs to save some energy as the miles were starting to add up but still felt I would be able to get up to Emerald Ridge, another favorite spot, before the sunset.      The climb up to Indian Henrys is long but gradual and the alpine meadow the old cabin sits in is worth the effort.  Even without the mountain towering over this area, I paused to soak it all in.  Again, the wildflowers are around but not for much longer.  For the first time, I had this area all to myself and I cherished the solitude in this setting.      The drop down to Tahoma creek is in good shape and as always, crossing the suspension bridge is a treat.   The climb out of Tahoma has some overgrown spots down low that has the possibility of getting the early morning traveler wet so keep that in mind.  But once you rise up out of the treeline, you are treated to fantastic views of the rocky terrain in this area that has been shaped by the glaciers above.  These views rejuvenated my energy and there was enough breaks in the clouds for me to get views of the sunset alpenglow on the mountain soaring overhead. As I had hoped, I made it up to Emerald Ridge right before sunset and while the clouds concealed the mountain for the most part, the small glimpse I got were well worth the effort.    Darkness fell as I descended the rocky and technical trail to the crossing off the South Puyallup.  I pulled out the headlamp here and started the climb out.  Again, the lower section of this climb is overgrown and could be very wet in the early morning.   I gained altitude and found myself in the clouds and what I could see through my headlamp was very limited.  Even on my highest beam, I couldn’t see St Andrew Lake as I passed it nor Aurora Lake just passed it.   While missing out on this section in the dark is one of the byproducts of this kind of journey, it was a unique and interesting experience to travel through it in these dark and foggy conditions.      The descent to the North Puyallup is one of my least favorite sections of trail.  It has patches that are in rough shape and overgrown.  Footing can be tricky in daylight conditions so in the dark, even more care had to be taken.  Here my legs were really starting to rebel and I found them locking up a bit which was of concern.  At the crossing of the North Puyallup, I decided to take a break.  I did some foot maintenance as there was some rough areas due to my feet being wet for such a large section of the journey.  Rubbed out my legs, ate some food and then took a quick cat nap huddled up against an old rock wall.  This would be the only sleep I would get on the journey.    I woke up feeling refreshed and working on my legs had them feeling good.  On the long climb out, I really took a moderate pace and enjoyed the easy going nature of the trail in this section.   Like the last climb, I found myself in the clouds and hunkered down as I climbed.  But not long after I felt that the darkness surrounding me had gotten lighter, I then noticed stars above me and the flickering of city lights in the distance.  A low rumble behind me got my attention and I turned around to see the silhouette of the massive mountain below the moon.  Wisps of clouds blanketed the base of the mountain.  It was a magical moment that I took in for a few minutes before continuing on.     The trail in this section is so smooth and with refreshed legs, I found myself moving quickly over it.  Around me the sounds of wildlife were my companion and I wondered what towns were the cause of the lights far off in the distance.  So close yet they felt like a world away.  Then began the long drop down to South Mowich.  It felt like I was descending for an eternity, the dull roar of the river not getting louder as I dropped elevation.   The trail for the most part is in good condition on this section but I found some of the more technical sections far more tiring than usual.  At this point I was closing in on 70 miles and time began to stretch out, making what usually goes by rather quickly, feel like so much longer.    Eventually I hit the South Mowich and was able to find the bridge crossing it fairly easily.  It was 4:30, nearly 24 hours after starting this trip and I was beginning to feel that too.  I looked forward to my food cache at Mowich and a little daylight.  The climb up to Mowich was steep but a caffeinated gel shot woke me up and had my legs moving pretty good.  This section of trail is in great shape and the glimpses of the Tahoma in the daylight buoyed my spirts.   After a long night traveling the west side of the mountain, what greeted me at Mowich was a bit of a shock.  Even at 6:30, it was packed and there were tents placed pretty much everywhere. I felt like I had wandered into Woodstock or something.  I hobbled my way over to the ranger cabin, were my cache and some solitude was to be found.  I took some time here, eating, do some more serious foot care and working on my legs.  I had planned to go through Spray Park on my loop but watching the masses of people head down the trail changed my mind.  I opted instead to stick to the Wonderland proper and headed to Ipsut Pass.  Here I found the trail to be in good condition.  The switchbacks were steep and rocky as they will always be, but work had been done on the bushes and I wasn’t fighting any overgrowth.  At this point, I found my third or fourth wind, maybe it was the warm sun on my face.  I stripped off all my layers, stuffed them in my pack and began to make good time once again.    The trail along the Carbon River is in good shape with the exception of one small landslide that reduces the trail to a very narrow section but there is a rope placed there if you so wish to use it.  The landslide right before the Carbon River crossing has been worked on as well.  The trail is well marked across the Carbon with cairns.  Then begins the long climb up to Moraine Park.  At this point while I felt pretty good, my legs were just flat out getting fatigued and it slowed me down.  It seemed a never ending journey up on this section and while I appreciated the sun, so did the bugs!   But as always, the landscape is incredible and the Carbon Glacier never fails to impress me.  On the last section before Moraine Park, I heard a sound like rumbling thunder.  I as quickly as I could, moved up the trail to get a better view of the mountain. Sure enough, a massive rockslide on the north face of the mountain had occurred and a cloud of dust and debris rose from the mountain.     I made my way to the pass above Moraine Park in what seemed like a snail’s pace.  Thankful for some downhill finally.  At Mystic Lake, I took another break for foot and leg care hoping that it would get me through to the end (which it did).  I was 89 miles in at this point, but the end was in sight!  I do enjoy the section between Mystic and the crossing of the Winthrop though.  The giant moraine with the mountain overhead is a special landscape.  There is a new bridge over the Winthrop that is about a hundred yards downstream of where the old one was.  Very thankful that they have gotten it in as the Winthrop was raging at this point.      Then began the final climb.  Views of the Winthrop Glacier and the mountain kept me motivated on the way up and then on the final switchbacks to the pass, the views of the subranges north of the mountain helped to pass the time.  Now it was nearing two in the afternoon and thunderclouds were building up around the mountains.  Something I had never experienced on this trail before. At the pass, I could see nearly to the finish and was thankful for clear trails along this entire section.  Thunder sounded in the distance and it crossed my mind that I should pick up the pace!     At the junction with Burroughs and Fremont I had enough energy to chase a chipmunk that had an entire sandwich in its mouth but I was just too slow at this point.  Huge rain drops started to fall as I weaved my way through the usual weekend traffic found at Sunrise.  To finish the trip I opted to take the Sourdough Trail as I like the views of Tahoma from this trail instead of dropping down to Sunrise Lake where the mountain is hidden.   Lightning flashed a few times south of us near the Cowlitz Chimneys, the thunder echoing across the space seconds later.    34:25 into my journey I was back at the start.  Tired but thankful for the experience.  I had never thought I would try a push straight through like this but I always advise people to try new and different things and it was time for me to follow my advice.  In hindsight I truly enjoyed it and though I won’t make it a frequent occurrence, I believe that it will be something I embark on at least once or twice a year.     The totals: 34:25 elapsed time.  98 miles.  27,000’ of cumulative gain.  	Aug 05, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-05.9375179260
Naches Peak Loop	lpick10	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Wildflowers are in full bloom at Tipsoo Lake! I intended to do the full loop, but I got sidetracked by photographing all the flowers at the start and it was starting to heat up! There were plenty of Western Anemone, American Bistort, Arrowleaf Groundsel, Alpine Aster, Magenta Paintbrush, and Rosy Spiria surrounding the lake. The bugs weren't nearly as bad as I had been expecting by the lake (I did spray myself with Deet before starting, though). It was a great day to be out, although I was disappointed to see several people here and at Sunrise going off the path into the meadows (something I also saw at Hurricane Ridge in Olympic National Park - very frustrating!).  I'm hoping to come back in Fall to catch the colors and do the full loop. 	Aug 05, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-05.6307337946
Icicle Gorge Nature Loop	plantpoweredhiker	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Perfect hike for the family, I’ve taken my twin kiddos up there twice now and they love it!

Chain Lakes Loop	Canuck Jay	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Intermittent snow - not hard to cross	Arrived quite early at Artist Point parking lot (7:30 am) where there was only 3-4 other cars on a beautiful crisp sunny Saturday.  Having hiked this trail in September 2016 counter clockwise we decided to hike it clockwise for a change.  The trail is in great condition and snow free 90% of the way - there were times where we had to backtrack when we lost the trail temporarily because of the snow but if you go up to higher ground or vantage point you will see the trail.  Going early you avoid the crowds and the incessant biting mosquitos and deer flies. Discouraged to see broken beer bottle and trash along parts of the trail- did our best to pick up trash left behind. Due to popularity of this incredible trail it will occasionally bring out newbies that don't know any better.  Please people take out your trash and keep it beautiful for others to enjoy :-)	Aug 05, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-05.4563786716
Glacier Peak	lcmlcm	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snowfields to cross - could be difficult	We summited the most remote volcanic peak in Washington - Glacier peak, via the Disappointment Peak Cleaver route! My Gaia GPS tracked 9,846 ft elevation gain over 34.9 mi in 3 days. A great time venturing into the Glacier peak wilderness area. A well defined trail, minimal crevasse, well kicked in steps in the glacier and gentle snow slope all made it a perfect beginner level glacier climb. The best view I've had on the approach to a climb. Meadows, flowers in full bloom, alpine butterflies, and creeks were all on the menu.  Thanks to our great climbing guide Sandeep Nain from Miyar Adventures!  This is a long report mixed with photos. Here are the sections: 2,100' -> 5,700' (10 mi) Started at trailhead 9:30am Reached camp ~3:30pm 5,700' -> 7,000' (4.3 mi) Left camp 1 ~9am Arrived at camp 2 1:35pm 10,500' (3.54 mi) 10,500' -> 2,100' (17 mi) Camp -> summit: 5h10m, summit -> camp 3h10m Left camp 2:35am Summited 7:45am Back to camp 12:15pm Left camp 2pm  Back to White pass ~4/5pm Back to  Back to car 9:40pm First 5mi was a chill and flat (1,000' gain) hike in the shade. Didn't need sunscreen or hat. The trail followed along  The trail leaving the White pass camp was a flat and very long traverse along the mountain. Many streams running across the traverse (easy for water filtering). Then we went up some loose sand and topped out at 6,800', where we had the first sight of the Glacier peak. It was gorgeous!!! I thought we were almost there, given the current elevation. Nope! I wish. Then we quickly dropped 800' through some loose terrain, to a basin. We saw 2 tents there. Since we had so much today and only 1 goal to move the camp higher, we were going up further to make the summit day a easier. From the basin up to the camp, there is no more well defined trail. But navigation was still easy if you following the carins and a recent GPX track. It's a beautiful basin to be wandering around at - views of glacier, and reflection of peaks in the lake. There were patches of snow in the basin, but not worth switching to boots, since they were flat and had deep boot tracks. I tried to walk through these as fast as I can to avoid getting my shoes soaked in. As the day went by and the snow melted more, my toes got wet a few times but got dried pretty quickly afterwards. A few stream crossing - not wide, and easy to balance with poles. A few muddy places.  We were happy to run into a few people who successfully summited today (a group did 8hrs round trip from where we planned to camp at). Their beta was consistently about the glacier having steps well kicked in, doable with a rope, and moving fast in the rockfall zone especially later in the day. A c2c climber and a couple turned around because they didn't have enough time.  We reached a nice camping spot in the dirt at 7,000', surrounded by rocks and near a stream, at 1:30pm. After filtering water and made dinner, we also packed what we needed for the summit, to save time for tomorrow AM. We didn't expect to rope up and use crampons right away, so we packed them.  It was very difficult to fall asleep at 5pm, with the sun hitting the tent and with very little breeze inside the tent. Brutal. It took me more than 2 hours, I had to cover my face with a hat.  We woke up to the alarm clock at 2am, had hot breakfast, and geared up (gaiters, headlamp and ice ax), and started walking at 2:35am. Without having to put on crampons and rope up, gearing up was quick. The trek leaving the camp was a flat walk on slushy snow, easily manageable with boots. We started our journey with some gentle snow slopes and some rock scrambles. We put on crampons and helmets at 7,800' where we dropped from a ridge (in dirt) to snow, icy but had good tracks. Kept crampons all the way to the summit and back to this point.  At 8,600', there was a rock fall zone. We heard a few small rocks falling on the way and down. You can see rocks on both sides of the boot tracks. We tried to move quickly in this section. Not a big concern in the early morning when snow was firmer, but def be more cautious on the way down. Breath taking view from the back, with sun rising above the horizon and lightening up the distant peaks.  At 9,000', we found a rock island to the right to rope up and shorten the rope with kiwi coil. We could have gone up further unroped, but wanted to be cautious seeing the slope becoming steeper and not knowing if there was a good platform to rope up later. The boot track that we were going for was shown in the above picture. Trip reports from around this time of the year mentioned that people roped up somewhere between 8,500' and 9,000', and unroped and scrambled the last 500-1000'. There were barely any crevasses. But some really deep cracks, only a palm size wide but too deep to see the bottom. Boot tracks were well kicked in and obvious to follow.  Such a cool view behind the ridge. My favorable and most memorable view of the trip.  After the ridge, we were back to snow, the steepest part of the trip (not pictured) for the last ~300'. Again, boot tracks were deep enough to just step in, although the snow was a bit icy to plant ice ax deeply into. I tried to use the ice ax holes created by the previous climbers as much as possible. Take your time in this section. Make sure to plant the ice ax in. Only move your foot if your ice holds, and only move your ice ax if your footing is good. Move either your foot or ice axe, one at a time - not both.   Summited at 7:45am, after 5hr10m from the camp. We enjoyed the 360 degree view and some refreshing Rainier beer for almost an hour. There was summit register you can sign.  Some deep blue cracks from a far distance.  We didn't run into any human until we descended back to ~9,500'. Wish them luck!  Last stretch back to the camp. A flat walk in the snow, where we did in the dark this morning. It's interesting to see this watermelon/pink snow, a typical   caused by algae during the summer in alpine at high altitude (above 10,000 ft). Learn more the pink snow and its related research project:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watermelon_snow http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2018/may/28/wwu-researcher-continues-watermelon-snow-project/ At camp, we boiled water for a celebratory lunch and took down the tent.  Snow def has melted more in the basin. Some thin layers of snow that we crossed just the day before were already gone. We traversed a little bit. If we were to follow the carins directly, we would have to cross some quick running stream. Also much more muddy.  Other than the mud and slushier snow, the route was straightforward and known - boulder hopping.  Happy be back to the trail! Trail was wetter and muddier than the day before. I had the 'great' idea of going all the way back to car after summiting, or at least to the low camp in order to make the last day easier. I was in the mindset of ... if we can do it, why not. I'd rather suffer through day 3, then spending another night out. But I quickly realized that how grueling the trek back to the car was, as soon as we left White pass. I wasn't strong enough to live up to my ambition lol. Apparently what doesn't kill you makes your legs stronger :) Thanks to my climbing partners and my 3-day old McDonald egg muffin for powering me through the last miles. When we got to the shelter at 7:40pm, it was packed with climbers/backpackers. We quickly filtered water and started cruising the last 5mi of flat trail to the car. My climbing partners were literally running, so I had to keep up. It wasn't bad at all. We couldn't wait to get out of here.  We got back to car at 9:40pm.  (Group of 3) 4 person bug netting tent and tarp (Black Diamond Mega Bug Tent and Mega Light Tent) MSR Windburner 8 oz fuel canister (used about half for 2 dinners and 1 lunch) BeFree water filter  30m*8mm glacier rope 2 pickets w/ double runner and biner  Garmin InReach   ***Highly recommend approach shoes or running shoes for the approach, which would make your feet much happier :)  Bug spray Checked at 5:30am on day 1, before we left Seattle.

Copper Ridge Loop	mattabouttown	Obstacles on trail:	    Trees down across trail,	    Overgrown in places.	Road suitable for all vehicles	TL/DR version: Some of the best hiking I've done in 10 years living in WA. Stellar views abound. So do the bugs.  Started out from the Hannegan TH around 1:00pm on Saturday, Aug 4, after a short night's sleep in the car at the permit office in Marblemount (open an hour earlier than the service center in Glacier). WTA volunteers (hurray!) and swarms of black flies (boo!) were out in force along the first 4.5-mile stretch heading up to Hannegan Pass. Snowy views of Ruth Mountain and promises of breezes on the other side of the pass kept up spirits. We opted to forgo the hike up Hannegan Peak, but probably should have gone for it as Saturday was the least hazy/smoky day we had. Stopped for water at a small unmarked stream below the switchbacks NE of the pass, before Boundary Camp.  We opted to do the loop counter-clockwise, and this proved to be the consensus pick among our group of four, all of whom are recent dads and didn't have the legs to make a push up the ridge on Day 1 or Day 2 (more on the benefits of this direction below). We made camp at Copper Creek just as the thunderclouds started to roll in and enjoyed the gentle rain on our tents as we bedded down for the night.  Day 2 was from Copper Creek to Indian Creek, and proved to be an unexpectedly fun and adventurous day on what we had otherwise billed as a rest/river walk day. The cable car across the Chilliwack is definitely the way to go versus the river ford. Just a short 1.2 miles from the cable car is a great spot to fill up on water and soak your feet/take a nap at Brush Creek. Highly recommend making the stop there, as the 3.4 miles from Brush Creek to Indian Creek are long ones through extended stretches of thick brush requiring plenty of noisy presence-making. We spotted a black bear sow in the brush who was still there 10 minutes later after we had slowly backed up the trail to give her space. She and her cub (now both uphill about 50 feet from our location on the trail) slowly sauntered off after the second sighting, and we calmly continued on our way, bear spray in hand until Indian Creek. There was a downed tree just past our bear sighting that required packs off and under which we moved as efficiently as possible.  The suspension bridge over Indian Creek capped the day's adventures. We tucked in to an unclaimed campsite at the far end of camp (sorry NPS, but we were not overly enthusiastic about your description of the overgrown trail to the no-man's-land Bear Creek Camp at dusk) and waited three hours until around 8:00pm before we decided it was unlikely another party was coming to claim their permitted site, and finally pitched our tents. There was a fair amount of twigs and branches snapping in the woods (in otherwise calm weather) throughout the night, which further solidified our decision to not have pushed on to Bear Creek.  Day 3 started with an easy walk down to the Indian Creek/Chilliwack River fords. As you approach the water, look for pink flags on both sides of the first crossing to guide you. When we crossed around 8:00am, water was calf-high and relatively easy to navigate. Once across the first crossing (heading west), we continued to follow the pink flags across a large gravel bar that led to the second crossing. Here, we had beta from a couple who had crossed in the opposite direction that there is very large downed tree with a medium-sized blue swimming hole to your right (heading toward the ridge), and that was the best place to cross, as it is not flagged. We found the log and the swimming hole, crossed, and went for a quick swim before getting our boots back on for the long haul up the switchbacks.  The good news about heading up the ridge is more than 2/3 of your elevation is gained under relatively good tree cover. We didn't end up putting on sunscreen until around 4,400 when the switchbacks break out above the treeline and you're starting to go up through hot brush, all the while thinking your're going to duck back into some trees, but never really do. All the more reason to break your camp as early as you can that morning and avoid having to hike the last 3.5 miles to Copper Lake in the worst heat of the day. Other than the heat above the treeline, the only other minor annoyance (no bugs!) on the push upward were a few easily hopped logs down across the trail. None required packs off.  From above the treeline heading toward Copper Lake, we spotted a small fire flaring up on the SW side of Nodoubt Peak across the valley. We talked to the NPS ranger the next day at the fire lookout and she said they'd sent a helicopter to check it out.  The one section before topping out on the ridge we had heard might still have some snow was crossing a large boulder field about 1.25 miles before Copper Lake. The trail clearly ducks just below the remaining snow, and while slightly exposed, the boulder field crossing posed no problems. Alas, I'd carried a pair of microspikes all that way for nothing.  Swimming in Copper Lake was a godsend after a hot day gaining the ridge. The mosquitoes kept us dancing around camp or hunkered down in our tents the rest of the evening, even after dusk. That said, all agreed (including a previously incredulous Coloradan) that this must be one of the Top 10 campsites in all of the Great American West. The haze throughout the valley was thick in the afternoon, but clearer in the morning enough to enjoy some pretty crisp views of Whatcom, Challenger, etc. And the moon rising across the valley with a galaxy full of stars was equally surreal/spectacular at night; set an alarm if it's clear.  The push up to the fire lookout from the lake on Day 4 did not mess around -- steep and stunning switchbacks make their way above the lake as though it were on fire, and soon enough our legs were. The view from the lookout, much like the camp we left below, must be one of the singularly greatest west of the Mississippi (begging the question how many great views are actually east of the Mississippi), and surely in all of North Cascades NP. It's the kind of view that makes you want to return to the trailhead and civilization if only to rattle off a resignation letter for whatever job is keeping you from wandering that and other equally impressive ridge lines for years to come.  Coming down off the ridge (begrudgingly), you're still treated to stellar views and the teasingly distant line of the trail hundreds of feet below as you make your way toward Egg Lake. We opted to carry extra reserve bags of H2O to treat along the way rather than drop the extra 300 vert. ft. to Egg Lake for a fill-up. If you're smart, you can make it from Copper Lake to Boundary Camp (or a stream running down the scree field just below the switchbacks back up to Hannegan Pass that looks to be good for at least another couple weeks) without the detour to Egg Lake. Two small streams marked on the Green Trails map below 5,400 on the Copper Ridge Trail heading back toward Boundary Camp are bone dry this time of year.  The final push back up over Hannegan Pass was a breeze compared to the climb up from the Chilliwack to Copper Lake, and we cruised the last 4.5 miles from the Pass to the TH in record time knowing that a good long soak in Ruth Creek, followed by pizza and beer in Glacier, awaited us. Prying ourselves off those bar stools was nearly as hard as prying us away from some of the best views of the Cascades one could hope to have. 	Aug 04, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-09.3495431513
Tatoosh Lookout	Climber Keith	Minor obstacles posing few problems	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	I picked this hike that is just about equidistant from the Seattle and Portland areas since I was meeting a friend from down south.  We are both in good shape, so chose to go all the way to the old lookout site.  If you have the legs for it, the summit view on a clear day is well worth the effort.   The directions to the TH worked for us although FR 5270 is not signed all that well, so start watching for that turn when you get close to four miles in.  We almost drove past it since it only has a small sign after the turn.  For the rest of the drive just stay on the main road and watch for the TH sign.  Only a pothole one in a while. We started early to beat the heat (at the TH around 8am and the third car at the limited parking area) and even though it was a fairly cool August day, we were happy to get through the lower 2000' of forested switchbacks before it started to warm up too much.  From around 2000' to 2500' we started to see some ripe huckleberries along the trail which was an unexpected bonus.  Above that you start to get into the payoff for the trip which are the meadows high on the mountain just below the ridge line where you start to get peek-a-boo views of Mt. Rainier.  It looks like there are opportunities to scramble up to view points well in advance of the lookout site if you want to limit your mileage and skip the final large cirque traverse that leads to the summit spur, but we didn't stray from the mail trail. Crossing the rock slide area at around 3.5 miles in was relatively easy (there was no snow left at all) although care is required since there is some quite steep run-out below the crossings in a couple areas.  Finding the hairpin spur to the summit at 4.5 miles proved to be problematic though as it is not signed where it can be seen from the main trail.  The best advice here is that if you get to the notch where the trail continues on the east side of the ridge down toward the South TH, you have gone too far.  We ended up backtracking to find it and placed a branch across the trail to aid future visitors in finding the slightly overgrown spur (even though the views to the east beyond the notch are nice as well and worth taking the time to check out).  From there just keep going up the ridge until to get to the top where hopefully you are greeted with a stellar view of the south side of Mt. Rainier and the surrounding neighbor peaks. We were just a bit too late for a perfectly clear view (a few cumulus clouds starting to pop up), and smoke from fires eliminated the most distant views of Mt. Adams and Mt. St. Helens.  But even considering that, it was still amazing.  There were a few bugs at the top, but they were not too bad for the most part and we stayed for around an hour to enjoy an extended break with lunch and fantastic views.  We saw one other explorer checking out the frozen lake area down below north of the summit during our visit, but surprisingly we had the top to ourselves other than that.  I did some minor exploring for a better viewpoint to photograph from, but didn't make the decent all the way to the lake.  By early afternoon on the decent the bugs (flies mostly) started to be more of an annoyance especially when stopping in the last mile back to the TH, but were tolerable.

Skyline Divide	Gatlin Beemus	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free		Aug 04, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-07.4624259128
Lake Ballinger Park	misswhitney	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Parking on the North side near the senior center (just South of the playground) allowed for a quiet and leisurely stroll, even on a sunny Saturday afternoon. The tall grass is...tall, which gave the wide and otherwise very plain path an "amber waves of grain" feeling. The big cotton wood trees are probably beautiful in the fall.  After about .3 miles of walking (totally estimating) the brush that blocks your view of the lake clears out, and the trail (now lousy with mole holes - watch your ankles) dumps you out to a lovely picnic area, beach access, boat launch, and a little pier. A perfect spot to pack a lunch and an inflatable floatie to lounge on the water. There are bathrooms, but they were locked at the time of our visit. (Alternately, you can drive and park here if you want to skip the walk.)  After about 30 minutes of playing in the lake, we went back the way we came.  This hike/walk would be great for kids and folks utilizing a sturdy wheelchair. The mole holes might be a little hazardous for hikers with balance challenges. 	Aug 04, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-07.4561763018
Artist Ridge - Huntoon Point	susanjmunn	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Intermittent snow - not hard to cross	Parked at the Artist Point parking lot. It's a very crowded place on a Saturday. The trail is mostly snow free. There's a lot of snow to play on around the parking lot and trail though. Some guys set up a rail to snowboard on. There were also a lot of dogs loving the snow.  This short hike is pretty straightforward. Although from its popularity there are several braided social trails that have been made from people wandering around, so it can be a bit confusing. We hiked around the ridge and up to Huntoon Point. We laughed because it was such an easy hike and it looked like there was a summit register at the top. We opened it to register ourselves after that really intense hike up 200ft (this is sarcasm for those that are reading this too literally lol). It turned out to be a geocache full of business cards. Awesome views of Mt. Baker and Shuksan. I don't remember any bugs in this area. Very beautiful landscape, happy it's accessible to the masses.

Oyster Dome	Cometita	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	We hiked from the Samish Overlook to Oyster Dome late in the day --started around 5pm. Beautiful hike without too many folks on the trail and gorgeous late day views from Oyster Dome. 	Aug 04, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-06.0035690236
Tubal Cain Mine	Peter Ellis	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Day one of two WTA work parties on Tubal Cain had three separate groups going out to various spots past the 1.5 mile mark to address various tread and brushing issues. I ended up with the brushing crew, going 1.66 miles up the trail to continue work from   (at about this same time!) Lots of rhododendrons were cleared ("sacrificed"?) in the name of ensuring a pleasant experience for trail users, particularly stock. We had a hardy group which included youth volunteers (yay for getting those work party hours in!) and first timers, with significant overlap between the two! Users should now notice that the trail corridor opens up substantially after the first water crossing around the 1.5 mile mark. Day two had a brushing crew pushing closer to that water crossing (but that's a separate trip report!)	Aug 04, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-06.0463427227
Snow Lake	clinej	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	The trail is in great condition given the extremely high foot traffic, thanks in large part to WTA work parties like the one this weekend. A big thanks to everyone involved! Weekends are incredibly dense in terms of cars in the lot and folks on the trail so if possible I highly recommend visiting mid week or during inclement weather when you can enjoy a bit of solitude. The lake is huge and the trail continues along it's North side for about a half mile so don't turn back too early and miss the awesome views further along. Campfires aren't allowed at this or any of the neighboring lakes in the Alpine Lakes Wilderness (including Upper Wildcat) so overnighters should bring backpacking stoves to cook any food. ***A nice looking camera and neck strap were found near the West end of the lake beside the trail and taken to the North Bend ranger station on Saturday. Call the info desk with a description if you think it's yours.***	Aug 04, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-06.0317754016
Spectacle Lake	Tailwinds	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were terrible	Snow free	A long, beautiful, easy approach over fantastic trails leads to steep climb through a burnt out forest that is stunning with wildflowers, before finally descending in to a supremely picturesque alpine valley. There are two pit toilets, one at Pete Lake and another at Spectacle Lake, which was dug new this past weekend.  Mosquitoes were nasty, especially in the morning. The lake is about as cold as might be enjoyably swam in on a hot day, its bottom is thick with sandal-swallowing silt. The stream crossing at mile 5.5 is legit. Deepest point just hit the bottoms of our shorts and was exceptionally cold and a bit quick moving. The stream is fed not by the warmer lake, but directly from melting snow. All other crossings we were able to keep feet dry.  On the weekend there were over a dozen tents around Spectacle, but there's plenty of room up there for all. If a bit more serenity is desired, there's another camp site just past the bridge that crosses the magnificent waterfall. It's within an hour of the Spectacle campground, maybe less.

Snow Lake	Ky Carter	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	I had so much fun on this hike! It was so beautiful. The only thing was that there were SO MANY PEOPLE. Which is a good thing that people are out enjoying the trails, but it was very very crowded. My dog Mozzy enjoyed it as well and got to meet many four legged friends. There were some people who weren't being neighborly and had their dogs off leash even though it was against the rule, but at least they were all well behaved and there were no incidents. Can't wait to bring my husband and parent-in-laws!	Aug 04, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-06.9238994321
Yellow Aster Butte	Beangod3	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were not too bad	Intermittent snow - not hard to cross	Hike up Yellow Aster Butte on Saturday.  Overall a lovely hike. There are a few tiny tiny spots with snow but nothing to worry about. But over all snow free. The bugs let up once you hit the meadow as does the steepness. WTA BCRT crew was out there for the weekend doing some lovely work on a rockwall and tiny switch back. Summited in just under 3 hours and had the summit to myself. Lots of campers out there including the trail crew. I will have to get back and backpack up here.  Please note this is now a blue bag area.. you must pack out all bathroom stuff that it not pee, including all toilet paper and your number 2s. No cat-holes.	Aug 04, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-06.2865297843
North Twentymile Peak	Jacob Wolniewicz	Obstacles on trail:	    Trees down across trail,	    Overgrown in places.	Road suitable for all vehicles	Did this is in a day. The two look outs are worth the treck, and the smaller one even was unlocked so we could peek inside. Recommend wearing pants. The trail has lots of brush growing into it and our legs got pretty scratched walking through. Also recommend a GPS, the top of the switch backs has lots of fallen trees and it is easy to get lost. Having a GPS to at least know you're walkin in the right direction is very useful. The ridge lines and areas not affected by fire were very beautiful. A hike worth doing! It took us 6 hours 15 minutes car to car. 3.5 hours to the top, 30 minute lunch break then 2 hours 15 minutes back to the car. We were a party of two and moving fast, I'd expect around 8 hours with a larger party.	Aug 04, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-06.4713651303
Laughingwater Creek to Three Lakes	lumsdenml	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	This was a beautiful hike, could be quite the grind. The first mile or so climbs at a pretty steady rate.  Trail was in great condition with no issues, but the uphill is constant.  The trail drops down for about a quarter of a mile after you reach the top of a ridge, but then returns to climbing until you reach the 6 mile mark just before three lakes.  The lakes (large ponds, really) are very pretty.  Calm waters, a pretty forest service cabin nearby as well as ducks.  I continue past the lakes to the junction with the Pacific Crest Trail and it was again, all up hill to the junction.  But, the extra 1.5 miles to the junction were well worth it.  The open views of Mount Rainier are just gorgeous.  If you still have the legs and the time, it is effort well spent.  The trip back is pretty quick and easy, as it is all downhill.  Only met a few people on the trail (a family, 3 trail runners, a couple hiking, a solo hiker and someone on horseback) but was mostly alone for the 14.5 mile trip.

Gothic Basin	trailmama	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Having been up to Gothic twice as a day trip, decided to try an overnight.  A lot of other hikers had the same great idea -- the trail seemed more like Mt. Si than a Mountain Loop hike.  Lots of day hikers and backpackers.  I was wondering if we would even be able to find a camping spot at Foggy Lake, but everyone seemed to find a spot eventually.  Foggy Lake is still partially frozen and very beautiful with Gothic Peak and Del Campo flanking it on either side.  A great photo op. Our original plan was to climb Del Campo, but there is still a snow field on the gully leading to the summit.  I wasn't expecting this, and hadn't brought an ice axe.  And my personal rule is no steep snow slopes without an axe.  There were other climbers doing just fine without one though.  Instead we scrambled up to Gothic Peak.  There are still some snow fields on the way up to the ridge that leads to the summit, but very easy to cross. As we were hiking out on Sunday, there was a steady stream of hikers coming up to take in the granite beauty of Gothic Basin.

The Enchantments	zdwheels	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were terrible	Intermittent snow - not hard to cross	Beautiful hike, highly recommend! Here is our schedule and some notes on each section: 6:00am Dropped car off at Snow Lake TH, used Loop Connector for ride to Stuart Lake TH 6:30am Start hike @ Stuart Lake TH. First section is mostly in woods with a mild ascent. Make sure you turn left at ~2.5 miles towards Colchuck! Hit Colchuck lake - totally gorgeous. Got to Asgaards pass and prepared to begin ascent around 8:45. 8:45am Started ascent. This was pretty tough. ~2800 ft climb in a little under a mile. Not a clear path but Cairns were easy to spot. Got the top around 11:30am. 11:30am - Reached summit, 5 hours on the dot! Walked down the lake right near the summit (less than 10 min away) to get more water and eat lunch. Also put on some layers, its quite cold up there. 12:00pm - Finished food/water, began hiking through Core Zone. It is breath-taking. Plenty of lakes for water, a handful of toilets near the trail. You are going off of cairns that can be hard to spot at times - I had the all trails app with the map on it and GPS worked in airplane mode. I highly recommend doing this. It was helpful multiple times when we couldn't find a cairn right away. It was also busy enough that you invariably ran into groups on most parts of the trail, though, so hard to get totally lost. After you get through the main cluster of lakes, you have 1-2 miles of walking until you hit Snow Lake. This section had a lot of technical downhills - climbing down rocks etc. We finally got to Snow Lake and continued the trail along the east side towards the northern tip. We arrived at the northern edge at 4pm. That includes roughly 30 minutes of small stops, bathroom breaks etc. Bugs were bad here and continued to get worse. We had good bug spray though (30% deet) so they weren't really an annoyance for us. 4:00 Stopped at northern edge of snow lake to get water. Snow lake is one of the last main areas to get water so recommend you fill up here. My GPS may have been wrong but said it was about 12.5 miles in. We switched our layers and ate more here. 4:20 Started the last leg to Snow Lake TH! I know people call this last part the death march or the war of attrition, but I thought it was really pretty! It was about an hour in the woods, and then 2 hours on the side of a mountain in a partial forrest, very moderate downhill.  7:10 We can see the parking lot!! But it still seemed far away... started the infamous switch backs 7:40 Arrived at Snow Lake TH. 13 hours 10 min total with about 75-90 minutes of assorted breaks and stops Overall, tips: Have fun! 	Aug 04, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-05.0677477937
Columbia Plateau Trail - Fish Lake	cassb08	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	My husband and our two dogs frequent this paved trail since it is so close to our home. It is a great path next to Fish Lake that is accessible for walkers, bikers and has wheel chair accessibility. Over all the path is well maintained. Water flows next the trail and beautiful foliage and scattered wildflowers can be seen. Bees were noted along the way. A Discovery Pass is required for parking.

Deering Wildflower Acres	Tickslady	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	The kids (6, 3, 1.5yo) and I spent the morning exploring this hidden gem in Marysville. The mosquitos were out in full force, but that was the only unpleasant thing about it. The forest was filled with Western Red Cedar, Red Alder, Hemlock, and Douglas Fir, providing respite from the sun on a hot day. The trail was lined with plump red huckleberries and a few late salmonberries. A little woodpecker loudly pecked away, and a pair of Stellar's Jays loudly argued in the forest. The trail was well maintained and easy to navigate, with maps at every intersection courtesy of the Boy Scouts. The pond was surrounded with blooming wildflowers, but unfortunately there is no beach to sit and enjoy the still-watered view. Deering has a long history in this area, used as a survey site for biologists from Western Washington University, and then donated to the city of Marysville and opened to the public in the 90's. This area is still used for research and while it is opened to the public, food and dogs are forbidden in order to help protect the delicate ecosystem.

Faraway Rock	pnwhiker	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	I was already parked at Reflection Lake and had just finished up my first hike. I finished my morning with this short side hike. The view once finally reaching the top is well worth the effort. Do note: there are some rather tall steps which would be a challenge for kids or short people; poles are helpful! Trail was busy with people traveling down from Paradise on the Lake Trail (many got to Reflection Lake to wait for a ride back to Paradise). Even though it may be slightly cooler in the park, please remember to bring an adequate supply of water (or have a filter handy) and snacks!

Observation Peak	Sunrise Creek	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	No bugs	Snow free	We celebrated Washington Trails Day with a hike to Observation Peak via the backdoor approach from Sister Rocks Research Natural Area. Despite the drive to the trailhead on rough and poorly marked roads, three vehicles already were at the trailhead when we arrived. We met about a half dozen other hiking parties during our hike, including a trio of backpackers looking for Berry Camp. This hike, including the side trip to the former fire lookout site on Sister Rocks, is 7 miles and 1,575 feet elevation gain. Walking under the cool shade of towering oldgrowth silver fir and western hemlocks felt quite pleasant. The forest undergrowth was moist from fog-drip of marine air last night and seemed fresh compared to drier forests. The sun was warm on the summit of Observation Peak but a light breeze counteracted the heat. We enjoyed Vaux's swifts swooping over our heads and all around the summit while we ate lunch. The big Cascades volcanoes were obscured by clouds that built up into thunderheads as the day progressed. We found a few wildflowers blooming along the trail and at the summits of Sister Rocks and Observation Peak. The most notable was the first blooms of Explorer's Gentian just below the Observation Peak summit. Following a fine day on the trail, we stopped in Washougal on the drive home for beers and dinner at 	Aug 04, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-04.5777764384
Skyline Trail Loop	ksol595	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Arrived at the Paradise lot around 8:15am on Saturday morning.  The lot was around half full.  There was a four car wait at the Longmire park entry, so breezed right in.  We started by heading down the Paradise Valley to Faraway Rock, then headed north along Mazama Ridge and up to Panorama Point.  We saw few hikers for the first half of our hike.  Coming down from Panorama Point to Paradise there were quite a few people on the trail.  Everyone was in good spirits and enjoying the beautiful views in all directions.  The weather was perfect (not too hot, not too cold).  Many wildflowers were blooming.  We saw lots of marmots and chipmunks and a few deer.  It was a great hike and made for a wonderful 8-mile loop.  We saw WTA volunteers on the Skyline trail (thanks!).  Paradise was packed when we left around 1:30.  Leaving the park, the line of cars heading in was crazy long.  I would guess at hour or two wait just to get in the park.  The early bird gets the worm!

Heather - Maple Pass Loop	Ian R	Minor obstacles posing few problems	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	WTA said this trail was closed due to the fires, but we checked with an info center in Winthrop and most trails have been opened since 8/3.    My family and I started the Maple Pass Loop around 2:45pm. We decided to take the clockwise route per the suggestions on WTA. The atmosphere was pretty smokey from the fires burning nearby, so while the views were absolutely stunning, they were still quite limited. We heard and even saw a few dusky grouse as we neared the high point. The trail was pretty rocky throughout, so wear boots with plenty of support.    The weather was perfect until we got to the top. We were surprised to find ourselves caught in heavy rain and hail, moderate winds, and even saw lightning nearby. It was a little unnerving, especially hearing the thunder echo from the mountains, but the storm passed and we were able to make it back down without slipping or anything. It continued to drizzle and quietly thunder all the way back.    We made it back to the parking lot at 6:30pm. There were relatively few other hikers on the trail (probably because most people aren't crazy enough to start a seven-mile hike in the mid-afternoon, which wasn't my idea, btw). The parking lot was almost empty as we were leaving, though it was quite full when we arrived.	Aug 04, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-04.9574772894

Evans Creek Preserve	RedmondWriter	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	 2018: arrived at the parking lot at 10:30 and there were a couple spaces remaining in the parking lot. Upon our return to the lot at 12:00, cars were parked along the road. While my daughter-in-law's husband and my husband had their annual Man Date at the Top Fuel races, us girls and my 13-month-old grandson took a leisurely hike/walk through the Preserve for our Woman Date. Several families on the trails which are always a delight to see. Even though there are prominent signs saying that the preserve is not an off-leash park, the greater percentage of dogs were not on a leash and there were piles and piles of dog poop on the trails that weren't picked up even though the preserve provides bags. Ugh. I went to Evans Creek Preserve two years ago but didn't explore it sufficiently. I was happy my daughter-in-law knew her way around the preserve; I had no idea there were so many trails! When her husband worked for the City of Sammamish, he helped build one of the bridges, so of course, the one photo I share is of that bridge.

Goat Peak	Zipster	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	This trip report is for FS trail #959 which leads to the American Ridge Trail and Goat Peak.  Trail conditions along American Ridge are much improved since our July 7th hike. The Forest Service has done significant clearing of downed trees and debris blocking the trail.  For this Saturday hike, the parking area was full by 9am.  Views at the top were hazy due to the Miriam fire near White Pass.  Thunderheads were mounting and we were sure to get off the peak.  We were about a mile down the trail when the thunder started but there was no rain . The next day we learned there had been hail and heavy rain at Chinook Pass. By the way, the WTA online map for this particular hike is not accurate. Please look at the FS link and the Google link included in this trip report. The TH is across the street from Cougar Flats campground. Also see my earlier July 7, 2018 trip report.

Kettle Crest South 	wheresmytoque	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	First time in the charming Colville National Forest. Hiked the South Kettle Crest Trail north from the White Mtn trailhead. No other cars, and saw no other hikers on the 10 miles to the Snow Peak cabin. Lots of up & down and fantastic views of the surrounding hills. Tons of lupin beyond their bloom, so I can imagine it was magnificent a few weeks ago. Still lovely areas of Indian paintbrush. Chirpy critters abound and the area is buzzing with busy bees. Minimal mosquitos. Minimal smoke. Trail is in great condition with only a couple of downed trees. Camped at great site near Snow Peak cabin for two nights, day-hiking north on day 2. Sherman Peak loop is busy with hikers and horse outfits coming up from Hwy 20. Picked a pound of hucks on the way back to the car! Would happily return to hike the northern part of the trail and explore more of the Colville National Forest.

Burroughs Mountain	gck	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Snow lingers on the trail to Burroughs longer than it does on other trails in the Sunrise area, but there's none right now. It's a good time to hike this route. Normally, I (and probably most people) enter through the Sourdough Ridge trail, but I was feeling lazy about going up first thing in the morning, so I chose to enter via Shadow Lake. It was much quieter this way, with long stretches of solitude. Fewer bugs than usual at Shadow Lake, mainly a lot of buzzing bees. Flowers on this stretch were plentiful but seemed to be mostly aster.  Mount Rainier looks fantastic from the Burroughs. Many people hike up this way, but there was enough room at each location that it never felt terribly crowded.  We didn't linger too long because the "slight chance of thunderstorms" in the forecast suddenly appeared before us. The morning had started out with blue skies with barely any clouds, but the storm moved in quickly in the afternoon, thundering and dumping hail all over the place. It's important to be prepared for going out for these hikes! 	Aug 04, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-06.1642807255

Evergreen Mountain Lookout	griffi	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	This lookout did not disappoint! Such a beautiful view at the top! The wild flowers were in full bloom on the road up and there were quite a few scattered along the trail. The bugs are pretty aggressive here; you can kind of avoid them by running around, but they are on you in a second if you aren't moving. The trail is short, but steep, so bring plenty of water and snacks. The road up is very narrow (one car wide in some points), so be prepared to slow down quickly for cars coming in the opposite direction. And watch out for rogue pot-holes! 	Aug 04, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-06.1444205664
Wellington Ghost Town	ToddlerTrekking	Minor obstacles posing few problems	Road rough but passable	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	BUTTERFLY HEAVEN! We hiked first to the old Cascade tunnel to the left and then headed to right to the snowshed and the sight of the Wellington disaster. The Snowshed was a nice cool, shady respite to the heat and is just the right amount of spooky. Coming out the far end of the snowshed, the trail narrows significantly with overgrown plants. In places you will be walking on bushwhacked flowers. The wildflowers here right now are INCREDIBLE and they were absolutely covered in butterflies. We had butterflies landing on us and flitting around from flower to flower. Many of them were mating which was an interesting um show. Go NOW for the flowers and butterflies, it really was a great experience. About 1.5 miles from the trailhead, there is a neat waterfall coming down off an old snowshed wall. It is refreshing to stand next to it. Beyond the waterfall, the tail is so overgrown and you lose the butterflies and views. I recommend tuning around at the waterfall unless you are pushing through to Windy Pass and the rest of the Iron Goat beyond. We did not have our little ones with us today, but it is a great trail for kids in this section. This summer, my four-year-old son and I are hiking to raise money for Washington Trails Association.

Goat Lake	Paisleygo	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	My husband and I brought our dog up to Goat Lake for a low key overnight trip. We parked at the trailhead at around 10am on Sat. We were delighted to see that it was not too crowded, since we expected it to be packed on a beautiful sunny August weekend. We figured it might be due to reading about the bear sightings and seeing the ominous sign at the trailhead saying "camping strongly discouraged due to aggressive bear activity", but we forged ahead bear bag hanging rope in hand and confidence that the bears are more afraid of us than we are of them. After reading the trail description I was prepared for the "grueling switchbacks" at the top, but they were shorter than I expected and there was a nice break in the middle where we strayed over to see the falls and soak our tired feet. After stopping at the falls, we saw several folks confused about how and where to go back on the trail. Looks like many people have just scrambled their way back up next to the creek - instead of getting back to the root ball and back on the established trail. Some signage at the root ball junction might be in order, as the scrambled trail is in danger of eroding the hillside away (not to mention it's pretty steep and dangerous!). I noticed the kleenex lady (or guy) had freely tossed her tissues on the path as she walked... making me wonder in what world is there a hiker that doesn't know how incredibly selfish that is... apparently my world (sorry just had to say that). We arrived at the lake around 3 and staked our claim on a sweet private(ish) spot in the campground. We dropped our packs off and headed to the lake for a refreshing dip in the lake. As we rounded the trail for our first view of the lake surrounded by snow field covered mountains we were duly rewarded for our efforts!!! Beautiful, peaceful and not that difficult to attain. We enjoyed meeting other hikers with dogs and spent the next morning scrambling over boulders to explore the right side of the lake. We found a sweet little rocky ledge for diving in and sunbathing, the perfect place for lunch. We wished we'd brought a floating device after seeing all the people with rafts and kayaks rowing up to the end of the lake - which seems to be inaccessible by land. The hike back took a looooooooooong time and I was beyond tired when we reached the car but it was a delightful weekend and my hubby and I and our dog enjoyed ourselves to the max!!! ... Can't wait to go again. Next time I'm bringing a boat ;)	Aug 04, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-06.6431896911
Skyline Divide	Christina Hickman	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Happy Washington Trails Day! Celebrated with a hike in Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest on a really lovely Satruday. We were camped at Doug Fir off highway 542 so the ride there wasn't bad. Well, the amount of time that is. The forest road is still not my favorite. It's about 13 miles of pothole-y road. Do-able for any car (even a Prius) really of you go slow and don't mind occasionally (read: 3 times) bottoming out. The way down feels much better. The parking lot was fairly full at 8:30a. The hike starts off switchbacking steeply through the forest. It's a slog but it's over fairly quickly. Once you start some switchbacks in the meadow area you aren't too far and once you see the wilderness sign, you are in for a treat. round the corner and you get your first full glimpse of Baker and boy, is it large. You could stop your hike here and be satisfied (many do it seems) but we continued on as far down the divide at the true trail goes. So, while you are walking the divide, you go up and down--a lot! I counted, I think, 5 ridges to gain and then descend and do the same on the way back. It makes the hike harder and longer than it appears on paper, especially because this is happening above 6,000'. Bring sunscreen and a hat. And water, as there aren't any water sources. At about the 4th hill, I think, bear up to the right into what is a super rocky part of the trail to climb. It the descends and comes a pass with views to both sides before continuing up a ridge to a big climb, up to one of the final ridges to climb and it's quite a slog up. My husband called it here, and I dropped my pack and ran on to the final view point. The trail continues but it more of a man-made path. This seems to be the end of the official trail. Great day of hiking. Beautiful payoff. Start early to beat crowds and then pay a visit to Artist Point like we did :)	Aug 04, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-06.2498802109
Pete Lake	racheldavidson	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	NO BUGS! It was a miracle. Pete Lake had virtually zero mosquitos, or at least nothing of a nuisance. The hike in was buggy to a manageable degree, but for this trip report I felt it most important to say that the lake was pleasantly bug-free, with a gentle breeze, and always-awesome views. I brought my parents on their first backpacking trip to Pete Lake and we enjoyed its moderate, well-maintained trail. The lake was quite crowded with day hikers and overnighters scattered along the shore, but we were easily able to find a good campsite. Water is a reasonable temp and perfect for swimming.  Would love to come back and camp at Spectacle Lake to tackle Chimney Rock, which we had stellar views of the whole time.

Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) Section J - Snoqualmie Pass to Stevens Pass	c.bellevie	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	Headed out from Snoqualmie Pass hoping to make it to Spectacle Lake. Unfortunately for me, a bad foot plant on a rock resulted in a swollen foot and only making it to the pass overlooking Park Lakes, but beautiful the entire way!  Didn't notice the bugs too much unless I stopped, except when stopping for water and then they were very aggressive.  Butterflies were out in full force, had never seen as many butterflies in one place as I did on this trip.  Lots of hikers making the trip to and from Stevens Pass and I admit I was pretty jealous. 	Aug 04, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-06.5917053152
Oregon Butte	the beard	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Perfect weather, only complaint was the directions, wish it said that the road would dead end at the trail head. But other than that beautiful! Definitely going to be a repeat.	Aug 04, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-06.2949108889
Tolmie Peak Lookout - Eunice Lake	vikr	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	Did this hike on Saturday with team. The road to trailhead is long and dusty unpaved road for like last 15 miles but all vehicle can easily do it. Parking was hard to find when we reached around 10:30 am very busy trail. It was clear when we started as we could see Ranier from Mowich Lake but by the time we reached lookout the clouds rolled in and just covered Mt Ranier. The hike after Eunice lake becomes bit steep but still doable and view gets nicer. The lookout was crowded with people but there is enough space to sit for everyone on rocks(no at lookout). Bug were bad, didnt let us rest while going up. It got bit cooler due to clouds while coming down so bugs didnt feel that bad while coming down. If you are looking for nice location for lunch around Eunice lake there there are multiple access points to lake almost at the end where trail starts going up. The first access point where you can see the lake while you just come up the trail does not have much space. However bugs makes life miserable everywhere so good luck. My teammate sprayed deet multiple times before hike and during hike but still was bitten through clothes at so many places. This trail requires   and discovery pass or NW forest pass wont help here. once we reached back to our vehicle we saw papers posted on multiple vehicle w. Not sure if it was warning or citation. Didnt get time to read it full but it says if you forgot to hang out National park pass put the pass number in the payment box else you would be fined(not sure about exact details as didnt take photo of that) but it did have some number written by hand on it so it was not just informational I guess.

Esmeralda Basin (Esmerelda)	Willow's Humans	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	We took Willow on a dry, smoky hike to Lake Ann and Esmeralda Basin. Got to the trailhead at 6:45 on Saturday, and the parking lot was full so we parked along the road. Fortunately for us, everyone was at Lake Ingalls instead! The trail is in good shape (although pretty rocky) with several small stream crossings that probably felt great on hot dry paws. We enjoyed splashing through them as well. Quite a few wildflowers blooming all the way to the ridge. We could see Mt. Daniel and other peaks once we got there, but it was pretty hazy. We took the trail to Lake Ann and went down to the lake. Willow jumped in briefly, but was more interested in sniffing around the plants and rocks. It wasn't as pretty and scenic as I'm sure Ingalls is (we haven't been yet, but it's on our list!) but it was so nice to have the trail and lake to ourselves. We only saw a few groups as we hiked back out. Definitely watch your dog's paws on all of the rocks. Willow seemed okay, but she did stop a few times and tried to walk alongside the trail instead of on the rocks. Bring plenty of water/electrolytes, as it is very dry and probably will be smoky for most of the summer. 	Aug 04, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-05.7393509575
Eagle Peak Saddle	Robak718	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	Great hike! Mostly shaded until the top which was nice for a hot day. Also, there wasn't much traffic on the trail at all, which was nice considering that the ranger described Paradise on a Saturday in August as "the New York Subway" when it came to crowds. 	Aug 04, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-05.6739423791

Third Beach	T-Town Family	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Our time at Third Beach was cut very short after our 4yr old daughter stepped on an old campfire and received 2nd degree burns on her foot.  This happened 30 min after we arrived!  We had to carry her out and ended up driving all the way back to Tacoma.  What should have been an awesome backpacking  trip ended terribly.  This beach is very popular with many young visitors.      	Aug 04, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-05.2559254211

Lake 22	jdelosada	Minor obstacles posing few problems	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	It was a busy day yesterday on the trail, probably due to a combination of cooler weather, WTA Trail Day post, and the ubiquitous "green shirt-people" (like me) completing their 5th hike in the United General Hospital Trek for Treasure series. The views were stunning and the bugs almost nonexistent until we stopped at the lake for lunch (and only a minor nusance then). My only concern is that there are quite a few 6-8 inch root tips poking up along the trail. My foot caught one a I fell like a tree, smashing to the ground pretty dramatically. No major injuries, and one can expect these kind of things from time to time when hiking. Nonetheless, there were more of these trip hazards than I normally see on trails. Wish I took a picture of what I'm talking about, I guess the breathtaking views were calling to me and my camera more. 	Aug 04, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-05.4113092243
Mount Catherine	To trudge	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	No bugs	Snow free	Mount Catherine has been on my list of hikes to do for quite some time and I couldn't have picked a better day to reach the summit!   Finding Rd 9070 can be a little tricky.  The secret is to drive to Hyak and stay left on the through road.  You will pass a water treatment facility and from there you are on 9070.  About 1.5 miles before the trailhead you will come upon some pretty rough road.  Several people park on this curve in the road fearing that they can't make it through this rough part of the road.  Take it slow and have some ground clearance and you can make it.   The trail head is easy to pass.  It will be on your right about 1.5 miles from the rough section of road.  If you get to the PCT you have gone to far. The first part of the hike is on rough, loose rock but soon changes to nice and sometimes steep trail conditions.  After a few switchbacks you are rewarded with amazing views of Snoqualmie Mt., Red Mountain and more. With about 20' remaining to the summit you will find two paths to the summit, a class 2 scramble and a trail with a cable running along it that you can use to assist your ascent. At the summit you will see several bolts and cables that remain from 1920's navigation aids. #hikingthestate #hikeathon	Aug 04, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-05.2970702939
Burroughs Mountain	Alien Dave	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	We've enjoyed Burroughs III for more than a decade now.  WTA used to indicate that the maintained trail stopped at Burroughs II - until a year or two ago.  I suspect that helped keep traffic to/at Burroughs III down quite a bit.  It is as wonderful a day hike as there is, anywhere.  I heartily recommend it.  There are a couple of notes I will add, however: 1.  At least on summer weekends, it's no longer a quiet, majestic place of solitude perched atop the Winthrop Glacier staring at the massive summit of Rainier.  The place where it's so quiet and peaceful you hear the screes of falcons overhead, and the distant cracking and rumbling of the glacier over 1500' below and the continual and sometimes thunderous decomposition of the Russell Cliffs on the other side of the Winthrop - and almost never a human voice.  People used to without exception quietly seek resting places far from anyone else who happened to be visiting.  The outcropping of sharp boulders along the top of Burroughs III that forms the best Rainier viewpoints in the park has many nooks and crannies that allow/allowed you to feel all alone when there may be as many as thirty or more visitors up there with you.  Any conversations were in whispers or in very quiet voices.  The experience is SO much better when those who choose to come here adhere to this seemingly unspoken tradition.     I understand the elation that people can feel upon seeing such views and simply finishing the fairly long trek to the top of the "last" Burroughs peak.  But in recent visits, there have been larger groups of people who loudly carried on conversations they might have had in the parking lot.  Some seem to think nothing of shouting inane nothings at the tops of their lungs from this incredible perch.  While anyone is free to behave in this manner, I encourage all to consider a modicum of respect for others in this amazing space -    .  2.  Now that the WTA has seen fit to write the Burroughs Mountain hiking guide entry to include Burroughs III - please update the data regarding the hike to show a 9 mile RT with 2500' of elevation gain.  There were a number of hikers along the way who clearly had read your guide and were stunned that 1450' of elevation gain felt so challenging.  When we told them it was 2500', not 1450', they were pretty frustrated.  I and many others continue to sing the WTA's praises - but please either get the data right, or go back to omitting Burroughs III from the guide description and refer to it as "unmaintained trail" or something. Of course, this is my very selfish wish.  I can - and will - make sure to only visit on a weekday on any future trip (unless taking weekend visitors). Burroughs II is wonderful.  III is beyond wonderful.  Here's hoping that somehow, it remains such an experience for all who visit.

Eightmile Lake	whisperwillow45	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	Arrived to the trail head at 10am and secured the last parking spot. The air quality was a little hazy but nothing out of the usual for August. There were a lot of flies but regular application of bugs spray kept them away. The trail does have 6' tall fireweed patches throughout the hike, so bring your epi if you need it. There are some loose snags in the burned stands so keep your head up, just in case.  It seems that most people backpack this part of the enchantments so foot traffic is high in the early morning and afternoon. So day hikers get the trail to themselves!	Aug 04, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-04.5584344338
Monogram Lake	lomorg	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Wanted to do lookout mountain lookout but due to the haze decided on going to the lake (which is a little more difficult). However, there are such amazing mountain views on the way to the lake that we wished it weren't that hazy. A lot of flies from the meadows onward but they didn't bite so not a real problem. Getting to the lake took 3.5 hours. Getting back to the car took 2.5 hours. Recommend climbing a few steps after the lake (When you reach the lake, the trail that goes to the left) to get nice views of the lake with the surrounding mountain (see first pic) 	Aug 04, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-04.9474160663
Summerland - Panhandle Gap	R2T2	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were terrible	Snowfields to cross - could be difficult	 Arrived at the White River Entrance Station about 8:30am to find there was already a long line of cars and a 20 minute wait to get in. Trailhead parking was also packed, so we wound up parking about a half mile uphill.  Trail's in really good shape... all the water crossings were easily traversed, although boots and poles definitely help keep the feet dry and happy. Bugs are really bad from about a mile in all the way to Summerland.   There's a Washington Conservation Corps crew working past the Fryingpan Creek crossing. They were laying in new steps today and said they'd be working up there most of this coming week. If I'd known they'd be up there, I would have brought some extra water or a snack to leave with them.    Flowers are still blooming at Summerland, but they may be beginning to pass their peak in the coming weeks. Spotted a couple of Marmots in the boulders just past Summerland. There was a rumor of a Wolverine around, but we never saw it.   The falls below the glacier are running strong. There's a sturdy log bridge to cross here. About 200 yards downstream, you can see what appears to be the remnants of a previous, larger bridge.   We didn't make it all the way up to Panhandle Gap, as the clouds were beginning to roll in, and climbing on the ice during a thunderstorm did not seem like a good choice.   So we turned around and started back down, just making it back below the treeline when the lightning and thunder started. The trees shielded us from the rain, only allowing a little drizzly mist through. We could hear the storm intensifying behind us all the way back to the car. Surprisingly, there were many people still heading up the trail, despite the inclement weather.   All in, we clocked just under 11 miles, with about 2,400ft. of elevation. 	Aug 04, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-04.0189195232
Ebey Waterfront Trail	Cagey	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Holy moly traffic was lousy on south I-5.  I had had enough so I exited at Marysville 199 and hit the trail at Ebey’s waterfront trail.  Note that the parking lot is directly across from the marysville car and truck center (I got confused and had to turn around once...almost twice).  I followed the brown signs that indicated the way to the trail- which led me across State Ave (hwy 529) and then south to the trail.  Only when I got to the T in the trail did I realize there are two ways to access it: one is to cross State Ave (hwy 529) and walk south, the second (easier way) is to find the trail in the parking lot just north of the boat launch and gounder the State Ave (hwy 529) bridge.  I got to the T in the trailhead just beforehand 4pm and it was toasty.   There is very little shade, no water sources and the entire way is paved.  Along the trail, I saw California seagulls, a blue heron, a red wing black bird, an eagle, crows and mallard duckies.  There were a few boaters on the water.  It was neat to see an area I have only previously seen from I-5!   Happy hiking.

Northern State Ghost Town	Cagey	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	I found myself running errands in Sedro Woolley and it hit me that I was pup and fiancé free for the day.  So!  I decided to hit some easy (read: flip flop friendly) trails.  I got a take out lunch from Liberty Bistro and had a picnic lunch at Northern State Ghost town.  The parking lot was large and only partly full when I rolled in at 1:30pm (it was shaping up to be a hot afternoon).  I walked about 2.6 miles by following the double track road (some gravel, some grass and some pavement) around the perimeter of the ghost town.  There is a map at the parking lot, which is incredibly helpful, since there are quite a few boot paths one could follow.  There is a lovely bridge that crosses a stream (kids were splashing around and I really wanted to join in!).  The interpretive signs gave insight into some of the buildings still standing.  A golden crown kinglet played peek a boo in the reeds.  Some fireweed and thistle are still blooming.  There are ripe blackberries all over.   A hand full of people were playing frisbee golf and another ten or so were walking the trails.  Lots of scat (horse, coyote, and raccoon) on the double track road.  All in all a lovely trek, completely doable in flip flops and street wear.   Happy hiking!

Blanca Lake	Homegirl	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Hit the trail at the gate at 6 this morning. We made it to the actual trailhead at 6:45; the lake by 9:00; and back to the car at 10:45. By my phone’s count this was a total of 13 miles. The lake probably would’ve been brighter looking and much warmer if we had gone later, after the clouds had cleared, but it was beautiful nonetheless. Foot traffic was considerably heavier on our way back down - we passed several large groups. I loved the time we chose to go on this because it was cool enough not to get overheated - it just got a bit chilly at the lake.

Big Beaver Pond	Evergreen Awakening	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	I went out for a peaceful morning hike in the Anacortes Community Forest Lands out toward the Beaver Ponds. These ponds lie just on the backside of Little Cranberry Lake, and you can actually continue the trail to Little Cranberry if you so desire. I enjoyed looking for birds and summer mushrooms on this quiet trail. ACFL Trail 10 takes you out past several ponds and wetlands, include Mitten Pond, Little Beaver Pond, and Big Beaver Pond. There are plenty of side trails, including one that switchbacks you up to a ridge with a bit of elevation gain. There wasn't much of a view in the early morning fog. However, this soon burned off. Along the trail I saw a Hairy Woodpecker and what I believe was a Brown Creeper. Swallows flit above the ponds. There is also a beaver lodge in the middle of Big Beaver Pond (fancy that) and you could see signs of their lumber work around.  The ponds themselves are covered with pond lillies, surrounded by skunk cabbage and little flowers.  On this route, I particularly enjoy looking for mushrooms and identifying them. I'm a bit of a fungi nerd. One of my favorite finds was some young Chicken of the Woods mushrooms, which are bright orange and yellow! If you're looking for a quiet trail for hiking, birdwatching, or mountain-biking, this is a good one. Great way to start the day!

Norway Pass	fineff5	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Started at the Norway Pass trailhead at around 10am and hiked the Boundary Trail to Mount Margaret.  There were only 10-12 cars in the parking lot when we got there, and we only ran into 3-4 groups on the trail. From the trailhead, the trail climbs steadily all the way up to Norway Pass, with occasional views of Mt Rainier and Adams. After Norway Pass, we had awesome views of Mt St Helens for the rest of the way - and from Mount Margaret, we could also see Mt Rainier and Adams in the distance. Wildflowers were incredible, some bugs on the way back but not many mosquitoes. Overall, a great hike, especially on a clear and sunny day! Bring lots of water and sunscreen.

Rampart Ridge Loop	SnohJoe	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	I was near the park for the afternoon and wanted a short walk before heading home. This loop fit the bill perfectly. Started from Longmire in the evening and had the entire loop to myself. It is a walk in the woods with two brief moments of great views. Consistently steep from the Longmire side but in a very open-feeling woods the trail finally makes a sharp right atop the ridge, with the sun setting thru the trees. A short distance farther showed a rainbow over Longmire. Another short distance provided the only glimpse of the mountain along the loop. From there it was a gentle downward slope to the intersection with the Wonderland Trail. The descent from there was steep at times on a trail that must see a lot of traffic.

Lake of the Angels	Weatherbow21	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were terrible	Snow free	Two of us camped at the trailhead and started off early saturday morning to avoid crowds and the heat. The hike was great, trail was in good condition and as always the scenery up there was beautiful. It was a busy day with other hikers and all were courteous... except the large group of hammock campers who chose to set up their hammocks across the trail and then sleep in so all of us trying to use the trail had to try and find a route around them? Never seen anything like that before. Between the black flys and mosquitoes I was very glad to have plenty of bug spray with me, they were thick.  	Aug 04, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-08.3714996726
Mount Ellinor	TahneeO	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	No bugs	Snow free	Congrats to everyone doing the race at Ellinor, that was super motivating for me as I crawled along. We started at the lower trailhead at 8am, and only had 2 other cars. I think most people try to start at the upper trailhead, which I realized later is smart. The stretch from the lower trailhead to upper is nice and easy and minimal elevation gain. After that it's game on. I'm a moderate hiker, we managed the summit in about 3 hours. My dogs are very athletic but even they were tired after that. Unfortunately the clouds rolled in so we couldn't see the lake, but we had a view on the other side, and saw a couple goats! Biggest thing, bring a lot of water. And if you hike with dogs, bring more than you think they will need. Mine went through almost 3 liters just between the two of them and it was only about 70 degree's.  	Aug 04, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-08.2416695313
Mink Lake	mseawise	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	Great first overnight for my 12 year old son. Would highly recommend it! Bring bug spray (flies and mosquitoes). Rocky, rooty trail. The forest on the trail is beautiful. Although it's very rocky and rooty. That slowed our pace in both directions. It's a steady 2.5 miles uphill to the lake. It was gradual enough for me, but my son was feeling it. This was his first hike with a loaded pack. He mustered through just fine, taking short pauses periodically. I let him lead so that he controlled the pace. There's a spot where a large tree has fallen across the trail. We sat on it and swiveled our legs across. Not a big deal. It took us about 2 hours to get to the lake, which included a short snack break. It took 45 minutes to hike back out. The lake is gorgeous. It's small, shallow and quiet. The water is so clear you can readily see the bottom. Lots of trout. They were constantly jumping at bugs on the surface. It got buggy with flies and mosquitoes, so bring a repellent that handles both. There's a small stream feeding into the lake. We got our water to filter from there. Camping is permitted at established sites only. Mink Lake has just three. We were glad we started early on Saturday morning. One site was already taken (the one with a small shelter). Of the remaining two, one was very small with barely enough room for a tent. We opted for the third site for it's roominess and suitable tree spacing for our hammocks. Later that afternoon, a couple came through and were disappointed they got stuck with the tiny site. IMPORTANT: This time of year, ALL camping in and around the Olympic National Park is popular. That includes DNR, state and county parks. It also includes hotels. We couldn't find camping for Friday night and almost all hotels in both Port Angeles and Sequim were booked. We thought we might have to snooze in the car. Luckily we found a room at the Flagstone Motel. The two other hotels with vacancy were well over $200 per night. We got the Flagstone for about $170. It was clean, simple and comfortable. Also, the WIC currently is open 8AM to 6PM on Fridays (and I believe the weekend). However, it was confusing when we got there just past 5PM, because part of that facility closes at 5PM. There's a sign directing backpackers to the front of the building which gets locked at 5PM. So, you have to go in through the back. Some people drove away not realizing the alternate entrance. Inside, the line was long and there were only two rangers assisting people for permits and bear canisters. When we got there, there was a gentleman planning a big trip. He monopolized one ranger for at least 30 minutes. It was a good exercise in patience. 	Aug 04, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-07.3557592684

Pyramid Peak	onemorehike	Minor obstacles posing few problems	Road rough but passable	No bugs	Snow free	Another gorgeous day in the PNW.  Once the road started gaining elevation the views of Rainier, other peaks and valleys were stupendous.  We tried to follow the directions but could not find the place where the PCT crossed the road.  After driving the last road mentioned and not seeing a trail, we went back to the beginning, parked and walked it.  It initially heads mostly west and part way down the road is a small parking lot. We continued and at a place where the road turns north we found a faint trail heading gradually down, about WSW.  After perhaps 100 yards it intersected with the PCT.  The PCT heads gradually downward through thick forest as the description indicates.  We were wondering if we'd find the trail to the peak but our GPS device indicated to keep going.  Finally, we saw a somewhat faint trail heading uphill at a right angle to the PCT.  There were many trees over the trail, but easy to get over or around. At times huckleberry bushes obscured the trail but that was not a big issue.  The trail to the peak is steep we eventually broke out of the vegetation to the rocky old lookout site and an 180 degree view looking west towards Rainier. 	Aug 04, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-06.1975521018

Apple Capital Recreation Loop Trail	ToddlerTrekking	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	We explored a bit of the Apple Capital Trail while camping at Wenatchee Confluence State Park. It was a nice, wide, flat, paved trail running right along the rivers and through the state park. The bugs were surprisingly almost nonexistant despite walking at twilight. This summer, my four-year-old son and I are hiking to raise money for Washington Trails Association. Please consider donating to one of our Hike-A-Thons at the below links. Thank you and Happy Hiking! #hikeathon #watrailsday	Aug 04, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-06.8042967965
Lower Big Quilcene River	Oly_hiker	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	This was the best berry hike I've ever had. Huckleberries, thimbleberries, and even salmon berries were abundant, especially between Bark Shanty and Camp Jolley. Unlike anything I've ever experienced in the Olympics. It makes what should be a pretty quick cruiser even if kids a long hike. It's so hard to pass up those berries! Surprisingly, the trail was pretty empty. There were 7 cars (including ours) in the lot when we hiked out mid-day Sunday. And aside from a couple trail-runners, we didn't encounter anyone between Bark Shanty and Camp Jolley. The trail itself is in great shape. There a re a few beautiful new bridges at the crossings and diligent trail crews have cleared out any and all obstacles that were present earlier in the season. We did this as a 6-person overnight at Camp Jolley. Unlike the wide open spots at Bark Shanty, Camp Jolley is less ideal for a group camping set-up. We camped at the first of the three established sites, and it was a squeeze to get our two tens (one was 4 person, one was 2 person) into the site. The site itself is great in terms of access to the river and comfortable seating. The bugs were an annoyance, but not unbearable. All-in-all, an easy way to get out into the forest overnight and stretch the legs a bit.	Aug 04, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-06.8555448680
Barnes Creek	illahee3103	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	With the Elwha road closed, hiking in to Boulder Lake via the Barnes Creek and the Happy Lake Ridge trails seemed like the next best option.  Elevation gain on the Barnes Creek trail to it's intersection with the Happy Lake Ridge trail at the Aurora Divide is about 4,000 ft. The first couple of miles more or less follow Barnes Creek with minimal elevation gain.  After this, the grade is moderate and the climb fairly steady on a well engineered trail with many switchbacks.  The Barnes Creek trail is in excellent condition; a generally smooth path with little erosion.  Once past the Marymere Falls junction, It shows modest-to-little signs of use, but has been cleared of blow-downs.  The Happy Lakes Ridge trail from Aurora Divide to the Boulder Lake/Happy Lake junction is in good condition.  It has been cleared of blow-downs.  Other than some brush growing out into the footpath it is easy to follow, but clearly gets little traffic.  From the junction the trail to Boulder Lake is in good condition with no blow-downs.  We parked at the Storm King Ranger Station.  Hike is 12 miles one-way and took us 6:45 going in and a little less than 6:00 on the return.  Water was available behind a campsite at about mile 7 on the Barnes Creek trail a few hundred feet below the Aurora Divide.  We stopped here for lunch both directions.  	Aug 04, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-06.5032535093
Mount Pugh	tiffanyc	Obstacles on trail:	    Trees down across trail,	    Muddy or wet trail,	    Overgrown in places.		Aug 04, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-05.0851229195
Bedal Basin	matt030709	Trail difficult/impossible to navigate:	    Muddy or wet trail,	    Overgrown in places,	    Mud/Rock slide or washout.	First off, the road is quite rough and steep, although there aren't many pot holes or washouts, so clearance wasn't an issue. The biggest problem is the steepness and loose rocks. My tires slipped a couple of times and I had to be careful going down to not gather too much speed. For this reason, I'd recommend a 4 wheel drive vehicle. The worst part is right before and right after the 5th switch back (the last left hander). There's a place to park right before that, so if you don't feel comfortable, I'd recommend parking there and walking (probably about a mile from there, there were about 3 cars there on my way back). The second thing about the road is that it does not match google maps at all. Its signed for FR 4096, so its easy to find. If you have the Green Trails Map, its exactly as drawn there.  When you get to the trail head, don't continue to follow the road. The trail is to the left, maybe 10 feet before the fire pit. Its marked with a "temporary" trail sign and several orange and pink markers. I made the mistake of hiking down the road last year and never found the actual trail. The first mile and a half of trail is in pretty good shape. There were probably something like a dozen blowdowns, nothing impossible to get over. The tread is good and easy to follow. However, the brush is quite thick in sections (nettles, raspberries, bracken, etc.). It was also very wet. Unless a trail crew beats back the brush, I'd strongly recommend long pants and long sleeves. One the way in, I did note the climbers route, its well marked and off to the left. The creek crossings before Bedal Creek were no problem. Once you get to Bedal Creek, as the guide book (Day Hiking: North Cascades is what I'm referring to here) says, things get a bit more interesting. The creek itself is not hard to cross at this time. However, the banks can be steep and full of loose rocks. There is a marker across the creek, which I didn't see on the way in, but if you do see it, cross approximately there and go perpendicular to the stream to find a trail. You will find an actually trail there and that is easy to follow and takes you up between the two creeks as the guide book says. Unfortunately, I didn't find that until the way back. On the way up, I basically followed the creek bank, alternating between banks when possible or sometimes just up the creek. Its quite slippery, so be careful (also just use the trail I mentioned above). There was still some snow on the banks. The "lone big yellow cedar" is still there, you can't miss it. When you see that, make sure you are on the right bank. Just above that look for a cairn to the right near the bushes that takes you onto an actual trail again. That trail is quite overgrown and marked with cairns at times. It does go up a small creek at one point. Keep looking for cairns. Unfortunately, at the end of that part, it looks like the trail has slid into the creek. I think this is right were the guidebook says the trail should go back into the woods and up into the basin. I was at 4450' and could see the side creek, but I couldn't find a way to climb the creek banks or locate the trail into the forest. So this was my stopping point. It might have been possible to bushwhack or scramble, but I was tired at that point and there was a decent view of Mt Forgotten and Sloan Peak. I know I was close to the basin, but hopefully there wasn't an 'easy' way that I just missed (please let me know if there was).  On the way back, I stuck to the dry rocky creek bed, which is marked with cairns. I didn't see the entrance to the trail between the creeks, so I ended up going down the other creek. That wasn't fun, so I eventually decided to head perpendicular to get back to the northern Bedal creek. There I found the trail and used that. So, I imaging if you used that trail in the first place, then you would know where it comes out into the rocky creek bed.  This trail really isn't too hard if you know where you're going. But that's easier said than done once you get to the Bedal Creek. However, the views are really good. Its also a good place for privacy as I saw only three other groups. Hopefully someday the Forest Service will fix up the road and the last part of the trail. When they do, I'll be back.

Spectacle Lake	michaelw81	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	Beautiful Hike to Spectacle Lake. A warm, sunny, day with great views at Pete Lake, and then beautiful views to help off-set the tough climb up to Spectacle via the PCT. The trail is in great shape, and the water crossing is not bad(knee deep in places, but with poles it was completely do-able--I'm 5'9" for reference). Lake was crowded, but we were able to find a nice spot to camp. Ranger who we spoke with let us know that she just dug a new hole for the privy! Bugs were pretty bad, but I've definitely experienced worse. Nice hike out in the morning, with a stop for iced coffee in Cle Elum before the drive home. A nice way to avoid Seafair Weekend in Seattle! 	Aug 04, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-05.2814903961
Capitol State Forest - Waddell Basin West	Trey715	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Our first venture into the Capitol State Forest. There were a few off-road vehicles on the trail, but they were always nice when they approached us and passed with care. Nonetheless, I think next time we’ll do one of the trails that don’t allow ATVs. There were a lot of blackberries to eat.

Round Lake	Snofzig	Obstacles on trail:	    Trees down across trail.	Road rough but passable	Bugs were not too bad	This was quite the journey, but I was able to squeeze it in before sunset, and boy am I glad I did. The drive up is pretty decent in most places, especially given that it involved about 10 miles of gravel roads along mountain loop highway, and then North fork sauk road. The only sketchy area is once you turn on to the North Fork Sauk road, about 1 ish miles from the trailhead, there is a large rock field. It looks fairly daunting, although the Forest Service Ranger who crossed it before me said that he'd seen smaller cars than my 99' accord cross it, and I was able to without an issue. Just take it slow and be careful, and you should be okay. The trailhead doesn't have much parking, but it doesn't seem to be a super popular trail so that shouldn't be too big of an issue. The trail itself is nice, although you do have to really duck/scoot your way under a large tree that has fallen across the trail about a mile or so in. Parts of it have been cut out so it is passable, just a bit obnoxious. The trail is sort of monotonous for the first bit, involving plenty of switchbacks as you gain lots of elevation. Once it eventually opens up into more of a meadow you get to reap the rewards for your thigh's labor. The views are amazing, and walking along the ridge is great, especially if there is a little bit of a breeze to cool you off on a hot day, and to keep the bugs somewhat off you. The bugs aren't a huge issue on the hike, but they are definitely present and you will notice them. I would highly recommend spray, but just be prepared to be mildly annoyed by their buzzing. You will encounter a Y-shaped split in the trail once you have crossed part of the ridge. To go to the lake you want to take the left branch, which will be angled slightly upwards, whereas the right fork angles downwards. I don't know where the right fork goes, but to get to the lake you want to go left. A little bit later you will get your first glimpse of the lake. This is where I turned around for the day, and although the basin that holds the lake looks beautiful, I didn't really have the time to go and explore further. The trail heading down to the lake (to complete the 11 mile round-trip) looks to be in good condition, and seems to nicely meander along the basin. I definitely went pretty fast on my descent in order to get to the car before sunset, but I am glad I was able to squeeze this hike in. Overall it makes a nice day hike, and somewhere I would definitely like to return to someday. Hike took 4 hours 20 minutes.

Mount Aix	ThePigMan	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	The road to the trailhead, which is a well-placed and noticeable sign, was easily passable with the ~10 inches of clearance on my vehicle. The first 2/3rds of the trail were climbing switchbacks. After some time bumping lake is visible, then Mt. Rainier, then much of the East Cascades. At the top of the switchback climb there is a wooden sign that points the way towards either Mt. Aix (to the right) or Nelson Point (to the left).  Once you approach the summit there are two trail options. The first (left side trail) is the scramble up. The second (right side trail) is much less steep approach to the summit that takes you all the way around the back side of the mountain before it ascends again. Our party scrambled up, but decided to take the trail down. I have little climbing experience, so I found the scramble to be nerve-racking. I certainly wouldn't take any children or inexperienced hikers up the scramble. However, the summit is nice and flat on top and well-suited for a lunch break or picture taking.

Oyster Dome	carol	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Beautiful day in the Chuckanuts. Don't know why I've never chosen one of these hikes before. Except for a single, sandy, heavily washboarded turn, the gravel road was in fine shape. Arrived 1pm and found a parking spot in lot. Sunny, 75-ish, gorgeous blue sky and water, 95% of the trail in the shade of lushly-ferned forest. Hikers were well spread out, of all ages, and happy! Lots of well-behaved dogs including a 10-week old puppy that made his own way up and down and stole the show at the dome. The view is amazing though I couldn't capture it photographically. 	Aug 04, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-05.4448545095

Cherry Creek Falls	TiffanyBerry	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Road work appears to be done here, and though the parking lot was very busy, there was room for about a dozen cars. It's a fairly straightforward trail with a mild incline, and plenty of mild up/down stuff.  There are two stretches that are very short (a couple steps) but very steep and (in this weather) dry and slippery, so mind that.   The falls aren't very active any longer, but there's enough water to play in, and for adults to stand calf deep at the most. Otherwise, it's a nice walk through a mostly shaded trail with thimbleberries EVERYWHERE right now.	Aug 04, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-04.6993053539
Beckler Peak	Thor-in-Boots	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	No bugs	Snow free	Turn-off does come quick off US-2. Almost witnessed a major collision with a semi after a small car (who had missed the turn) attempted to swerve back across the road...don't do that :) First two miles of the road is the most heavily potholed. It is a (relatively) long service road so prepare to add some time onto your travel, especially if you get behind a slower moving vehicle. Trail is in great condition. One minor washout a little less than a mile in. Great tree cover throughout. I mentioned to my hiking buddy that the 2300 ft of gain was the easiest 2300 I have ever climbed; the trail is so well graded that it felt like a breeze.  Summit had amazing views today and accommodated a large group. Found a phone on the middle of the trail heading back. Placed in the black register at the trailhead. Hoping it made it back to its owner.

Apple Capital Recreation Loop Trail	ToddlerTrekking	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	We explored a bit of the Apple Capital Trail while camping at Wenatchee Confluence State Park. It was a nice, wide, flat, paved trail running right along the rivers and through the state park. The bugs were surprisingly almost nonexistant despite walking at twilight. This summer, my four-year-old son and I are hiking to raise money for Washington Trails Association. Please consider donating to one of our Hike-A-Thons at the below links. Thank you and Happy Hiking! #hikeathon #watrailsday	Aug 04, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-06.8042967965
Lower Big Quilcene River	Oly_hiker	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	This was the best berry hike I've ever had. Huckleberries, thimbleberries, and even salmon berries were abundant, especially between Bark Shanty and Camp Jolley. Unlike anything I've ever experienced in the Olympics. It makes what should be a pretty quick cruiser even if kids a long hike. It's so hard to pass up those berries! Surprisingly, the trail was pretty empty. There were 7 cars (including ours) in the lot when we hiked out mid-day Sunday. And aside from a couple trail-runners, we didn't encounter anyone between Bark Shanty and Camp Jolley. The trail itself is in great shape. There a re a few beautiful new bridges at the crossings and diligent trail crews have cleared out any and all obstacles that were present earlier in the season. We did this as a 6-person overnight at Camp Jolley. Unlike the wide open spots at Bark Shanty, Camp Jolley is less ideal for a group camping set-up. We camped at the first of the three established sites, and it was a squeeze to get our two tens (one was 4 person, one was 2 person) into the site. The site itself is great in terms of access to the river and comfortable seating. The bugs were an annoyance, but not unbearable. All-in-all, an easy way to get out into the forest overnight and stretch the legs a bit.	Aug 04, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-06.8555448680
Barnes Creek	illahee3103	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	With the Elwha road closed, hiking in to Boulder Lake via the Barnes Creek and the Happy Lake Ridge trails seemed like the next best option.  Elevation gain on the Barnes Creek trail to it's intersection with the Happy Lake Ridge trail at the Aurora Divide is about 4,000 ft. The first couple of miles more or less follow Barnes Creek with minimal elevation gain.  After this, the grade is moderate and the climb fairly steady on a well engineered trail with many switchbacks.  The Barnes Creek trail is in excellent condition; a generally smooth path with little erosion.  Once past the Marymere Falls junction, It shows modest-to-little signs of use, but has been cleared of blow-downs.  The Happy Lakes Ridge trail from Aurora Divide to the Boulder Lake/Happy Lake junction is in good condition.  It has been cleared of blow-downs.  Other than some brush growing out into the footpath it is easy to follow, but clearly gets little traffic.  From the junction the trail to Boulder Lake is in good condition with no blow-downs.  We parked at the Storm King Ranger Station.  Hike is 12 miles one-way and took us 6:45 going in and a little less than 6:00 on the return.  Water was available behind a campsite at about mile 7 on the Barnes Creek trail a few hundred feet below the Aurora Divide.  We stopped here for lunch both directions.  	Aug 04, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-06.5032535093
Mount Pugh	tiffanyc	Obstacles on trail:	    Trees down across trail,	    Muddy or wet trail,	    Overgrown in places.		Aug 04, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-05.0851229195
Bedal Basin	matt030709	Trail difficult/impossible to navigate:	    Muddy or wet trail,	    Overgrown in places,	    Mud/Rock slide or washout.	First off, the road is quite rough and steep, although there aren't many pot holes or washouts, so clearance wasn't an issue. The biggest problem is the steepness and loose rocks. My tires slipped a couple of times and I had to be careful going down to not gather too much speed. For this reason, I'd recommend a 4 wheel drive vehicle. The worst part is right before and right after the 5th switch back (the last left hander). There's a place to park right before that, so if you don't feel comfortable, I'd recommend parking there and walking (probably about a mile from there, there were about 3 cars there on my way back). The second thing about the road is that it does not match google maps at all. Its signed for FR 4096, so its easy to find. If you have the Green Trails Map, its exactly as drawn there.  When you get to the trail head, don't continue to follow the road. The trail is to the left, maybe 10 feet before the fire pit. Its marked with a "temporary" trail sign and several orange and pink markers. I made the mistake of hiking down the road last year and never found the actual trail. The first mile and a half of trail is in pretty good shape. There were probably something like a dozen blowdowns, nothing impossible to get over. The tread is good and easy to follow. However, the brush is quite thick in sections (nettles, raspberries, bracken, etc.). It was also very wet. Unless a trail crew beats back the brush, I'd strongly recommend long pants and long sleeves. One the way in, I did note the climbers route, its well marked and off to the left. The creek crossings before Bedal Creek were no problem. Once you get to Bedal Creek, as the guide book (Day Hiking: North Cascades is what I'm referring to here) says, things get a bit more interesting. The creek itself is not hard to cross at this time. However, the banks can be steep and full of loose rocks. There is a marker across the creek, which I didn't see on the way in, but if you do see it, cross approximately there and go perpendicular to the stream to find a trail. You will find an actually trail there and that is easy to follow and takes you up between the two creeks as the guide book says. Unfortunately, I didn't find that until the way back. On the way up, I basically followed the creek bank, alternating between banks when possible or sometimes just up the creek. Its quite slippery, so be careful (also just use the trail I mentioned above). There was still some snow on the banks. The "lone big yellow cedar" is still there, you can't miss it. When you see that, make sure you are on the right bank. Just above that look for a cairn to the right near the bushes that takes you onto an actual trail again. That trail is quite overgrown and marked with cairns at times. It does go up a small creek at one point. Keep looking for cairns. Unfortunately, at the end of that part, it looks like the trail has slid into the creek. I think this is right were the guidebook says the trail should go back into the woods and up into the basin. I was at 4450' and could see the side creek, but I couldn't find a way to climb the creek banks or locate the trail into the forest. So this was my stopping point. It might have been possible to bushwhack or scramble, but I was tired at that point and there was a decent view of Mt Forgotten and Sloan Peak. I know I was close to the basin, but hopefully there wasn't an 'easy' way that I just missed (please let me know if there was).  On the way back, I stuck to the dry rocky creek bed, which is marked with cairns. I didn't see the entrance to the trail between the creeks, so I ended up going down the other creek. That wasn't fun, so I eventually decided to head perpendicular to get back to the northern Bedal creek. There I found the trail and used that. So, I imaging if you used that trail in the first place, then you would know where it comes out into the rocky creek bed.  This trail really isn't too hard if you know where you're going. But that's easier said than done once you get to the Bedal Creek. However, the views are really good. Its also a good place for privacy as I saw only three other groups. Hopefully someday the Forest Service will fix up the road and the last part of the trail. When they do, I'll be back.

Spectacle Lake	michaelw81	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	Beautiful Hike to Spectacle Lake. A warm, sunny, day with great views at Pete Lake, and then beautiful views to help off-set the tough climb up to Spectacle via the PCT. The trail is in great shape, and the water crossing is not bad(knee deep in places, but with poles it was completely do-able--I'm 5'9" for reference). Lake was crowded, but we were able to find a nice spot to camp. Ranger who we spoke with let us know that she just dug a new hole for the privy! Bugs were pretty bad, but I've definitely experienced worse. Nice hike out in the morning, with a stop for iced coffee in Cle Elum before the drive home. A nice way to avoid Seafair Weekend in Seattle! 	Aug 04, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-05.2814903961
Capitol State Forest - Waddell Basin West	Trey715	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Our first venture into the Capitol State Forest. There were a few off-road vehicles on the trail, but they were always nice when they approached us and passed with care. Nonetheless, I think next time we’ll do one of the trails that don’t allow ATVs. There were a lot of blackberries to eat.

Round Lake	Snofzig	Obstacles on trail:	    Trees down across trail.	Road rough but passable	Bugs were not too bad	This was quite the journey, but I was able to squeeze it in before sunset, and boy am I glad I did. The drive up is pretty decent in most places, especially given that it involved about 10 miles of gravel roads along mountain loop highway, and then North fork sauk road. The only sketchy area is once you turn on to the North Fork Sauk road, about 1 ish miles from the trailhead, there is a large rock field. It looks fairly daunting, although the Forest Service Ranger who crossed it before me said that he'd seen smaller cars than my 99' accord cross it, and I was able to without an issue. Just take it slow and be careful, and you should be okay. The trailhead doesn't have much parking, but it doesn't seem to be a super popular trail so that shouldn't be too big of an issue. The trail itself is nice, although you do have to really duck/scoot your way under a large tree that has fallen across the trail about a mile or so in. Parts of it have been cut out so it is passable, just a bit obnoxious. The trail is sort of monotonous for the first bit, involving plenty of switchbacks as you gain lots of elevation. Once it eventually opens up into more of a meadow you get to reap the rewards for your thigh's labor. The views are amazing, and walking along the ridge is great, especially if there is a little bit of a breeze to cool you off on a hot day, and to keep the bugs somewhat off you. The bugs aren't a huge issue on the hike, but they are definitely present and you will notice them. I would highly recommend spray, but just be prepared to be mildly annoyed by their buzzing. You will encounter a Y-shaped split in the trail once you have crossed part of the ridge. To go to the lake you want to take the left branch, which will be angled slightly upwards, whereas the right fork angles downwards. I don't know where the right fork goes, but to get to the lake you want to go left. A little bit later you will get your first glimpse of the lake. This is where I turned around for the day, and although the basin that holds the lake looks beautiful, I didn't really have the time to go and explore further. The trail heading down to the lake (to complete the 11 mile round-trip) looks to be in good condition, and seems to nicely meander along the basin. I definitely went pretty fast on my descent in order to get to the car before sunset, but I am glad I was able to squeeze this hike in. Overall it makes a nice day hike, and somewhere I would definitely like to return to someday. Hike took 4 hours 20 minutes.

Mount Aix	ThePigMan	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	The road to the trailhead, which is a well-placed and noticeable sign, was easily passable with the ~10 inches of clearance on my vehicle. The first 2/3rds of the trail were climbing switchbacks. After some time bumping lake is visible, then Mt. Rainier, then much of the East Cascades. At the top of the switchback climb there is a wooden sign that points the way towards either Mt. Aix (to the right) or Nelson Point (to the left).  Once you approach the summit there are two trail options. The first (left side trail) is the scramble up. The second (right side trail) is much less steep approach to the summit that takes you all the way around the back side of the mountain before it ascends again. Our party scrambled up, but decided to take the trail down. I have little climbing experience, so I found the scramble to be nerve-racking. I certainly wouldn't take any children or inexperienced hikers up the scramble. However, the summit is nice and flat on top and well-suited for a lunch break or picture taking.

Oyster Dome	carol	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Beautiful day in the Chuckanuts. Don't know why I've never chosen one of these hikes before. Except for a single, sandy, heavily washboarded turn, the gravel road was in fine shape. Arrived 1pm and found a parking spot in lot. Sunny, 75-ish, gorgeous blue sky and water, 95% of the trail in the shade of lushly-ferned forest. Hikers were well spread out, of all ages, and happy! Lots of well-behaved dogs including a 10-week old puppy that made his own way up and down and stole the show at the dome. The view is amazing though I couldn't capture it photographically. 	Aug 04, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-05.4448545095
Snow Lake	DaneBrooks	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	What a great hike fairly easy for a great payoff, we got to the trailhead at 9:30, already fairly busy but not horrible, had a nice chat with the WTA volunteers out there and signed a post card. We had great weather, some bugs but nothing to crazy, was not to busy on the way up but real busy on the way down. Will definitely come back to do some backpacking as there is a string of quite a few lakes to see past snow lake!

High Divide - Seven Lakes Basin Loop	forestbath	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were terrible	Snow free	Wonderful multi day backpacking trip with my adventurous daughter. . Mosquitos were ferocious in the evenings; not so bad in the mornings or when we were on the move. We spent our evenings in full rain gear which worked reasonably well, but I still left the hike with about a hundred new bug bites. However, I would do it again tomorrow. What a place.

Cherry Creek Falls	TiffanyBerry	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Road work appears to be done here, and though the parking lot was very busy, there was room for about a dozen cars. It's a fairly straightforward trail with a mild incline, and plenty of mild up/down stuff.  There are two stretches that are very short (a couple steps) but very steep and (in this weather) dry and slippery, so mind that.   The falls aren't very active any longer, but there's enough water to play in, and for adults to stand calf deep at the most. Otherwise, it's a nice walk through a mostly shaded trail with thimbleberries EVERYWHERE right now.	Aug 04, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-04.6993053539
Beckler Peak	Thor-in-Boots	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	No bugs	Snow free	Turn-off does come quick off US-2. Almost witnessed a major collision with a semi after a small car (who had missed the turn) attempted to swerve back across the road...don't do that :) First two miles of the road is the most heavily potholed. It is a (relatively) long service road so prepare to add some time onto your travel, especially if you get behind a slower moving vehicle. Trail is in great condition. One minor washout a little less than a mile in. Great tree cover throughout. I mentioned to my hiking buddy that the 2300 ft of gain was the easiest 2300 I have ever climbed; the trail is so well graded that it felt like a breeze.  Summit had amazing views today and accommodated a large group. Found a phone on the middle of the trail heading back. Placed in the black register at the trailhead. Hoping it made it back to its owner.

Margaret Lake	Suhleenah	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	I parked at the Mount Margaret trailhead around 830am, it was in the upper 40's, nice and crisp. Despite the weather forecast of mostly cloudy, it was sunny! It's funny that this is the Mount Margaret trailhead, yetthere is no official trail to Mount Margaret, rather, it is the trail to Margaret Lake, Twin Lakes and Lake Lillian ^_^ Ha ha I hiked the following route: TH to Lake Margaret-->Twin Lakes-->Lake Lillian-->Rampart Ridge via the Backdoor-->Rampart Lakes-->Alta Mountain summit-->down a gully near the summit to access the Alta Mountain Tarns-->Rampart Lakes-->up the gully route to Rampart Ridge near the high point-->Lillian Lake, Twin Lakes and back to the TH. this is 18+ miles and close to 7000 gain on rough trails and boot paths.  Conditions of note: There were people yelling WOO. There were PLENTY OF BACKPACKERS camping at Lake Lillian, Rampart Lakes, and Rachel Lake.  There were several parties at Lila Lakes. You might want to spend some time wandering around as it looks like more secluded spots can be available if you expend some extra energy exploring the area. I didn't explore the camping area at Margaret. There were no parties camping at the two lovely campsites right on the shore of Twin lakes.   At Lake Lillian they were even camping on the trail where it meets the lake :/  Lake Lillian does have a few campsites around the lake. It's another place where spending an hour scouting the area could get you a much better campsite than the trail!  The trail from Margaret to Lillian is rough with lots of ups and downs, so is the trail around Rampart Lakes. There are a few trees down but nothing that's a big deal. The trail around the Rampart Lakes can be confusing with the social trails, but I've noticed over several visits that the "main" trail is becoming more so, with branches and rocks blocking some of the side trails. Still, you'll want to pay some attention to where you're going here and not just blindly put one foot after another. The places you can cross streams are all easy right now.  The routes between Lake Lillian and Rampart Lakes are rough bootpaths.  It starts as a single path from Lake Lillian that takes a beeline up steep loose dirt until reaching the ridge, then uphill some more :) The paths split at a junction just after the first ridge lakelet at a stream crossing. One path skirts the ridge on the east side, then curves west and meets a moist meadow near the Rampart Lakes; the other route is more vague in places, following waterways to the saddle near Rampart Ridge's final summit approach and then down a steep gully to Rampart Lakes.  The Alta Mountain trail is a bootpath, it's steep but easy to follow. If you can hike the other trails in the area, odds are you can manage it too :)  I don't recommend the gully near the Alta summit to reach the tarns unless you have appropriate experience. It's loose rock close to the summit ridge so I did some butt scooting and crab walking (only had trail runners and no poles!). The snow is firm but the route did work quite nicely overall, depositing me just on the other side of what I'll call "Alta Tarns Pass".  There's a rough path between the Alta Tarns Pass and the Lila Lake trail that leads through the Alta Tarns. Very beautiful with nice mountain and Lila Lake views.  Great day in the mountains! 	Aug 04, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-04.4332636611
West Fork Foss River and Lakes	Elizabeth “Ducky”	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	First trail party of Hike-a-Thon 2018! Headed up to the West Fork Foss River trail head, there is about 5 and a half miles of dirt gravel roads, that were in pretty good shape. Just a few minor pot-holes, but anyone's car can do it. We had two groups today, one was working on the lower section of trail before the birdge, building a rock wall, and then getting some larger rocks out of the trail. The rest of us, pushed up past Trout Lake a little bit, and started 'brushing' the trail. We took out a lot of Vine Maples that were or close to being over the trail. We also took out tons of blackberries that were sure to be closing in on the trail if not this year, next year for sure. There were a lot of day hikers, and backpackers heading up the trail on this beautiful Seattle day. The trail itself is in pretty good condition, there are a few areas where the trail was a little narrow going between rocks, or over rocks, just watch your footing. A few of us, myself included, slipped on them. All in all a beautiful day for trail work with a great group of people! Come out and join us sometime, wta.org/volunteer. If you've ever seen us out on the trail we are all volunteers, and WTA is funded by donations, August happens to be WTA's biggest fundraiser- Hike-a-Thon, if you haven't already any amount is worthwhile, and you can sponsor me by going to give.wta.org/ElizabethHikes Lots of people out on the trails today, I can only imagine it was due to the beautiful weather, and that it happened to have been #WATRAILSDAY	Aug 04, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-04.3428991681
Scorpion Mountain	Stewart W	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Road driving in is in excellent condition.  Trail is in great condition (a bit rough at the beginning). Really nice forest hike initially and then great meadow and views from the top.  The mosquitoes were out at the meadow at the top of Scorpion.  I didn't mind them, but my canine companion was not impressed.  I think this hike is definitely worthwhile if you are going all the way to Scorpion.  I was less impressed with the views mid-way on Johnson Ridge. There is a fair amount of up and down and compared to some trails the down parts can be somewhat steep and slippery.  Definitely a good trail for using hiking poles.  Strava recorded the total vertical as 2900 ft over 8.5 miles.  That would include the all the ups (not just net from bottom to top).

Cowiche Canyon	mytho-man	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	As we're having a mid-80s respite for a few days between a couple of weeks of 90s & triple digits, I decided to celebrate National Trails Day with an afternoon walk in Cowiche Canyon.  It's nice and green along the creek, but the hillsides are mostly brown.  Not the best time of year for the canyon, but always a nice walk if the temperatures are tolerable.

Mount Washington	dromanski	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	This was my first time hiking the Mount Washington trail as I just moved from OH and it was beautiful! The trail was in a pretty good condition, but I think it could be marked a little better. I followed a maps.me trail map which was suggested to me and it pointed my to a trail that was probably not used in a while as it became very steep before meeting back up with the actual trail. All in all, it is a gorgeous trail and the weather was perfect! 	Aug 04, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-04.3400107113
Big Finn Hill Park	cshowalter1	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Did a trail run with my dog and my friend and her dog between these two parks.  Beautiful day and perfect temperature.  No bugs!   This was my first time out here.  There are lots of small little trails and not all are marked.  This made it somewhat frustrating to navigate through these two parks.  We pulled up google maps multiple times to figure out where we were and how to get around.  There were also several sign posts that we did end up stopping at as well.   The trails them selves are a mix of gravel and dirt paths.  Most of them were pretty narrow making. it a challenge to run with our pups.  The beach access at Blake Edwards is pretty small and was very busy so we didn't stay long.  	Aug 04, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-04.9815100891
Oyster Dome	XplorerMike	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Oyster Dome Loop Trail Distance: 8.5 ~ 9.0 mi Start: 7:15a from Chuckanut Dr trailhead End: 11:10a Parking: I arrived early to get a spot along Chuckanut Dr. I think it can accommodate about 15 cars along the shoulder. When I finished, I saw plenty to spots still open near the trailhead...so, your call. TrailHead:  The start is at the school bus stop sign...really. The trail starts the accent immediately at a 15-20% grade (sometimes 40%). Granted you'll go through 4 switchback for about roughly 1.7 miles at about 1120 ft gain as you reach the junction to go right to the Samish overlook or go left/straight up to the Oyster Dome (1.2 mi further to another junction). Keep in mind Oyster Dome peaks at 2080 ft after a total 3.1 mi...so another 900 ft gain to go from there. Note: there are doing some sales activity so M-F the direct Oyster dome trail is closed (until 8/10/2018) and you'll need to go the Samish lookout way to get to the dome. Luckily, Sat-Sun it is open. I posted a pic here with the sign. Continuing on, as I did the loop, I went towards the Oyster Dome, then up to Lily Lake (ehh - not really exciting), then back down Max's shortcut trail then Larry Reed trail to the Samish overlook. After a little break at the overlook, head back down to the earlier junction, and back to the Chuckanut trailhead. Overall a good hike. Not many grand views from the trails, but ok from the Oyster dome and Samish overlook. Today the cloud deck was bad, so I didn't see any water....just peaks sticking out from nearby mountains. Neat in itself. I'd say this is a moderate plus rating. ps. There were plenty of trail runners (students) and mountain bikers along Maxs shortcut and Larry reed trail.. So expect company.

Mount Ellinor	GoatPackin	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Getting an early start on this trail made all the difference in the world. My 9 yr old son and I got to the trailhead at 6:45 in the morning making parking easy with only four other cars in the lot. It took us two hours to reach the summit of Ellinor, we only encountered a couple other hikers during the climb so we pretty much had the trail to ourselves. The views are amazing some of the best I’ve seen, with clear skies we could see several different peaks including Mount Rainier. Our hike down took just over an hour, we had to step off trail several times while runners from the “Beast of Big Creek Trail Race” passed us on their way up and back down. It was impressive watching those men and women run that trail.  Back at the trailhead the parking lot was overflowing with cars, and someone from the Forest Service was checking for passes.

Cape Alava Loop (Ozette Triangle)	smcny911	Obstacles on trail:	    Trees down across trail,	    Muddy or wet trail.	Road suitable for all vehicles	Boardwalks were great and clear, but slippery. Beware of large trees / driftwood on the beach part of the hike. Started Ozette to Sand Point. Camped overnight, then took beach to Alava and back to Ozette the following day. It was great, we would do it again.

Hoh – High Divide Traverse: Hoh River, Hoh Lake, High Divide, Sol Duc River, Appleton Pass, Boulder Lake, Happy Lake Ridge, Aurora Ridge, Aurora Divide, Barnes Creek	Matt U	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were terrible	Snow free	This trail is a terrific sample of what Olympic National Park has to offer - including rain forests, massive trees, wild rivers, alpine meadows, and glacier views. A bonus is that big portions of it are very lightly traveled. We did this as a 3-day backpack, inspired by   which labeled the route as the Hoh-High Divide Traverse. The three days were 9.1, 15.4, and 19.5 miles respectively. For trailhead logistics, we parked a car at Storm King Ranger Station and used   to shuttle us to the Hoh Rain Forest Visitor Center. The first night, we camped at the Olympus Ranger Station (also known as Olympus Guard Station); the second night was at Appleton Pass. Two attractive features of these sites are that (a) they have bear wires, so no need to carry a bear canister and (b) they are outside of the Seven Lakes Basin quota area, so no reservations needed. You still do need a wilderness permit, but these can be obtained by self-registration at the trailhead or from the ranger at the Hoh Visitor Center. This means no need to stop by the Wilderness Information Center in Port Angeles. A   is available on the Olympic National Park site.

Rattlesnake Ledge	iEatRockz	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	This is a nice short and easy hike. Views at the top are incredible and the large flat rock areas are great to sit at and each some lunch.  I recommend going early on a weekday. I’ve done that before and saw around a dozen people on the trail. This time it was a Saturday. It felt like half of the city was fighting for trail space. I attached a photo that shows only a partial amount of the people at the top.	Aug 04, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-11.8648831503
Coyote Wall - Moab/Maui Loop 	EvilWalrus	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Hiked this trail around 8:30am on a Saturday morning.  Didn't encounter other hikers until 45 minutes or so into our trip.  We took several breaks to admire the views.  We made it up to Coyote wall, but unfortunately we were on a tight schedule and had to head back down before completing the hike.  It was a pleasant way to kick off our weekend adventures.

Stegosaurus Butte	JimK	Minor obstacles posing few problems	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Stegosaurus Butte, less known as Choirboy, is a short but steep hike near the Middle Fork Snoqualmie Trailhead. Roughly 2 miles roundtrip, 1100' gain. The drive up the Middle Fork Snoqualmie is pleasant now that it’s paved.  Takes about 20 minutes from I-90 to the large Middle Fork Trailhead parking lot.  I was surprised how empty the parking lot was on a Saturday--maybe because the Middle Fork trail is still closed (due to a slide), or maybe because everyone was parked up the road at a lot just before the Taylor River bridge (blocked).  There were plenty of campers at the Campground and further down at spots along the river. The easy access to the trail means some impromptu hikers. It's only a few minutes after crossing the Gateway Bridge that you come upon the worn trail heading up the hill to the left. The Butte trail is worn duff except for very steep places worn down to dirt.  Lower down you’re surrounded by ferns.  Halfway up it switches to salal, huckleberry, and other brush. The trail has only minor blowdown that's easy to step over. More difficult is the aggressive path up a steep slope; there are only token switchbacks. Coming down, poles are very useful. The first crest at 2000' is where many turn around. You have a good view of Mt. Garfield's sheer rock to the north. Across the 75’ wide butte are views up Rainy Creek toward Preacher Mountain to the south.  Dogs barking and hatchet chopping from the river campers can be heard. Although the trail is more overgrown heading to the top at 2120’, it is not difficult or unsafe.  From there you get a better view to the south but none of Garfield.  Rainy Creek is much louder here but unseen. On this day, the berries came out in force about 600' up.  I kept thinking about how much the bears (unlikely here) must like this.  Plenty of huckleberries and blueberries.

Highline SeaTac Botanical Garden	karnage	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	This tiny botanical garden is tucked away just north of the airport.  We enjoyed the waterfall, all the flowers in bloom, the rose garden and the meditative zen pools and bridges. From the website:  The trails are gravel and have many intersections, so its easy to get around.  in the south east corner there is a community garden that was fun to wander as well.  Next door is a BMX park with plenty of bumpy dirt trails to extend your hike.  Tons of huge ripe blackberries in that section.

Mount David	Heleene Tambet	Obstacles on trail:	    Trees down across trail,	    Overgrown in places.	Road recommended for high clearance only	We ran up and down Mt David last Saturday, altogether 4h30min and very much worth the drive. The views were incredible. The road up to the trail head is a little out of it; you probably can't pass having low clearance. The trail itself was somewhat grown into bushes, I'm not 100% sure that I would have even found the trail at one point if it wasn't for my boyfriend. This is just the 2nd mile of the hike though, it clears up nicely later. The real end is all loose rocks and some snow patches - it's a little sketchy but the conditions are as good as it gets! No chance to get lost. And the views of Glacier Peak and all the surrounding ridges are so worth the hike.	Aug 04, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-07.5326045914
Hoh River Trail to Blue Glacier	Sarah	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	I left Edmonds after work on Friday night. I had to go through Port Angeles to pick up permit, which I thought I would regret due to 3 hour ferry wait warning; however, thankfully I had to wait less than 90 minutes. I slept in my car in a pull out off Hoh River Road before entering the park. Got to trailhead and started hiking ~8 am Saturday morning. There weren't many cars in parking lot. A sign at trailhead warned of bear and coyote sightings. A group of two started about the same time as me, so I stopped and let them go ahead so we wouldn't be by each other on the trail.  Past Happy Creek camp, I passed 2 rangers who were marking off a beehive, which they think a bear disturbed. They also had a paintball gun they were going to use in attempt to scare off coyote(s) that have been spotted in camps. Shortly after continuing my hike, I saw a coyote walk across the trail. I passed a handful of groups hiking out. I arrived at Elk Lake camp to find a loud talking group and another group. Elk Lake had lots of lily pads and other stuff growing on the water. I elected to not drink out of it and go back down trail to Martin Creek to get water. I setup camp at Martin Creek camp. Saturday night I was only one there and Sunday there was one other group camped there. There is a bear wire, but not a toilet, so there were a couple spots right by camps people went to bathroom and left their disgusting toilet paper. Pack it out or bury it!!! Sunday I day hiked up to Blue Glacier, both the lateral and terminal moraine. I spent a couple hours enjoying the view from the lateral moraine. Amazing! Overall trail is in good shape, except there are spots between Elk Lake and Glacier Meadows camp where over grown. It rained Saturday evening for ~30 minutes, so the bushes were all wet, as were my clothes from walking though those sections of trail. Shortly before Glacier Meadows camp you need to go down a steep hillside/washout where a wire ladder with wood rungs. 3 of the rungs were out or broken. I do NOT like heights and after I climbed down a few rungs, I considered turning around since the thought of having to climb to bottom and back up it worried me. Thankfully, I didn't puss out and kept going. A majority of the trail parallels the river/creek; however, there is not constant access to water unless you want to bush whack. A prior trip report mentioned setting up base camp at Lewis Meadows and day hiking to Glacier. This would be do-able, but a long day. Overall, bugs were not that bad. Flies were the most annoying and I saw some mosquitoes but didn't come home with dozens of bites like I did from my two prior trips to different locations.

Little Giant Pass	MoonFighter	Obstacles on trail:	    Trees down across trail,	    Overgrown in places.	Road rough but passable	Little Giant Pass to Spider Gap, two night trip.  : A couple of fires in the area, probably most significantly is the Cougar Creek Fire, resulting in a bit of haze most days. Views were still spectacular. Make sure to check current conditions ( ).  River was under knee deep - 10 am crossing. Trail up to the Little Giant Pass is in good condition. From the pass on, it is standard unmaintained trail conditions - overgrown and washed out in places - but easy to follow. Made camp on the way up towards High Pass.

Mount Adams South Climb	JAB7	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	No bugs	Trail snow-covered at times - gear and expertise recommended	Last 4 miles of the road are a bit rough. I was in a sedan based off previous comments and we had to go so slow to not hit rocks and bottom out. I recommend being in a car just a little higher off the ground. We parked at the trailhead at 10pm. The lot is pretty big and lots of people set up tents to sleep for the night. Bring ear plugs! Lots of cars & people moving around at all hours. We started on the trailhead at 630am. First few miles is trecking through the forest at easy slope. Then you start to climb up through rocks for a few more miles. Once the snow fields started we put on crampons which helped. At lunch counter we ran into a goat all by himself. After eating we made our way up to the false summit. At this point it started to get pretty steep and using the ice axe made the steps more stable. Also started the step rest method and helped with breathing. After the false summit having a flat section was very nice. 1 more climb up a snow field and we made it to the top. Took about 6.5hr. The clouds started to roll in so we didn’t stay long and started to head down. For glisscading we made diaper sleds which worked so well. Took an old yoga mat and made it into a diaper using duck tape. Then had a heavy duty black garbage bag made 2 holes for legs and put over top. We had the best setup out of everyone we saw. Bags made us slide better and the diaper prevented any bruising. We did use our ice axe to slow us down but most of them weren’t very steep. Just past lunch counter it started hailing hard. Then lighting started and was so close all the hikers layed on the ground until it was 5-6 miles away. We continued down in the hail/rain. The storm slowed down once we were back to the car. The garage bag made a nice cover during the storm. Recommend it for multiple uses. Took about 10 hours total. Drove back to Seattle which made for a long day. This was a really challenging hike due to the elevation but totally possible if you prepare. Will do again.	Aug 04, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-14.3165512735
Blue Lake	Hiking Mom	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	We hiked this trail with our four kids - age range 11 to 6. This was our second time hiking this trail. It's a great one for kids.  This time visibility was low due to the smoke from nearby wildfires. The trail had just been recently reopened. We weren't able to see much of the mountain views due to this, but the lake and hike were still lovely. The trail leading up the lake was in great condition, and the smaller trails around the lake had been recently roped off - which was an improvement from a few years ago when we last visited. 	Aug 04, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-13.9442738814

South Tiger Mountain Loop	Hal I	Obstacles on trail:	    Overgrown in places.	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	The trail is overgrown in about three spots with thorny vines. Suggest wearing pants and using hiking poles to hike through the patches. There is a trail closure to South Tiger Traverse Trail until Fall 2020 so we couldn't get to the summit. There is lots of logging in-progress but not sure the "roads" link to other trails. Only plus is a nice view going up to the ATT cell site when crossing the power lines.

The Enchantments	NW_Hiker	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Intermittent snow - not hard to cross	Did this thru hike of the enchantments with my wife and another friend. Nearly 20 miles and 12 hours this is not a hike for the faint of heart as its not only long but extremely steep and the trail in places is very rocky which slows your progress. The rewards are awesome though with views that will make you want to get a permit and spend more time. We parked a car at the Snow Lake trailhead and used our other car to park at the Stuart/Colchuck trailhead. We dropped out first vehicle at 5:35 am at Snow Lake Trailhead and the parking lot was already full and had to park on the road. At The Stuart trailhead we arrived at about 5:55 am and got one of the last spots in the lot. The trail to Colchuck isn't too steep and if you plan on thru hiking I suggest going this direction as the snow lake side is a long hard pull and it forces you to go down Aasgard Pass which is much more technically difficult than going up. Colchuck Lake itself is gorgeous and worth a trip by itself but we had higher aspirations and headed up aasgard pass which is 2,200 vertical feet in .75 miles which is more bouldering than hiking. Its not technical this time of year as the snow is all gone and cairns mark the route. It is, however, steep and if you are carrying a pack this can really slow you down. After you reach the top and the core of the Enchantments about 7 miles in, all the hard work you put in is rewarded for the next 3-4 miles as you pass many alpine lakes and streams. This hike, despite its difficulty, is very popular and you will know that you are not secluded. We were passed by probably 10-12 people who were running the whole trail, where possible. We saw probably close to 100 others along the way. After the 3-4 miles of awesomeness you start to descend down the snow lake side and the views, although good in places, don't quite match those of the core of the Enchantments. The trail just keeps going, down, down and down and its unevenness in places leads to sore knees and feet. Towards the end all I could think about was the car and the ice chest of cold beer waiting for me at the end. Totally worth it though. I did get a few bug bites but not bad, the goats which you are sure to see, are pretty used to human intervention and will not pay you much attention so close up pics are easy to obtain.   	Aug 04, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-10.1962051967
North Fork Sauk River	polytraveller	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	The tread of the North Fork Sauk trail is excellent and easy to follow the whole way. The several bridges on the trail are in excellent condition, and are wonderful examples of backcountry engineering. To the best of my knowledge, trail workers have been out here in the last few years to care for this trail, and it shows: rocky retaining walls holding up trail surfaces, no big boulders in the middle of the trail, and recent trims of vegetation in exposed areas and avalanche chutes all contribute to a fine tread. The hike in took us 7 hours and 2 minutes, and the trip out was 6 hours and 4 minutes. Water! Of course there was water in the valley of the North Fork Sauk, as you come across swollen streams every mile or so at least. There was lots of water at the top on the PCT between the intersection with North Fork Sauk and White Pass Camp. Plenty of melt streams still going strong. If you plan to camp at White Pass, note that there is no water at the camp itself, and you’ll need to backtrack a little to get a water source. Drink all your water while climbing those awful switchbacks, and fill up before you get to camp. Wildflowers were on the tail end of their bloom, with most of their gorgeous displays clustered around melt streams. I saw paintbrush in red/orange and also in white, elephant heads, alpine aster, western anemone, red columbines, and a big stand of ghost pipes down by the river. Lots of mushrooms too, I counted over 30 huge fruiting bodies of boletus and russela delica, and countless other small ones. Unfortunately there weren’t many ripe blueberries at the top. I think peak berry season is probably a week or two away at this point. Bummer! Bugs were present, and got to be pretty annoying at points. However, last trip I finally discovered the wonderful invention of a mosquito head net, and I was prepared when it got bad. Those things are incredible, I can’t believe I never used them until this trip. What a lifesaver. This weekend the weather was great overall, with temperatures in the low seventies and patchy cloud cover giving a reprieve from the high country sun. As evening came on, Glacier Peak helped generate thunderstorms, and we heard rolling thunder to the north all night long. There was no snow on the trail or at White Pass camps, though you could find small patches here and there, especially if you take the time to explore the area... Once at camp, I explored a bit and took a couple side trips while my partner refreshed herself with a nap. I tried to climb White Mountain for an in-your-face view of Glacier Peak, but the boot path was steeper than my tired legs wanted to commit to after the climb up to the PCT, and I turned around 300 feet up or so. Later that evening we hiked the PCT north to Red Pass, where we took in one of the most incredible sunsets we’d seen in awhile. We spread the cremated ashes of our first dog, a spry little black pup named Spacedog, who joined us on our first trip up to this place in 2015. It was a bittersweet moment, sad and beautiful at once. All in all, this was a wonderful weekend with perfect conditions.I want to get up there again with an ultralight and fast setup to tackle White Mountain and maybe the cinder cone down by Glacier. Oh well, there’s always next time! 	Aug 04, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-08.5454599311
Snowgrass Flat	hikingwithzoe	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	We arrived at the trail head at 9:30 am. It was packed. Little did we know that this trail is the most popular trail in Goat Rocks. The trail starts off relatively level until crossing Goat Creek. We climbed around for a bit and found a nice waterfall just downstream from the bridge. We continued through the marsh, which was mostly dried up. The climbing started shortly after the marsh and the flies arrived, which weren't too bad as long as we moved. We arrived at Snowgrass Flats and were greeted by meadows of wild flowers. We had lunch at a creek and after exploring the area for a while, we turned back. About 3 miles from the trail head we heard thunder. It started to rain, a warm summer rain on a hot day turned into a downpour and hail. We arrived at the car, completely trenched, but safe. Regardless, we had a fantastic day.

Trap Lake	Nerup	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Early start (hit the trail at about 7 am). A good number of cars at the parking lot, mostly overnight stay's it would seem, but the trail was not crowded (only meet about 10+ hikers). Trail up to Hope Lake is steep, but with a dog its easy to find a good pace. From Hope Lake to Trap Lake you get a good mix of trees, open field and great views of the surrounding mountains so bring a good camera to capture nature. Good hard trail for people with good legs. I will most certainly will be back.	Aug 04, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-08.2562657306
Lake Valhalla	Kayla Heffner	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were terrible	Snow free	It was a cooler day in Seattle and so we set off for our hike in the morning with some clouds. Luckily the clouds broke near the pass and we had sun for most of our hike.  The turn off for the FS 6700 may seem a bit confusing but you literally cross straight over the West bound traffic and then you are on the road. The road was in good condition, it wasn't until the very last part before the parking lot that there were some rougher conditions but we took it slow and were able to manage in my little Subaru.  On the hike we had our 20lb dog, and 2 kids ages 12 and 9. We saw a group of backpackers with younger kids though about 3 years old I would say so that was reassuring.  The hike starts out at a good clip, you gain about all the vertical in about the first mile, mile-and-a-half. Since my husband and I just did the hike up to Camp Muir a few weeks prior - this felt like a piece of cake, didn't even really need water. The kids did good on this section too.  Once you are through that section it is smooth sailing from there with just some minor inclines to the lake. Mount McClausand comes into few in the last .25 miles before you head down to the lake area enjoy the view up top before heading down.  There is a toilet at the lake, over one of the hinges is broken so you will have to hold up the lid while you do your business.  We had an easy time finding a nice spot for our lunch around the lake and while there were quite a few people and dogs around it was still pleasant and spacious. The lake has a nice sandy area that you can walk into as well. Wish I brought my sandals and swimsuit up!  We stayed at the lake for about an hour before heading back down. I will say that the bugs were AWFUL. Even with bug spray we all still got bit. I counted about 15 bug bites the next day...they were very aggressive and you had to keep moving other wise they would have a feast.  Our timing was about 1.5 hours up, and 1 hour down. 	Aug 04, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-08.5331233902
Melakwa Lake	K.vu246	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Trail starts off at the Denny Creek trailhead. Paved roads up until the near the trail head where its smooth gravel. Crowded as expected, even at almost 1pm. The hike to Denny Creek and then Melakwa Falls isn't anything too strenuous, but it does increase in difficulty the closer you get to the Falls. Once passed the Falls, the remaining distance doesn't seem like much but the elevation gain is. It's a moderate incline until the last ~1.5mi where you gain something like 1000ft; it's a tough 1.5mi. The trail peaks and then drops 200ft to when you finally reach Melakwa lake.  The lake is beautiful and perfect for swimming in, surprisingly not as cold as Denny Creek down below. GPS told me the entire hike took 4 hours 48 minutes (moving time) over 10.85mi and 2,594ft gained at a pretty solid clip. We did make a small detour for Melakwa falls and walk around Melakwa Lake, but that wouldn't have been more than 0.6mi added so the total 8.5mi distance may be wrong. Difficulty is hard, and I would put it up there with Blanca lake in terms of intensity. Bugs weren't too bad, but DEET helped keep some of them at bay. Came home with several mosquito bites still. 	Aug 04, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-08.3221506006
West Fork Foss River and Lakes	fyodorova	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were terrible	Snow free	Beautiful views but my god, the bugs. This is my 10th year of hiking in Washington and I have never seen bugs half this bad. They relentlessly swarmed us whenever we stopped moving from Big Heart onwards. Mosquitoes don't usually swarm me, but I came home covered with bites. 100% DEET helped by creating a 2-inch radius between me and the bugs for an hour or two until it sweated off and the bugs landed again. A WTA work party was at work on the trail on our way up. Big thanks for keeping this trail in great shape! Other than the bugs, it was a good trip. We backpacked to Big Heart Lake several years ago and I always wanted to come back and follow the boot path that leads up the ridge between Big Heart and Angeline. The boot path is pretty well ground in although it does require route finding and a few scramble moves in places where the path seems to disappear over a steep section or up a boulder. There's a lot of up and down - my Gaia GPS registered 4700 feet gain on our hike in, and we felt it. Also, there is no water on the ridge until you get to the low point on the far side from the Big Heart camp area. There were a couple patches of snow at the far side but they were easy to get around. We camped near the rocky tarn at the end of the rib a few hundred feet above Chetwoot Lake. We were the only people in the area. Sunset views were magnificent from the slope above our camp. The next morning, we followed the boot trail downhill to Chetwoot. We had grand plans of exploring all the way to Iron Cap Lake, but that didn't happen because of the heat, bugs, and blister issues with new boots. There were barely any people camped at Big Heart. When we were last here in 2012 or 2013, there were hordes of people, campfires galore, and barely space for us to pitch a tent. This time, there were a lot of cars in the lot but I don't know where all the people were. 	Aug 04, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-08.0978956385
Dock Butte	peakjunkie	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Let's hear it for #watrailsday! Hadn't done this hike before, and it was a gem! Biggest issue with the road is the potholes. We had a Forester and didn't have issues other than bouncing around a lot, but if you have a low-clearance car you will need to pick your path very carefully. The worst sections are in the first few miles, after that it actually gets better. If you are used to manicured trails you might find this one a little rough. A lot of rocky and rooty sections, especially on the lower part. Regarding the choice point at 2.0 miles, my wife wanted nothing to do with the left fork that goes straight up the spine of the ridge. We took the switchback route, but even there she called it quits just before the summit, where there is a short section that requires a rock scramble. That being said, this hike has a very high payoff-for-effort ratio. You get fabulous view pretty quickly and keep them for the rest of the way. It also doesn't get the crowds you would have for a hike like Heliotrope Ridge, which has comparable gain. We hit the lake on the way back down. There appear to be two trails as you approach the lake, one going left, one going right. We took the right fork and made it to the lake, but it became clear pretty quickly that the left fork is the "real" trail, and takes you to a little promontory that juts into the lake. Would recommend going that way instead.	Aug 04, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-07.9858520955
Gothic Basin	ScottiBlub	Obstacles on trail:	    Trees down across trail,	    Difficult stream crossing(s).	Road suitable for all vehicles	We got to the trailhead at about 10am on Saturday morning. Lots of people on the trail all the way up, a few coming down from staying the night. There were 2 trees fallen across the trail, nothing too difficult to get through just to be aware of. We got to our site around 1pm and took a trip up to Foggy Lake. There was some snow patches but seems to be melting quickly. Lots of bugs in the evening, especially around twilight, and they left us with some bites!  Coming down Sunday morning there were lots of day hikers on their way up. Be sure to take your time on the rock scrambles, and be careful when passing others.  BEAUTIFUL hike. Loved every second of being in the Basin. Way larger than expected. 	Aug 04, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-07.0855164977
Surprise and Glacier Lakes	pjcamper	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	Beautiful, but difficult for my first backpacking trip. I just did an overnight but think if I stayed another night to rest I would have been ok. Lots of friendly people on the trail. Bugs were the only detractor from the beautiful scenery. I would suggest a hammock instead of a tent due to the rocky and uneven landscape though there are a few nice flat areas past the “day use only” area.

Green Mountain	JoshuaPNW	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were terrible	Snow free	Road was horrendous.  Full of potholes.  Not too busy in the parking area.  First 1/3 of the trail in the woods was pleasant, even with our 75lb overnight packs.  After getting into the meadow, the views were incredible and the flowers and butterflies were aesthetically pleasing, but the humidity and the biting flies sucked nearly all the joy out of the majority of the hike.   From the time we exited the tree line, to the time we set up camp at the base of the trail that leads up to the lookout, the flies and mosquitoes were unrelenting.  Overall, the hike was gorgeous and enjoyable.  We stayed overnight and got to see the mountain in all different lights and weather, which was awesome.  Even got to experience a mini lightning and thunder storm. The only things keeping me from wanting to do this hike again are the roads and the bugs.  Everything else was great.

Burnt Mountain	TheBeckWild	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	This was a wonderful short day hike offering incredible views and many wildflowers! The road was fine for our sedan and on the way down we even saw a group of motorcycles carefully making their way up. The trail was in good condition and easy to navigate. While there are great views from many spots along the trail, it is worth it to go all the way out and up to the summit of Burnt Mountain for an unobstructed 360 view!

Killen Creek to High Camp	OlyGirl	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	Trail head parking was full when we arrived at 9:30 Saturday morning. The trail to Killen Creek is dry and dusty, but definitely beautiful, and well maintained. The wildflowers are still in bloom, and the paintbrush are especially pretty right now. The bugs are no joke. I only rated them as an annoyance because they weren't as bad as the last time I was there. They did disappear after an intense afternoon thunder/hail storm, and then again before the sun came out in the morning. We ran into a few PCT thru hikers, and Tinker had time to sit and chat with us about his journey. If you're planning on coming to this area and you'd like to make someone's day, consider bringing a few extra snacks or energy bars to share with the thru-hiking folks. Trail Magic is so graciously received! 	Aug 04, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-06.7025589983
Artist Ridge - Huntoon Point	Christina Hickman	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Intermittent snow - not hard to cross	I'd only been to Artist Point once before this last trip and the weather wasn't the best-- we couldn't even see Mt Baker-- so this trip up was definitely a treat. No snow on the (long winding) road but evidence of it in the form of tall piles still exist. Parking lot was also clear but quite full for 4pm. We had already hiked earlier in the day so we just decided to do this short trail. I use the trail loosely because there's still snow ibscuring where the trail should be. It's not hard to navigate over or around but it definitely makes you scratch your head about where the trail should be. Try to stay off anything that looks like a meadow/stay on anything that looks like it is an actual trail. This is a tourist mecca, which means you will encounter all levels of preparedness. Sandals aren't the best choice with the snow, but you could probably do it in them fairly easily once its melted. There's a lot of dirt and rock on the trail, and the trail does gain some elevation which is slightly misleading as it says its ADA accessible. It's not, at least not the whole of it. The views for the work you put in are great. Shuksan is right in your face and Baker is close, but not in your face close. The rock formations in the entire area are just gorgeous and varying and there's so much to look at everywhere. We only spent probably 30 minutes doing the hike and taking photos before heading back to the car and down to the Heather Meadows picnic area for dinner. 	Aug 04, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-06.5552342251
Dewey Lake	Tiffany Venters	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were terrible	Snow free	My husband, our two little girls (7 & 9) and I entered and exited from the upper Naches Peak Loop Trailhead, and hiked the Dewey Lake Trail down to Dewy Lake for an overnight trip. The parking lots were full by 10:30 am so we parked in "over-flow" parking (the shoulder of the road). Most of the hikers we encountered were there for the Naches Peak Loop, and there was much less traffic once we headed down the Dewey Lake Trail.  We barely glimpsed Mount Rainier entering and exiting from the upper Naches Peak Loop Trailhead, but the sweeping alpine views more than made up for it. The trails were well maintained, the wilderness was litter free and all campers staying at the lake respected the fire warnings. Though I'm not sure mother nature got the "no fires" memo as the lightning and thunderstorm that rolled in Saturday afternoon was amazing. We didn't witness much wildlife, only Gray Jays, fish, crawdads and BUGS! Do not forget your 100% Deet or equivalent or it may end up spoiling your trip. The bugs were pretty bad, but they gotta eat too and it IS their home were visiting. The pristine calmness of the lake was more than enough to endure those pesty bugs. All in all, it was a great trip. A moderately-graded section on the trail down to the lake could prove tough for those with bad knees, but my two little girls made it just fine with their 15-20 pound packs.

Pete's Creek - Colonel Bob Peak	JR	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	First time here .One toad sign missing not a problem following directions on WTA site . Find trail across road from parking .Trail dropping from parking to creek is wrong trail . Starts moderately uphill and varies between steep and flat most of the way to the junction, then gets more serious for a while .Trail easy to follow although the encroaching vegetation will hide it a bit .Nothing scratchy so shorts were good, although wet from dew. The summit block does appear suddenly as has been stated. Easy scramble path along the left edge of the rocks, or just go straight up. 60 seconds up and you forget the past couple hours .Great views all around.  Very little snow left other than the Bailey Range and Olympus .Flowers still good and blue and salmon berries along much of the trail. 1 hour to the junction, 90 minutes to the Flats and 2 hours 10 minutes to the summit.  3500 feet closer to God!

Big Creek	cms	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	What an outstanding way to spend my weekend - I hiked it clockwise on a Friday evening and was pleasantly surprised at how well maintained and lush the trail was: tons of bridges and well signed. I liked it so much I rose early the next morning to run it in the opposite direction (I was camped at the Big Creek). It was awesome! I was able to cross the creek at the confluence - beware that there are two offshoots of this main trail: the confluence trial, which does NOT cross the creek, and the confluence access trail, which DOES provide a bridge to cross. The water at the confluence was warmer than it probably will be at any other time of year and fun to wade across, though I wouldn't recommend it for just anyone. The water seemed a little low and I picked a shallow spot with less forcible current to wade across so it was totally doable. You'll love this short hike.

Tubal Cain Mine to Buckhorn Lake	marianon	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were terrible	Snow free	Not wanting to leave early in the morning, we decided to drive to the trailhead the night of August 4th. The road was easy to follow, even in the dark after losing phone GPS. We started the next morning at 9am following a team of friendly WTA trail volunteers.  The wonderful thing about this trail is its steady and gentle ascent. There were few steep places to climb which made it easy to enjoy the view around.  After a long stint in the forest, at the start of the switchbacks begins the start of open 360 viewing. The trail is well marked and easy to follow but in my opinion it was incredibly narrow. On this trail I discovered I still have pretty rough vertigo so it was difficult for me to pass the sandier parts of the trail that looked nearly sloped out.  We arrived about .7 miles short of Buckhorn Lake to camp at around 1:30pm after taking many breaks on the way there.  After setting up camp we went up to the ridge of Buckhorn Mountain which was about an hour and a half up going very very slowly.  If you are afraid of falling/ heights like I am, more than half of this hike will be testing for you as the switchbacks are long and spit you out into the wide open.  I am looking forward to returning again next year.

Alta Mountain	Mrs. Mouse Hiker	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were terrible	Snow free	First thing first: sadly, we've lost a monopod close to the beginning of the trail. If somebody found it, please, contact me through the comment section below. I appreciate your help very much! Thanks in advance! Now the hike report :) We started hiking at noon. Bad... bad decision. The weather was hot, the trail was pretty steep and had lots of open areas without shadow. I highly recommend to start hiking much earlier and to take a sunscreen. There're also lots of mosquitoes and flies along the hike. Usually, bugs don't bother me much, but now I really regret we didn't took bug repellent with us. RACHEL LAKE The trail to Rachel Lake is flat and easy first, but after 1 hour of hiking it starts to gain some elevation (closer to the lake - steeper the trail). The trail goes through the bushes and forest - nothing exciting before you reach the lake. Rachel Lake is beautiful, definitely worth some time to chill out and have some rest. ALTA MOUNTAIN If you feel like you can go two more miles up to catch great views, I highly recommend you to take the trail to Alta Mountain. It's very steep and, considering hot weather, is very difficult. Normally, we hike 2 mi/hour, but that 2 miles took us around 1.5 - 2 hours. Hiking poles are super helpful there. The trail description says that the hike might be difficult for people who are afraid of heights. Both my husband and me are afraid of heights; however, we felt pretty comfortable during the hike because the trail is in a very good condition and pretty wide. The views along the way are amazing! Even though the hike was very difficult for us, we are glad we hiked all the way to the summit :)  Before hiking the Alta Mountain, I suggest to carefully read the hike description and print it or to make a screenshot. There are a few inter-junctions during the hike, and the trail description is very accurate and helpful. Also the trail is a little muddy and slippery sometimes, but that shouldn't be a problem. SUMMERY: 1) Sunscreen, bug spray, hiking poles are highly recommended 2) If you are going to Alta Mountain, I highly recommend to print or make a screenshot with hike description 3) The trail from Rachel Lake to Alta Mountain is very steep	Aug 04, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-05.2602466740
The Enchantments	GreatOutdoors	Minor obstacles posing few problems	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Intermittent snow - not hard to cross	We hiked from the Stuart Lake TH to Snow Lakes TH.  It was a spectacular hike but our number varied a bit from the trail description.  We had ~20 miles with 5200+ feet of climbing and 6500+ feet of descent. We had multiple vehicles to get between the trailheads, but there are apparently several shuttle services, in the morning, if you need transportation help. The trail is rugged and slow going in many parts (but well worth it).  Don't assume you'll average your normal pace for this hike (we were probably ~30% slower than "normal"). The ascent of Aasgard Pass is steep but not too difficult to follow (there are a lot of minor variations, but when in doubt, head up).  There is a lot of loose rock, so be careful of your footing and stay alert to folks above and below you. In general, there is plenty of water along the route, but don't expect much shade (or stable footing) between Colchuck and Lake Viviane.  The tread is mostly more regular once you reach Upper Snow Lake (with the exception of a section between lower Snow and Nada Lake) with lots more opportunities to duck into the trees.

Klahhane Ridge	Roeboat	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	Great hike up from the ONP gate to Lake Angeles where we dropped our heavy packs and headed up to Klahhane Ridge.  The Lake itself is incredible, but the hike up to the ridge was sublime.  So much varied terrain, views back to Port Angeles and back down to our campsite by the lake...what a perfect day.  And then, to top out on the ridge with views over to Hurricane Ridge just iced the cake!  We didn't make it all the way to the visitor's center, but it was worth every step. Bugs at the lake were minimal, trail in good condition, lots of shade up through until the ridge, all snow completely gone from the trail.  Lots of pink indian paintbrush in bloom as well.  A real treat! #hikeathon	Aug 04, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-05.9060187603
Old Robe Canyon	Captain Kirk	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	This trip report will be short: horseflies.  I made the mistake of not putting any insect repellent on and one lovely horsefly found my arm and decided to make a meal out of it. I made the mistake of smacking it instead of flicking it -- instinctive response -- and ended up with a nice little bloody smear on my arm from the poor fly's full tummy. The bite had the usual immediate swelling and burning. I got two other horsefly bites and a couple little mosquito bites... So really, the mosquitoes didn't seem to be a problem there, but the horseflies are hungry. They're so hungry. Maybe consider applying your insect repellent before you go here... I mean it could have just been me, maybe I'm delicious, but either way, don't make my mistake. If it was just mosquitoes it'd be no big deal, but alas. Alas. After putting repellent on for the way up, I didn't have any problems with them, thankfully.  Also note: There was a lot of broken safety glass from differently tinted windows in the parking area here. Looks like a place that probably has frequent break-ins. I would avoid bringing anything valuable in your car, don't even just stow things in the trunk. Maybe that's me being overly cautious, but all the same... 	Aug 04, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-05.9815809510
Ira Spring Trail - Mason Lake	HeatherJasper	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	The tree cover provided comfortable shade on an otherwise hot day. Not far from the top you break out of the trees but the wildflowers and views more than make up for the lack of shade. The open ridge is very close to the top where you drop over the ridge to Mason Lake.  Since it was a Saturday, there were a lot of people on the trail and the parking lot was full all day with lots of cars parked along the road also. However, the lake is big enough we didn't have any trouble finding a secluded spot towards the far end of the lake for a swim and quiet lunch.  Mason lake in August is the perfect temperature for a swim on a hot day. It's nothing like the bone-aching cold of recent snowmelt. The crystal clear water also makes it a beautiful place for a swim.

Dalles Ridge	mmumford11	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Dalles Ridge is a short, gain all the elevation at once trail. the TH was hidden along NF-7222-1. I blindly trusted Google to get me there, it tried to take me 800feet past where everyone was parked. the roads to get there were fine in a truck, but I assume sedans with less clearance will want to go a little slower. got to trailhead around 2ish and got to the first fork for Noble Knob and George Lake and went right, towards Noble Knob. (I've submitted sepearte trip report for the rest of trip). trail is a bit narrow in spots as far as giving people and doggos room to pass each other. other than that, very easy to follow.

Wynoochee Lake	nesmila	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	Took the east side of the lake. The trail is in really good shape at least to 4 miles in. A few overgrown spots but lots of nice single track. I was the only one on the trail until I ran into 18 mountain bikers on the way back. They were pleasant teens. My total elevation gain was 940 for the out and back.  Unfortunately just before you come to a short stint on the road there’s used TP and human poop on the trail 😕	Aug 04, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-05.0875322623
Lake Valhalla	Megan123	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	Went out today. Started from Smithbrooke which is very easy trail head. Had a nice little parking lot by by 8am it was already full but there is road parking. Hike is a little hard for the first mile or so with a few switchbacks. After that it's easy. Saw only four people on the way there, two coming back and the remaining going to the lake. The 2 fallen trees on the trail are easy to climb over. Bugs were annoying but neither of us got bitten more than once. Saw lots of people on the way back. Beautiful hike!

Summit Lake	alinajam3s	Trail in good condition	Road recommended for high clearance only	Bugs were terrible	Snow free	This hike is not advisable if you don't have a high clearance vehicle because the road have A LOT of rocks and HUGE POTHOLES. My car is lowered and I was afraid to damage it so we decided to hike it up 6 miles away from the trail's parking lot. Being exhausted from a long hike was fine but being feast on by the horse flies were INSANELY ANNOYING. I got bit by the flies and it stung. The only best part of going there by foot was seeing every beautiful views of the lake down below, cascades, and the vast amounts of wildflowers.

Mount Pugh	degrave	Trail in good condition	Road rough but passable	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	What a wonderful hike!  Mt Pugh offers a great progression--you start in thick, dark forests, rise through alpine meadows, and end with a rewarding but easy scramble up beautiful diorite gneiss (I think). Most of the trail is very straightforward. Despite the apparent ~1000 ft elevation gain per mile, my two buddies and I thought the trail felt surprisingly mild.  The forested section is in very good condition, with a bed of cushy pine needles that your knees will be thankful for on the way down!  The rock/meadow section after the forest can be a little loose, so watch out for parties above in case they knock down some rocks. Along the ridgeline the trail becomes a little exposed, but there's no snow at this time, and the footing is secure. Eventually you come to a crux about 500 feet below the summit where you'll need to use your hands to scramble up a short section of rock.  We saw a few parties get sketched out here and turn back, but the scramble is quite easy with great holds, and the trail reappears again shortly. One of us had never scrambled before, and handled this without any issue. Bugs were occasionally annoying, but not too bad. Blueberries (or huckleberries? not sure) were ripe and delicious. We made the trip in ~7 hours including lunch at the summit and a number of breaks.  	Aug 04, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-05.5481623201

The dog and I spent a considerable amount of time sitting on the benches, just listening to the sound of the waterfalls. Arrived at the trailhead a 6am and was the only car in the parking lot. By the time we ended our line at 830 the parking lot was completely full. Do this hike early or during the week if you want some solitude.

Big Four Ice Caves	hikingwithlittledogs	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were not too bad	Snow free	DIdn’t have a lot of time for a hike today but I thought Lake 22 would be nice in the evening. At 5:30pm the lot still looked full with cars overflowing to the nearby picnic area. I decided to go with Plan B. Big Four was great. It amazes me how much it changes with each season. The place gets flattened under many feet of snow in the winter. In spring the skunk cabbage goes crazy and birds bring the place to life. In the summer it feels like the plants come back with a vengeance. Tall grass and reeds by the boardwalks. All kinds of bushes, ferns, flowers and berries growing like crazy until the next change of season.  Lots of families enjoying the trail. It’s short and easy and good for all kinds of hikers.  Please enjoy the caves from a distance. Going in or near the opening is risky because large chunks can break off without notice.  Happy hike-a-thon. Please consider making a donation. https://give.wta.org/fundraiser/1534920 PS.

Naches Peak Loop	Oregon Beaver	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	After reading previous reviews, we were prepared for bugs.  As Ivar M said, we didn't really encounter many pesky bugs either.  There were a few mosquitoes, but they didn't seem to be biting. This was my first time on this trail.  This is the time and weather to be on it.  The wildflowers are in bloom, the weather is good and the views are great.  We got to the parking lot around 9 a.m. and there was still enough parking for maybe a dozen cars.  By the time we finished the loop in the afternoon, the parking area was totally full and cars were parked along SR 410 almost to where the trail crosses the road.  When it is this crowded, it also means there is always a line for the 2 pit toilets.  The trail didn't feel too crowded, although there was a lot of traffic either direction.  Worth the trip.

Vesper Peak	wolfwoman	Minor obstacles posing few problems	Road recommended for high clearance only	Bugs were not too bad	Snowfields to cross - could be difficult	This was my 6th or 7th trip up Vesper, but was especially fun since I was joined by old friend J.T. and newish friend Doug. The road is indeed rough and certainly many folks would drive an average sedan to the trailhead, but not me. There's only a couple nasty spots, but they are the type that can cause some damage.  Besides, I like my car and don't like repair bills. Search and Rescue were present at the trailhead, on the trail and in the air looking for a lost hiker. Volunteers and true heroes. The trail is the same old rocky rooty grind, but the creek crossings are better than what I've experienced  here in the past when snow melt is raging. There's a spot on the trail that has almost completely washed out and I can't imagine it surviving another season without some work. Otherwise, even though the route to Headless Pass was a mess of erosion in places, it actually seemed easier in a way since deep gouges were there to hike up rather than the skimpy trail/ball bearing stuff I've usually encountered. Snow begins pretty much where the slabs start and the greenery ends. It's a bit steep in places, but was soft enough today although a little slippery. After a very long break at the summit slamming down lunch and views, we headed back. As is often the case, going up was easier than going down. We all dealt with it differently. Doug had his microspikes which he felt helped him a lot. I was pokey plunge stepping my way along. J.T. standing glissaded like a pro. As an old friend of mine used to say, Humble Bumble. I find this trail to be especially exhausting because there isn't really anywhere you can cruise. There's always roots, rocks, slabs, or snow to look out for. Still, it's so worth it even if it's your sixth or seventh time.	Aug 04, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-04.3496621514
Gothic Basin	Matvicswo	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	I selected “trail in good condition” because there was no snow (just a few patches on the way to Foggy Lake, which are easy to avoid) no tricky water crossings, no runoff on the trail, and no blowdowns to speak of.   That doesn’t mean it’s an easy trail - it’s not, but neither does it claim to be. Everything written in the description is accurate! And today was just on the comfortable side of hot to be climbing and clambering and slogging to the top.  I’m glad I only had a daypack! But it’s still very popular, and deservedly so because the views on the way are great and the ending is spectacular and other worldly. The bonus trip to Foggy Lake is well worth the comparatively small extra effort. Parking is easy enough on the road if the Barlow Pass lot is full. But you DO still need a NW Forest Pass it appears (lots of tickets issued today).	Aug 04, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-04.1312924019

We set out a little later than we had hoped, but still arrived at the trailhead around 11am. There were a ton of cars, so we parked along the road, but luckily not too far from the trailhead. The trail is in immaculate condition and was incredibly pleasant from start to finish. I didn't expect the elevation gain to feel so short; the switchbacks are out of the way quick. Once you're on the PCT, it's a very slow, gradual climb that's barely noticeable. The lake itself was basically a beach party! I wasn't expecting any solitude though, so this was fine. It didn't seem like there were as many people as there were cars at the trailhead either. Everybody was having a good time and being respectful. We had floaties and got in the lake with them, which was incredible. The bugs were only an issue by the time we were getting out of the lake, and the afternoon sun was getting toasty. I still made it out relatively unscathed despite wearing a crop top and no bug spray! 10/10, perfect hike!	Aug 04, 2018	https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2018-08-04.2041210268

Glacier Basin	Meagymuffin	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	Bugs were an annoyance	Snow free	Hit the trail this morning after spending the night in White River Campground.  It was a nice smooth trail that took us about 3.5 hours with a little exploring in the basin after the end of the trail. Nice views of the mountains along the way.  Pretty mellow elevation gain for the first 2.5 miles and then a little steeper grade uphill to reach the glacier basin camp. Lots of asters blooming with some lupines left and a spattering of paint brushes. It's certainly a beautiful area of the park.

Heybrook Lookout	Martin Ralya	Trail in good condition	Road suitable for all vehicles	No bugs	Snow free	Did this gorgeous little hike with my kiddo today, and what a fun short hike it was. The trail is nicely maintained, albeit steep enough to prompt some kiddo grumbles and a few more breaks than normal, but the view from near the top -- and then from the actual lookout -- is breathtaking. Seriously one of the best views I've had since moving here, and for the low, low price of a 2.6-miler. Arriving at 8:30 am on a Sunday, the gravel pull-out was 75% full. We saw probably 30 people altogether, and it took us 1:45 trailhead to trailhead at an unhurried pace, including a 20-minute break at the top of the tower. We saw lots of giant slugs, too!
