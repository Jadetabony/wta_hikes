Instead, try this ""backdoor"" approach via Lake Eleanor to enjoy this stunning destination. The hike begins just off FR 7360, following a bootpath along the edge of Eleanor Creek. The trail enters a mixed forest and begins a moderate climb toward Lake Eleanor. Within 0.5 mile, you will cross in to Mount Rainier National Park and in another mile arrive at the lakeside. There are a few campsites around Lake Eleanor that provide nice views of the lake and a pleasant place for a snack, though most hikers will be eager to push onto the meadowlands ahead. From the lake, the trail steepens and climbs through larger stands of hemlock and fir. The moderate climb is broken up by short wanderings through progressively larger meadows. Push onward and upward to the wide expanses of Grand Park. Often filled with wildflowers during the spring and summer months, the miles-long grassland can seem to be awash in color from the moment you arrive. Resist the temptation to linger at the edges and continue onto the meadow's high point for outstanding views of The Mountain. Find a comfortable spot to settle in and soak up the panorama. If you're hungry for more, you can continue all the way through Grand Park's meadows to connect with the Northern Loop Trail and Wonderland Trail."

Much of the forest on Blanchard is second-growth; logging artifacts can be seen on the trail, and giant stumps inspire imagination about the towering cathedral forests that blanketed the mountain prior to logging.Access to Oyster Dome is best from the Samish Overlook parking area on Blanchard Mountain. It's a bit of a rough road to get there, but the views from the beginning and end of the hike are well worth it.From the trailhead, head northwest on a section of the Pacific Northwest Trail, entering the second-growth forest of Blanchard Mountain. In 0.4 miles, descend 190 feet to the junction with the Samish Bay Connector and turn right. You ascend as the trail switchbacks steeply through second-growth alder, Western redcedar, and Douglas fir forest. Logging artifacts can be seen on the trail, and giant stumps inspire imagination what grew on Blanchard prior to logging. The elevation gain briefly becomes gentler as you cross several small creeks. This area receives substantial rainfall, and the Washington Conservation Corps has built turnpikes to reduce the numbers of waterspots and mudholes. After another one-half mile, the grade steepens, and switchbacks fortified by rock walls lift you past giant boulders. Here, formerly rooty and slippery sections have been bypassed or rehabilitated by WTA volunteers in 2014, 2015, and 2016. 1.9 miles from the Samish Overlook, you will come to a junction with the trail to Lily and Lizard Lakes.

A word of caution: be careful near the edge of the promontory, as the dropoff is unforgiving; keep children and pets away from the edge. NOTE: There is another way to access Oyster Dome, found along Chuckanut Drive (Highway 11). This access point includes more switchbacks and elevation gain, but lacks any facilities, and requires crossing a highway to get to the trailhead. If you choose to start here, park carefully.

But boy is the fishing good; that's what lures most visitors to these aquatic gems.Everything you've heard or read about this hike is true: it's a bear. Never officially constructed, this trail resembles little more than a way path, especially the second half. We're talking no-frills hiking here. Beginning at the end of the Hamma Hamma Road near a dramatic gorge and waterfall (did you peek over the bridge?), Mildred Lakes Trail no. 822 immediately enters the Mount Skokomish Wilderness.Winding through recovering wilderness (the area was logged decades ago), the first mile or so is easy enough. But once you cross a large avalanche chute, the misery begins. Around fallen logs, over fallen logs, and straight-up rocky and rooty slopes the trail climbs a 3200-foot ridge. Mount Pershing looms in the southeast.Through hemlock and huckleberry the trail hightails it off the ridge, dropping 250 feet into a cool forested glen graced by a rushing creek. Cross it on a questionable log (or wade), and within two minutes come to another creek crossing, this one much easier. Now the way gets tricky and even tougher. Ascending a steep ridge, upward mobility is temporarily halted upon coming to a ravine. Using roots as handholds, drop 25 feet into the dank draw before resuming the taxing climb. After clambering over rock, root, and ledge-and gaining 1000 feet in elevation-the insanity ends on a 4100-foot heather-draped ridge crest. Wander along the open ledge, enjoying excellent views of Mount Cruiser and the Sawtooth Range, but no lakes.Your punishment isn't actually over. Drop 200 feet through marshy mosquito breeding grounds before finally coming to the first lake (elev. 3800 ft).

Scramble over more root and rock to the far side of the lake for good fishing and resting posts. Share the abundant trout with the resident osprey.If not totally spent, consider checking out the other two lakes.

Seemingly everywhere, herds of mountain goats calmly wander by. Superlatives simply don’t suffice, and you quickly find yourself resorting to otherworldly comparisons, just like the early visitors who bestowed place names like Aasgard, Sprite and Leprechaun on the fairytale surroundings. There are three ways to experience the Enchantments, none easy. The absolute minimum price of admission here is a hike of not less than seven miles gaining at least 4,400 feet in elevation in order to make it to even just one of the lakes in the Upper Enchantments. If you're lucky enough to get an overnight permit, you can backpack at your leisure via the Snow Lakes or Stuart Lake trailheads. If you’re a very strong hiker, you can make it in and out via either trailhead in a single day, although seeing all of the lakes this way is so grueling it borders on the impossible. With two cars (or a car and some bikes), you can hike point-to-point from one trailhead to the other and transit between the two. The thru-hike is typically done from the Stuart Lake trailhead, because it reduces the total elevation gain by 2,600 feet relative to going the opposite direction (although it still takes in the punishing climb up Aasgard Pass, which rises 1,900 feet in less than a mile). Pick your poison; enjoy the rewards. This guide uses the thru-hike as a basis for describing the route through the entire Enchantments. Starting from the Stuart Lake trailhead, follow the route to Colchuck Lake as described here: http://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/colchuck-lake. From the end of the trail at the far end of the lake, cross boulders around the shore under the terminal moraine of the Colchuck Glacier (the trail may disappear at times, but cairns usually mark the way). After passing by a particularly tall boulder, the trail skirts a sandy beach and begins snaking through subalpine firs and creek beds. Soon after, the route begins climbing steeply over jumbled talus; this is the start of Aasgard Pass. The “trail” once again becomes difficult to follow (look for faint tread and cairns) as it slants upwards and to the left of a large and very visible larch grove approximately halfway up the climb. It’s not uncommon for hikers to follow the runoff stream to the right of the grove, but do not go this way. Stay to the left to avoid much steeper, impassable terrain. Around the grove, the route hugs the sheer rock opposite Dragontail Peak (the dark imposing pyramid that blocks out most of the sky to your right when looking uphill), before traveling through a section of loose rock and scree. Views are simply awesome throughout the ascent, stretching from nearby Colchuck Peak and the aquamarine of Colchuck Lake to Glacier Peak and Mount Baker in the distance. After crossing a branch of the creek, the route steepens again, becoming a hands-and-feet scramble through stunted larches. The final third of the climb is over large boulders, finally topping out at 7,800 feet. Depending on the age of your map, you’re standing in either Aasgard or Colchuck Pass, the beginning (or end, if going the opposite direction) of the Enchantments. These are the Upper Enchantments. The lakes in this section sit in a stark moonscape of rock, scree and ice below the long ridge culminating in the summit of Dragontail Peak, just above the pass. The trail snakes its way through grey lichen-covered rocks along the shores of Tranquil and Isolation Lakes before dropping steadily to the broad plateau beneath Little Annapurna (so named for its resemblance to the much taller Nepalese peak). Beneath Little Annapurna, the barren rock gives way to a lusher alpine meadow, where the creek connecting the lakes meanders gently before tipping into a deeper channel and speeding downhill. The first larches appear as the plateau ends abruptly in expansive views over Crystal Lake and the Ingalls Creek valley below. The trail now heads east and down a steep draw to Inspiration Lake. This azure pool tucked deep in a basin below Enchantment Peak marks the beginning of the Middle Enchantments. Inspiration is perhaps the most dramatic of the lakes, with granite rising steeply on three sides and a stand of larches on the opposite shore. The trail proceeds through these larches before dropping a short distance down to Perfection Lake.  “Perfection” is no idle exaggeration. As you descend to the shore, you pass through tall larches whose ages are most likely measured in multiple centuries. The top of the lake is shallow and perfectly clear. The trail passes through gentle meadows of grass and heather and over carved inlets leading from Prusik Pass (a side trail runs up to this saddle below Prusik Peak, yielding even more jaw-dropping views) and continues along the eastern shore. The view back across the water reveals a stair-step wall of granite over which the main creek cascades down to the lake. A short while later, the trail climbs slightly and rounds the corner to Sprite Lake, connected to Perfection by a narrow slot of white water. The view back upstream, of Little Annapurna towering above a small island in Perfection Lake, is one of the best in the Enchantments. Further down the trail, a descent along the fast-flowing creek ushers you out of the Middle Enchantments. The Lower Enchantments are marked by the heights of McClellan Peak on one side and Prusik Peak on the other. Under McClellan’s lofty summit sits Leprechaun Lake, an irregular pond draped between ribs of granite topped by dense stands of larches. One rib forms a peninsula that nearly bisects the lake. Travel over narrow rock ledges along Leprechaun’s shore before heading over open terrain and then climbing above steep slopes on its twisting way down to Lake Viviane, the last (or first) of the lakes. Viviane rivals Inspiration for the drama of its setting. It sits in a deep basin below the long, graceful fingers of upturned granite that make up Prusik Peak. Viviane’s far shore is a wall of rock; its near shore, a smoothed wave of granite where glaciers once exited these heights and where Snow Creek now streams out of Viviane down to Snow Lakes. Whether this is your introduction to the Enchantments or your parting glance, the views in every direction from this rocky shelf are an equally fitting greeting or sendoff. Crossing the outlet on a bridge of weathered driftwood, you begin the descent to the Snow Lakes trail. The stretch between Lake Viviane and the mouth of Upper Snow Lake is rugged at times (including some scramble sections) and breathtakingly beautiful. Snow Creek twists and roars between stands of subalpine firs (the larches end a few hundred feet below the lake). Until you reach the dark forest along the shore of Upper Snow Lake, you’ll still feel as if you’re wandering not through wilderness, but a garden landscaped by some unseen hand. You now follow the Snow Lakes trail (described here: http://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/snow-lakes) back to its start on Icicle Creek Road. Be prepared that the descent from Snow Lakes to the trailhead can be even more painful than the climb up Aasgard Pass--the repeated percussion of walking steeply downhill while losing more than a mile of elevation takes its toll. Long before you reach the parking lot, you will be shuffling listlessly, every step a small victory of mind over matter. However, the alternative--proceeding from the Snow Lakes trailhead to the Stuart Lake trailhead--gains 7,000 feet in elevation, softening you up before the descent of Aasgard Pass, which is only slightly less punishing to the feet and even more demanding of your quads and knees. All who come here would agree: the pain is a small, small price to pay. Your mind will quickly forget the trials of the way out (or in), but will be forever filled with visions of what can only be described--in a final fit of hyperbole--as heaven on earth.WTA Pro Tip #1: The goats that live in the Enchantments have become accustomed to finding salt in the urine of hikers. This causes them to follow their human guests a little too closely, which is as unsettling as disappointing (a mountain goat trying to drink your urine loses a bit of its wise, dignified mien). To help prevent this too-intimate interaction, always use the privies provided, which keep waste completely out of reach of prying snouts. The Forest Service has posted a video guide to hiking safely with goats here: http://youtu.be/E1STqskP4VE. WTA Pro Tip #2: Camping in the Enchantments, including the entire area from the top of the switchbacks above the Snow Lakes trailhead all the way to the Stuart Lake trailhead, is by permit only from May 15th-October 31st. Permits are awarded by the Forest Service through a lottery that opens in February. A limited number of permits are available same day at the ranger station in Leavenworth. WTA Pro Tip #3: Dogs and campfires are strictly prohibited in the Enchantments. Dogs were disallowed in order to enable the recovery of ptarmigan populations they once disturbed. Fires are restricted not only to prevent forest fires, but to avoid scavenging of dead wood. Decomposition of the wood provides scarce organic material to soils in alpine areas like the Enchantments. The restriction includes camp stoves (such as the BioLite) that burn small twigs."

The narrow isthmus between the lakes offers a majestic view across the water to the towering heights of McClellan Peak. Camping at Snow Lakes or nearby Nada Lake used to be the strategy of backpackers who missed out on the Enchantment Lakes lottery but still wanted to get within easy day-hiking range of the permit zone. However, the permit zone has since been extended to include nearly the entire Snow Lakes trail from the top of the first set of switchbacks all the way around the far shore of the upper lake. As in the core Enchantment Zone, overnight stays within this area are allowed by special-issue permit only from  May 15th -October 31st. From its beginning just off of Icicle Creek Road, the trail immediately drops a short ways to a wide bridge over the creek and then begins climbing, gaining 800 feet in a set of lengthy switchbacks over its first mile. The grade levels off somewhat for the next mile and a half as you head straight back into the Snow Creek drainage, passing through terrain still bearing the sooty scars of a forest fire long ago. This early stretch of trail sees quite a bit of traffic from rock climbers making their way to Snow Creek Wall, the vertical face of granite visible on the far side of Snow Creek. You soon enter forest and skirt the edges of the creek before the climbing begins in earnest again. Another set of switchbacks takes you through an area of trees snapped off impressively by slides and wind – you’ll pass several trees that bear sobering gashes from crashing boulders. After crossing a log bridge over Snow Creek, things once again level out, climbing slowly, but steadily until a steeper section over talus slopes takes you to Nada Lake under increasingly striking granite peaks. It is not uncommon to see mountain goats as you make your way around the lake over a flat half mile and beyond. Here, the trail once again steepens as it passes through another rock field. Fortunately, the remaining distance has greatly shrunk by this point, and before you know it, you are at Snow Lakes. The trail leads across a masonry spillway at the midpoint between the two lakes which, rugged and beautiful though they may be, are manmade. They are part of the Icicle Irrigation District, as is Colchuck Lake on the far side of the Enchantments. The water is drawn down in late summer not only to help farmers in the valleys below, but also to send much needed cold water to rearing salmon at the Leavenworth National Fish Hatchery. Hike through at the right time, and you may witness a huge plume of water shooting out over the rocks above Nada Lake from a massive tunnel bored to Snow Lake straight through the rock. Depending on the season, the spillway may be dry or may be underwater. When the water is ankle high, hikers often remove their boots and socks and walk across barefoot to a small peninsula that juts out into the water, providing views up and down the lake. In one direction is an impressive collection of bleached snags that have drifted down the lake and mounded up in impossibly large numbers. The upper end of the lake soars. Over the far shore, smooth slabs of granite curve gracefully towards the water’s edge while McClellan Peak towers above. The trail continues from here around the lake and up into the Enchantments, but for day-hikers, this is the perfect spot to take in the views and turn around. WTA Pro Tip #1: The hardest part of the Snow Lakes Trail is not the climb in, but the journey out. On the return to the trailhead, the trail sheds 3,600 feet of elevation over a rocky, uneven 5.3 miles between the outlet of Nada Lake and the bridge to the parking lot. Though seemingly not that steep, the uncommonly long downhill produces a constant jarring and pounding that reduces even hardened mountaineers to a pained shuffle by the time the parking lot comes into view – unfortunately, with 24 switchbacks still left to go. Leave yourself time to take breaks – no matter how used you are to long hikes, your feet will thank you. WTA Pro Tip #2: For those camping, there are numerous spots around both Nada and Snow Lakes and along the trail. Pay attention to posted signs, though, as there are many places that are marked off-limits, such as those for day use only and those closed for restoration. There are lots of excellent spots tucked in the trees around Lower Snow Lake – a sign points off the main trail just before the spillway. There are also a few scattered sites along the early portion of the trail, at 2.5, 3.3, and 4.75 miles from the trailhead. The last one is situated just before a sign prohibiting campfires beyond that point. However, the scarred landscape below argues for relying on a camp stove even here. Remember that camping is by permit only at all of these sites from May 15th-October 31st. WTA Pro Tip #3: In late summer, pack insect repellant. By July, the Snow Lakes are home to a large and particularly voracious population of mosquitoes, especially in the dark, cool forest along its southeastern shore."

Washington’s Cascade Range is one long string of volcanoes. This includes 12,276-foot Mount Adams. Adams initially formed about 1 million years ago, but its present eruptive cone is closer to 10,000 to 25,000 years old. Since then, Adams has erupted at least seven times. The most recent eruptions have been along the mountain’s lower slopes, in the form of broad lava flows.Lava beds are formed when slowly cooling magma flows across large areas. While the Aiken Lava Bed is Mount Adams’ best-known flow, the Muddy Fork Lava Bed is the most recent. This basalt bed settled on the volcano’s northeastern flank roughly 3,000 years ago. Despite the lava beds’ rough and desolate terrain, the hike to get there is comfortable. From the trailhead, take the Pacific Crest Trail as it slopes down toward Muddy Fork Creek. The gentle descent leads through spacious forest, allowing the sun to stream through the canopy. Approximately 2 miles into your relaxing stroll, you’ll get your first up-close view of the lava bed. As the lava cooled, it suddenly stopped and left the 20-foot abrasive and desolate black wall that stands in front of you. The trail continues around the high basalt wall for the next half-mile or so. Continue wandering along the base of the flow, or scramble up to explore its surface.Dormant Volcano: Recent hot spots and gas emissions on Mount Adams’ summit show that the volcano is dormant but not extinct. This means that Mount Adams will someday show more signs of its volcanic nature."

Begin from the Johnston Ridge Visitors Center. Take in the mountain from this angle, which offers a direct line of sight across the plains and into the blast zone. Is the dome smoking today? Check again as you hike – conditions in the crater change from hour to hour. Follow a paved pathway that leads up several tight switchbacks to an overlook of the mountain. From here you can also see down the valley, where the silvery thread of the Toutle River winds away out of sight. A metal map here offers excellent insight into the surrounding peaks and other landmarks. It’s worth taking some time with it to orient yourself and learn what you’re looking at. When you’ve examined the landscape and learned a few of the peaks, proceed along the paved path, continuing downhill and to the west. The trail follows a ridgeline here and the mountain is nearly always visible, but occasionally disappears from view as you round a hummock.A mile and a half from the parking lot, arrive at a junction. The trail to the right is what you want – it leads you across the base of a steep, cliffy hill. This section may pose trouble to those with a fear of heights. Stick close to the inside of the trail, avoid the outer edge and the traverse should be just fine. Upon successfully crossing this section, a new expanse of prairie comes into view. Take a moment at this vantage point and look for Mount Adams on the northern horizon. Continue through rolling, dusty hills and hummocks, occasionally losing sight of the mountain but never lacking for visual stimulation. The area is fascinating and full of life, though it looks barren at first glance. At three miles, leave this section and enter a surprisingly lush area. Huckleberry bushes abound here at the transition between deserty blast zone and green, lush hillside. Shortly arrive at a junction at about 3.5 miles. The trail heading straight on is the Boundary Trail, one that heads into the Mount Margaret wilderness. Harry’s Ridge is to your right, up a ridge that offers views of Spirit Lake and Mount Adams. Take in the sapphire-blue lake below and the enormous log raft. These are downed trees from the 1980 eruption that have slowly been pushed by snow or other natural forces into the lake. Winds in this area push the raft around, so it may change shape during your visit. Almost there. Continue up the ridge to an outcropping of cement and metal, remains of an old weather station and observatory. This is the high point of the hike, and though the trail itself continues downhill, make it your stopping point for lunch, where you can gaze at the white cap of Mount Adams and the smoking lava dome of St. Helens simutaneously. On the way back down, be sure to check the shape of the log raft in Spirit Lake before heading towards the Visitors Center."

A narrow canyon east of Granite Falls proved to be a particularly challenging spot to lay tracks; frequent floods and rock slides destroyed not only the tracks, but also the settlement of Robe. The repair costs were high, and the line was eventually abandoned. Fortunately, today’s hikers can still enjoy the area thanks to a Boy Scout troop, who built the trail in the 1960s, and the Snohomish County Parks Department, who created the Robe Canyon Historic Park in the 1990s.The well-maintained trail quickly leaves the Mountain Loop Highway behind as it descends 300 feet down a steep bluff toward the Stillaguamish River. A series of gentle switchbacks makes the trip down (and back up) easy on the knees. The river bottom is wide and lush with maples and cottonwoods, making this an ideal place to soak your feet while soaking up the sun.Paralleling the river, the trail begins to show signs of the flooding that made this stretch so problematic for workers more than a century ago; undercut banks and eroded trail are prevalent, but easily manageable for hikers today. The roar of the river soon rises as the water is funneled through narrowing canyon walls, creating frothy rapids and churning eddies. Here, too, is the first tangible evidence that a railroad once ran this way. Walking atop the old railroad ties, it is easy to imagine the mining days of yore and to conjure up images of rusty railroad cars chock-full of ore rolling down the bumpy tracks.At 1.2 miles, a rockslide blocks the path, marking the official end of the trail, and once again confirming the difficulties that railroad engineers faced so long ago. Beyond the rockslide, the trail leads to several tunnels, but for now it is not safe to venture that far."

A hike on the trail can be combined with a hike on the Bellefields Loop Trail, a trip to the Winters House or a stop at the Blueberry Farm for some blueberry picking. Start the Heritage Loop Trail at the Winters House (open Tuesdays, Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays from 10:00 AM – 2:00 PM) to grab a trail map, take a tour of the historical house, and learn about the early settlers in the Park. Exiting the Winters House, cross the parking lot to the obvious gravel trail and head south towards the Blueberry Farm. Turn left at a yellow fire hydrant, continuing down a dirt path to pick up the Heritage Loop Trail in a counterclockwise direction. Follow the wide, well-groomed path for about 0.2 miles, emerging at the Blueberry Farm. Continue past the Farm onto the obvious gravel trail marked by three wooden posts.The gravel trail soon becomes a wooden boardwalk, and in about 0.2 miles you will reach an intersection signed “Lake to Lake Trail”. Turn left towards the Bellefields Loop Trail and continue winding your way along the boardwalk. Enjoy the lush vegetation, berries and pinkish lavender colors of the Hardhack springing up on either side of the boardwalk.  In about 0.1 miles, arrive at the Slough Channel Bridge. Continue straight over the Bridge to explore the Bellefields Loop Trail, or turn left to continue on the Heritage Loop Trail back to the Winters House.Continuing on the Heritage Loop Trail, walk along a dirt path with fencing on your left. Stop at the illustrated interpretive signs along the trail to learn about the logging industry and early settler activity within the Park.  About 0.5 miles past the Bridge, you will see signs for the Winters House Visitor Center. Turn right, following the signs for the Winters House to complete the loop.

According to many, this is the most scenic and easily-accessible stretch of the Pacific Crest Trail in Washington State. The views of the North Cascades and Pasayten are magnificent almost every step of the way, and you don’t have to work terribly hard to reach them.The road up to Windy Pass is, well, memorable. It’s full of potholes and boulders with some sizable drop offs that might make your stomach churn. Make sure to bring a sturdy car with a relatively high clearance and make your way up slowly. Once you reach the top of the road, however, you’ll be rewarded with an entirely unobstructed view of the North Cascades. This is the where the hike begins.From the trailhead, simply follow the well-maintained Pacific Crest Trail north 3.5 miles until you reach Windy Pass. You will first meander under the slopes of Slate Peak and then drop into Benson Basin where you will find more possibilities for exploring and flowers. Then head up to a spur ridge and contour to Buffalo Pass-- a nice spot for a snack and more photos--before descending to Windy Pass.As you hike along the relatively flat trail, you’ll encounter breathtaking views at every turn: Gardner Mountain, the Needles, Silver Star, Golden Horn and nearby Ballard and Azurite are to the south. Look west to Jack and Crater and look east to the Pasayten Wilderness. Time your trip right and you’ll find wildflowers decorating the sides of the trails. If your knees start to flare up, search for a ski yurt tucked into the mountainside about 2.5 miles in and make that your turn around point.Want to keep exploring? Windy Pass provides an ideal turn-around for a day hike, allowing you to return on the same trail and to view your surroundings from the opposite direction and slightly more elevation gain. Or you can spend the night in Windy Basin and enjoy plentiful opportunities for exploration. Tamarack Peak 7290 feet is an easy scramble and you can also meander over to Foggy Pass.WTA Pro Tip: Whether you do this at the beginning of your trip or at the end, make sure you leave time for short side-trip to the fire lookout on the summit of Slate Peak."

The way is steep, hot, and entails a whole lot of vertical rise. But the trailhead is easy to reach, the trail is in good shape, and views are practically nonstop. And did I mention all the flowers?If your intent is solely to summit Rock Mountain, it's a much easier pursuit via the Snowy Creek Trail. Via Rock Lake there are over 4000 feet of vertical to subdue, on lightly forested southern slopes. In summer the heat can be stifling. However, that same heat melts snow fast, often providing an early season high-country probe. The snow in the basin just below Rock's summit, where Rock Lake sits, often doesn't melt out until well into July. These snowfields can be dangerous and are best avoided unless you're experienced with an ice ax.Starting beneath high-tension wires, follow a service road. At 0.3 mile make a sharp turn left onto another service road and follow  it to its end at 0.6 mile, where real trail begins (elev. 3000 ft). On brushy-at-times but decent tread, climb! My guidebook predecessor Harvey Manning says there are ninety-five switchbacks along the way. I didn't count them but I'm not discounting his claim.Up and around ledges and across grassy slopes, be sure while you're catching your breath to look down to admire a myriad of blossoms, and look out to take in the beauty of the Chiwaukum Mountains. At 4000 feet Douglas-firs offer some shady relief. At 4800 feet the grade eases. Now in cool subalpine forest, the way marches up a rib. Don't be alarmed by the artillery warning sign-just don't venture off the trail here.Thinning forest soon yields to heather meadows and striated slabs of rock. Views to the south are now awesome. Arrowhead, Jim Hill, Daniel, Hinman, and the Chiwaukums! After 4.3 endurance-testing miles, reach a junction with the Nason Ridge Trail (elev. 6100 ft).For Rock Mountain, head left climbing another 600 feet up steep meadows, cresting a ridge, and turning right at a junction to follow a short spur to the 6852-foot summit. Views are simply sublime from this former fire lookout post. From Glacier Peak to Rainier to Howard along Nason Ridge to hundreds of other summits near and far-wow!For Rock Lake, head right. Upon rounding a ridge you'll see the alpine lake revealed in a rugged basin 200 feet below. To reach it descend through rock, meadow, and snow. Take care not to trample fragile shoreline vegetation. If mosquitoes are in full force (which they usually are throughout the summer), retreat to a windy ledge back above the lake."

Either would be a worthy destination by themselves and combined they are a great day on the trail.From the parking lot, where a Northwest Forest Pass is required, the trail follows an old road bordered by towering salmonberry bushes and deciduous trees. The berries ripen in early to mid June and the best ones are found high above your head.Once the trail leaves the old road bed it enters a dense forest and begins climbing. At 1.7 miles a signed trail to the right leads up to Bridal Veil Falls. It's a half-mile up to the falls, much of it climbing steeply up stairs. The trail splits near the falls forming a loop. Stay low and to the left to get the big view of the falls, then climb the stairs along the water for a more personal and often soaking visit. Exercise caution near the water, especially with children. The creek can sweep hikers off their feet and down the hill.Back on the main trail to Serene Lake the route crosses the creek then begins the final climb. It's a steady ascent using stairs, roots, and rocks for the final 1.5 miles gaining 1,300 feet.Keep your eyes open for patches of bunchberry and other shade-loving flowers, especially as you leave the dense forest for the sun-dappled traverse to the ridge.Once the trail crosses into the basin it's hard not to run down the hill to the lake, but stick to the trail. In an area as popular as Lake Serene it's important to practice the principles of Leave No Trace and good wilderness etiquette. Across the water the cliffs of Mt. Index rise 3,000 feet straight up and snow is piled at the base after a winter full of avalanches.Follow the trail along the shore to a huge rock perfect for a seat while you contemplate the serenity of nature.The Lake Serene trail is immensely popular resulting in scarce parking on nice days. Arrive early to miss the crowds on the way up, but practice good trail etiquette and yield to climbers as you descend.WTA Pro Tip: Round trip to Lake Serene only is 7.2 miles. If you decide to include the detour to Bridal Veil Falls, do so on the way to the lake. Don't save it for the return as it's too easy to skip the steep climb when the trailhead is so close."

Easily one of the most rewarding hikes in the area, its relatively short 2.7 mile, 2,300 feet ascent gifts you 360-degree views of Mount Baker, Mount Rainier and the Olympics from its shelter lookout, which sits nestled on a summit that tops out around 5,300 feet. This calf-friendly journey is all made possible by a high elevation trailhead, which sets you off on your travels around 3,000 feet, cutting what would otherwise be an arduous ten mile roundtrip in half. All these alluring elements also make Pilchuck one of the busiest hikes in the area, so expect company along the way. Catching the trail on a quiet day is ideal, but even on weekdays the structure can take on hostel-like conditions as hikers gather, vying for space to spend the night in the first-come, first-served lookout. Don’t let Pilchuck’s popularity fool you, however. Even with its heavy foot traffic and respectable grade, this peak should not be mistaken for a bunny hill. There are perilous elements, especially in winter, when snow may obscure the path, leading hikers to improvise and become lost. Hikers often have to be rescued from the mountain, so please take all the necessary precautions before tackling the trail. It is always encouraged that you check in with the ranger and sign the registry at the trailhead before starting your journey.To begin, depart the trailhead and reach an immediate fork. The left trail is a false path, so steer right and get your feet wet crossing a stream, christening your journey up Mount Pilchuck. After about a quarter mile, you will see an “entering Pilchuck State Park” sign. It's seen better days, but it reaffirms your course and destination. There is sparse signage from this point on. It is not a particularly hazardous trail early on, but depending on the season, you could be dealing with rocky, snowy and wet conditions on the latter part of the trip, so be prepared for anything. Traction devices and poles are strongly encouraged if snow is present on the trail. You will encounter a scree slope at the one-mile mark (the elevation marker should be about 3,500 feet for reference). Do not attempt to scramble upward. Instead, look for an orange marker that guide you left through the boulder field and lead you back to the defined trail. After another half mile, you will depart the forest and reach a clearing. Unless cloud cover is obscuring it, the fire lookout should be visible at the summit. Use this landmark as reference, as hikers have been known to gravitate toward false summits and place themselves in danger. After snaking up the exposed slope, you will reach the cone of the summit. There should be a brown “Parking Area” sign on a tree pointing returning hikers back down the slope you have just hiked up. This will be the last vestige of signage before reaching the lookout. If you do not see this sign and are not confident of your whereabouts, it is possible that you have wandered toward one of the false summits. On the right trail, you will continue on, winding around the peak until you eventually reach the top of the mountain and its sublime restored fire lookout.  Sit, eat and enjoy your time in the shelter. Originally constructed in 1921 (almost ten years after the first trail on the mountain was established), the fire lookout now stands today as a proud landmark for the area. The shelter has endured numerous renovations over the years and continues to be one of the most popular and in-demand lunch spots in Washington. Reservations are not necessary, however, as even on the busiest of days, spirits are high with summiters and the atmosphere is always welcoming and inclusive, even between large parties that camp out on the benches and outlying boulders. It’s hard not to find a smiling face on top of this picturesque peak. A social mountain, indeed. And one that should not be missed.WTA Pro Tip: If you find the Pilchuck experience daunting, try the nearby Heather Lake trail instead. Its lower elevation journey may be the warm up you need before taking on the more demanding Pilchuck trail."

The hike to the lake combines the best of mountain rainforests, old-growth, wetlands, and mountain views, yet it is readily accessible. In winter the route lends itself to snowshoeing.The origin of Lake Twentytwo’s distinct name is uncertain, but a leading theory is that nineteenth-century railroad maps listed local creeks numerically; one particular creek and its source lake were assigned “22.” The name stuck, and in 1947 the 790-acre Lake Twenty Two Research Natural Area (RNA) was created, putting an end to logging and allowing future generations to appreciate the remaining old-growth cedars and hemlocks.At the trailhead, set out on a well-maintained track that quickly becomes a mountain rainforest trail. Substantial effort has gone into building a trail that can withstand the perpetual beating from the arch-enemy of all trails, water. Gravel, turnpikes, stone steps, puncheon bridges, and more turnpikes make a sustainable trail surface possible. There is always ""water on trail"" here, but the dampness allows ferns and moss to flourish in the Mountain Loop rainforest, and provides a trail environment fascinating to little ones. The trail climbs steadily through the forest of western hemlock, mountain hemlock, alder, and red cedar. Old-growth hemlock and cedar giants have managed to persist due to the RNA. Substantial segments of the lower trail cross active creekbeds, so plan on wearing footwear appropriate for fording small creeks. At 0.6 miles, there is a bridge crossing over Twentytwo Creek, giving your boots a break from keeping your feet dry. But the ample water supply keeps salmonberry, thimbleberry, bunchberry, arnica, and bleeding heart growing thick all along the way. You are never far from the rush of water, and several waterfalls are located close to the trail. At 1.5 miles, leave the forest and climb a talus slope, where western columbine makes an appearance in the summer. This middle segment offers views of Whitehorse Mountain and Three Fingers on clear days. Trudging onward, reenter the forest at 2.1 miles. Shortly thereafter, the terrain takes on a wetland character, with skunk cabbage blooming in the spring. When you reach the bridge over Lake Twentytwo's outflow, you have traveled 2.7 miles through lush rainforest. Marvel at the sheer northern face of Mount Pilchuck, with its waterfalls and (sometimes) booming avalanches in winter and spring. Take in the reflections of rock, sky, and evergreens on the surface of a pristine alpine cirque.WTA Pro Tip: There is a trail around Lake 22, but please keep to it. The boulder field above may be tempting to scramble, but it is dangerous to navigate. Fatalities have occurred when groups of hikers have ventured up the boulder field."

The first mile of trail will be busy on a weekend, but after passing a junction with the Granite Mountain trail, some of the crowds disperse – or at least spread out. Continue hiking along the wide Pratt Lake Trail, crossing several sweet streams fed by snowbanks high up on the flanks of Granite. In early spring, these stream crossings can be high, even treacherous, so evaluate each crossing for safety according to your own ability. Three miles in, you’ll come to a junction. The left-hand fork leads to the Ollalie Lake Trail in just 0.2 miles. Some hikers may duck down this trail, but press on! Climb a gentle grade, and within a third of a mile reach a clear spot in the trail. Here Ollalie Lake lies still and green in the valley below you, and Rainier hovers above. In this open area, beargrass flourishes in early spring. It’s a great spot for a snack and photo opportunity. After your snack, continue uphill to the Pratt Lake junction. The trail to your right leads to a large sapphire-like lake on the north side of the ridge you're on. To get to Island and Rainbow Lakes (which remind hikers more of emeralds), follow it to the left. You'll continue a further mile along the south slopes of Pratt Mountain to a high point. Here you're faced with a decision. Turn left off the main trail and descend 0.4 miles to Island Lake, or hang a right and drop a half mile to Rainbow Lake.Either location is a good one, and luckily a bootpath connects the two lakes, so you can visit both before heading back the way you came.

Best of all, this alpine rapture is achieved with minimal effort. The trail starts high and stays high. And with the trail's gentle ups and down, most hikers young and old, two and four legged will have no problem making the journey.Start on a Cat track on the edge of a burn that scorched thousands of acres of high-country forest surrounding Harts Pass. In two minutes reach Trail No. 2000, the Pacific Crest Trail. The trail right heads to Canada. The trail left heads to Mexico via Grasshopper Pass-take it.In no time break out of the forest into an open basin punctuated with tall larches. You may notice flagging and other disturbances below. They're remnants of the Brown Bear Mine. The region is littered with old mines, some still active, but none yielding much these days.Gently climb, rounding the open basin, views expanding with each step, and reach a ridge crest at 0.75 mile. The way is all alpine now as the trail skirts steep slopes. Gaze south into the glacially carved South Fork Trout Creek valley. Its U-shaped symmetry indicates past glaciations (V-shaped valleys signify the past work of creeks and rivers).At 2 miles (elev. 7000 ft) attain a small gap high on Tatie Peak's eastern shoulder. Marvel at the array of geological diversity at your feet. Shale, slate, sandstone, and granite-it rocks! Speaking of slate, the peak bearing that name can be seen off to the north. It's the one with the attractive fire tower gracing its summit.Hikers comfortable with off-trail travel may want to continue along the ridge crest for 0.5 mile, climbing 400 feet to Tatie Peak's 7386-foot summit. It's not overly difficult; just be aware of the drop-off along the northern slopes. Peak baggers can help themselves to a heaping of visual delights. The prominent summits of Jack, Crater, Azurite, Tower, Robinson, and Ballard can all be sampled from Tatie's wide open perch.The trail, however, forgoes those views, traversing Tatie's southern slopes to gently descend to another gap (elev. 6800 ft). Squeaky ground squirrels and whistling marmots will accompany you. Sneak a peek at the gap to impressive Mount Ballard and below to Slate Creek, where the mining community of Chancellor once bustled.From this point, the trail continues to descend, now through alpine rock gardens and a majestic stand of larches. Pass this way in October and be wooed by a golden hue. Snow patches often blotch the heather meadows, providing the only water along the way. Bottoming out at 6500 feet in a boulder field, the way once again climbs and at 5 miles reaches 7125-foot Grasshopper Pass.Don't call it quits here, however. Continue a little farther on the broad gap, leaving the trail just before it drops steeply to Glacier Pass. Locate well-defined tread heading south, and follow it for about 0.5 mile to a 7125-foot knoll. Now revel in the shadows of all 8000-plus feet of impressive Mount Ballard and Azurite Peak. Admire, too, the prominent cloud-piercing Golden Horn and Tower Peak. And don't forget to set your sights downward to the confluence of crashing creeks that create the majestic Methow River."

Enjoy an eagle's perspective of the West Fork Methow River, Early Winters Creek, Rattlesnake Creek, Robinson Creek, and Lost River valleys, pretty portals to rugged peaks and the Pasayten Wilderness. Melting out early, Driveway Butte makes a good spring high-country probe-great, too, for enjoying blooms. In May and June half the way bursts with showy yellow arrowleaf balsamroot.Except during the autumn hunting season, expect to see few other two-legged trail users on this hike. Four-legged users, however, abound, especially deer. After late June when the balsamroot blossoms turn to seed, the butte is hot and dry. Carry plenty of water and sunscreen. Early season is best for a visit, but expect to encounter some snow midway; routefinding is easy if the skies are clear.Begin with a very short stretch of level walking before heading up an old skid road. Through an open forest of ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir, waste no time gaining elevation. At 0.5 mile the trail swings east to slab up a sunny southern slope. Thousands of sunflowers, as balsamroot is colloquially called in these parts, help brighten the way. The trail was once used to drive cattle to the butte's high meadows for range, hence this peak's name. There are no cattle left to rustle, but plenty of lizards rustle in the low brush.Humming ""Wichita Lineman,"" undulate between patches of forest and wide-open former rangeland, climbing steeply and gaining 1800 feet in 2 miles on one heck of a driveway. The way levels as it enters what was once dense forest, now burnt snags and feisty new undergrowth thanks to a large wildfire that swept through shortly after the millennium. Near a creek crossing (dry by midsummer) a faint path leads right 0.5 mile to a 5500-foot view-granting knoll, an option for a shorter saunter.The main trail continues left through a matchstick forest, crossing-depending on the season-either a series of snowmelt streams or dry draws. At 3.25 miles (elev. 5500 ft) the trail turns right (northeast), emerging in meadows and parkland below the butte. The tread disappears, but the way is quite clear-head straight up the open south slopes of the butte, an occasional cairn providing a beacon.At 4 miles crest the 5982-foot butte and reap your scenic rewards. To the north, 8726-foot Robinson Mountain dominates the horizon, and Lost River is fully revealed. Look east down the Methow Valley with Goat Peak hovering above. Giants Gardner and Silver Star draw your attention southward, while the Harts Pass high country piques your interest to the west. Grouse, chickadees, nutcrackers, and bluebirds provide the score for this stunning preview."

The trail spans the width of the Pasayten Wilderness and is part of the much larger Pacific Northwest National Scenic Trail. The combination of stunning scenery and lack of crowds is one of the BT’s most enticing aspects especially in autumn, when colors are changing, temperatures are cooling and bugs are gone. A number of places along the trail are so special that you’ll have the images etched into your memory for years to come.Starting at the Irongate trailhead west of Loomis—and doing the trip east to west—means reaching the hallowed meadows of Horseshoe Basin on the first day of your trip. You’ll reach the portal of 7,200-foot Sunny Pass at 5.2 miles and the view of the vast meadows will be but an introduction to the scenic feast ahead. Camping is available at several places in the basin, but in late season Loudon Lake may be the only available water. From Horseshoe Basin, the Canadian border is just a mile away via easy cross-country travel. Continuing westward over mostly open terrain with views, the Tungsten Mine is reached at 21 miles. Several rusty mining relics can be found near the trail. When you reach Apex Pass a few miles farther, you’re presented with your first views of craggy Cathedral Peak, unlike anything else in the Pasayten. At 26 miles you’ll reach 7,600-ft Cathedral Pass, then head down to upper Cathedral Lake near the base of the impressive 8,360-foot Amphitheater Mountain. Camping is good here, and you’ll want time to savor the ambiance. If you’ve built in a layover day, or have a few hours to spare, consider the extra few miles for the unmarked trail up the south side of Amphitheater Mountain. This horse trail goes nearly to the top and the views include most of the Pasayten Wilderness. Leaving the Cathedral Lakes behind, the views continue as you hike west, with bulky 8,685-foot Remmel Mountain being front and center. This is followed by a long descent to the log crossing over the Ashnola River at 38 miles. Across the river is a 2,000 foot climb to more big meadows near 6,900-foot Peeve Pass at 42 miles. Following the pass, trail conditions begin to deteriorate before it climbs right over the top of 7,240-foot Bunker Hill. Stop for lunch here before descending a bit more than 3,000 feet to the Pasayten River. Ford the river—a detour downstream may be necessary—then hike upstream for 7 miles to the site of the old Three Forks Cabin. Here is a pivotal trail junction where three streams of the Pasayten come together.One of the biggest challenges of hiking the entire 80-plus-mile Boundary Trail is where to exit. The “official” ending descends to Ross Lake via the Castle Pass and Lightning Creek trails. However, this section receives little maintenance and is not recommended. From Three Forks Junction, one option heads south up the Middle Fork Pasayten Trail to exit via Slate Pass. Hiking out via the West Fork Pasayten Trail exits near Slate Peak. Two other options provide access to the Pacific Crest Trail via either Woody Pass or Holman Pass. From Holman Pass, longer options exist to hike over Devils Dome to Ross Lake or McMillan Park to Hwy 20.Hiking out via the mostly forested Middle Fork Pasayten River is the shortest way out to the Slate Pass trailhead (Harts Pass area, 80 hiking miles from Irongate).WTA Pro-Tip: If you like to get off the trail and scramble easy summits, the Boundary Trail was made for you. At 8,100 feet, Armstrong Mountain is a long mile from Horseshoe Basin and takes you right to U.S.–Canadian border. Haig Mountain is higher, but Teapot Dome at 7,610 feet is just a half-mile from the Boundary Trail. 8,300 foot-high Apex Mountain is almost mandatory, given the legendary views of Cathedral Peak. From the 7,100-foot pass, Bald Mountain looms 7,930 feet high over the Ashnola River, and Sheep Mountain, at 8,275 feet, near Peeve Pass will each take at least a few hours of your time."

Just 1.2 miles from the trailhead, you’ll arrive at a campground and a stunning view of Ninetynine Basin, with Whistler Mine directly across from you. Continue another 3.7 miles through Buffalo Pass and reach Windy Pass, about 5 miles from the trailhead at an elevation of 6,300 feet. Keep your eyes peeled here for mountain goats, coyotes, and other wildlife as you traverse the ridgelines. At Windy Pass you’ll enter the Pasayten Wilderness, and soon after you’ll be tracing the northeast flanks of Tamarack Peak—keep your eye out for larches here. A mile from Tamarack Peak, venture through Foggy Pass and then through Jim Pass. It’s 7.5 miles from here to Holman Pass. At Jim Pass you’ll begin a traverse around Devils Backbone, a craggy mass capped by Jim Peak, at 7033 feet. You’ll also enjoy views of the Cascades, Mount Baker, Glacier Peak, Canada, and the surrounding Pasayten Wilderness. The views continue as you ascend to 6100 feet, north of Jim Peak and the east edge of Devil’s Backbone, 4 miles from Jim Pass, then begin a switchbacking descent to Holman Pass at 5100 feet. WTA Pro Tip: From Holman Pass, there are three options for further adventures. Turn left to visit Sky Pilot Pass, 2.5 miles away.

Look for trillium on the river side of the trail in the spring. Avoid the social trail that is visible going down to the water; there are better places to get to the river ahead.Head down a steep, but short hill to a swampy area. In spring it's full of skunk cabbage and in summer, salmonberries. Cross a short bridge and stay on the main trail, you'll arrive at your first river access just off the trail.In this pool boulders separate the main current from the shallows. The pool is full of little fish and often dogs chasing sticks. During the record floods in 2006, the gauge upstream showed 9,000 cfs (cubic feet per second), and the trail beside the river was completely destroyed. Today, you can see the undercut bank and imagine how high the river was. Flooding also did damage to this trail in 2014, but it has since been repaired and hikers can now access the entirety of the trail.Climb away from the river, through the woods, to a large rock reminiscent of a turtle at the base of a decent sized hill. Up the hill are a series of switchbacks. Though it may be tempting to take a shortcut, make sure you stay on the main trail to limit your impact on the park.It's here the climbing begins in earnest. When you come to The Benches you've completed the first hill and are rewarded with a partial view of the Lower Falls. It's often blustery at the Benches as North Bend's infamous wind slams into the hill, so bundle up if you think you may stop here. This provides a good stopping point if necessary, but you're not too far from the main attraction. If you decide to continue, descend a couple hundred feet to the bottom of the hill, on the newly rebuilt trail (as of 2016) that bypasses a slide. At the bottom of the hill you'll find the Big Tree. The fence has collapsed, but stay back from the base. Soil compaction can harm the ecosystem around the ancient tree.The trail begins to ascend the second hill, switchbacking gradually to another summit, and then a set of descending steps lead to the best view of the Lower Falls you can get. It can be crowded, but it's worth the 104 steps on the way back up. Remember to yield to uphill climbers, especially on the stairs.You're nearly to the falls, but first you'll navigate a final set of stairs down to the Big Bridge. From the bridge you'll have great views up and down the valley, including the two cascades upstream. (Yes, that makes three separate waterfalls that are collectively known as ""Twin Falls."") A few more stairs and another steep slope will get you to the upper overlook for a better view of the Upper Falls.You can continue about another mile up the trail to join the John Wayne Trail and the Homestead Valley Trailhead, but it climbs into the trees and above the freeway. The trail never returns to the river beyond the bridge and traffic can be loud.Since the trail is at the bottom of the valley for most of its route and the trees limit long views, hikers get to focus on the nature nearby. Look for walls of maidenhair ferns, flowers blooming throughout the spring and early summer, and evidence of the herd of elk that lives in the area.If you're beginning your hike from the Homestead Valley trailhead, hike along the Iron Horse Trail for about a third of a mile before coming to a junction with the Twin Falls Trail. Switchback down hillsides and through lush green forest, until you arrive at the beautiful falls and the Big Bridge."

The first mine claim near Copper City was filed by James T “Cap” Simmons in 1889. Many other claims soon followed. A man named Reuben Root eventually bought the claim at Copper City and he is credited with sparking and maintaining investment interest in the area. By 1906 many claims in the area had been consolidated into the Copper Mining Company group.By 1910 Copper City had cabins, a bunkhouse, a sawmill, a blacksmith shop, and an ore mill. An elaborate water system provided the cabins with running water and newly installed telephone lines allowed communication with the outside world. The ore mill at Copper City separated rock that contained precious metals from non-valuable “country rock”. The resulting concentrated ore was then transported by horse and cart to a railroad line which in turn transported it to a smelter in Tacoma. The smelter completed the process of extracting the precious metals from the ore. In 1917 the US Bureau of Mines reported that the Copper Mining Company had shipped five tons of ore to the smelter. This ore contained 170 ounces of silver and 1,486 pounds of copper. When plans were made to run a rail line directly to Copper City, the town’s founders hoped the increased accessibility would cause a boom. Much to their disappointment the tracks were never put down. In the end the mines around Copper City never produced the riches that were expected. In 1948 all of the machinery in the town was moved to more profitable mining areas.To reach Copper City you will walk the old mine-to-market road into town. On your left you will see the mostly-collapsed remains of the bunkhouse, and a little farther on you will encounter the remnants of the old ore mill."

Douglas Wilderness day hikes, especially for parents with children. The first of the twins is only about 2 miles down a moderately climbing trail, so plenty of people make their way there. The second lake is 0.5 mile farther and is worth the extra effort, if only to escape the majority of the crowds.The trail climbs modestly from the trailhead, rounding the snout of a low ridge above the broad basin of Twin Lakes in about 1.5 miles. The forest along this early section of trail holds a good population of squirrels--you might catch a glimpse of them leaping and gliding from tree to tree. Also listen for the head-banging hammering of woodpeckers as they search for insects in the many dead snags standing in this old forest.Visit in mid-September and you might earn a special treat. The resident elk go into their rut (mating season) in early autumn as the weather turns colder. As part of the rut ritual, the elk bulls challenge each other with eerie calls. This bugling resonates off the hills, creating a wonderful wild soundtrack for your hiking experience.After rounding the ridge snout, the trail descends gradually to the first of the twins at 2 miles. The path then follows along the shoreline for a few hundred yards before slanting to the left to cross a broad meadowland and, in 0.5 mile, reaching the second, smaller twin.Continue on around to the southeast side of the lake, branching off to the right into meadows.

The trail climbs just 300 feet more to the pass, steadily opening up views of the forested ridges of the Nannie Creek and Walupt Lake basins.  Cispus Pass is a small saddle at 6400 feet, with views east to the headwaters of the Klickitat River. The PCT continues to beckon southward, clinging to the side of the hill for another half-mile until passing back over to the west side of the ridge and dropping steeply to the intersection of the PCT with the Nannie Ridge trail 98 at 1.9 miles from the pass. Pretty little alpine Sheep Lake at 5800 feet is just past the junction, with a few more nice camps nearby, accessible from either trail. Follow Nannie Ridge with just a few ups and downs for about 2.5 miles to a junction and a nice little scramble route to the top of Nannie Peak, or another two miles with a final steep downhill to the Walupt Lake trailhead at 4000 feet, 6.4 miles from Cispus Pass.The best way to finish this hike is by placing a second car at Walupt Lake. It is, however, possible to hike back up to the Snowgrass Flat trailhead at Chambers Lake. The approximate distance from Walupt to Chambers is six miles, and it is on a fairly rough trail that requires a fording and some trail-finding skills.Follow the trail along the road (or just walk on the road) exiting the campground just past the horse camp, about 1.6 miles from the lake. Then go right (north) on Trail 7A as it returns to your car at Chambers Lake. One mile into trail 7A back to Chambers Lake you will come to a river that requires a slippery, boots off, knee-high fording. When you first approach the river, continue on the trail until it dead ends at the river shore - don't take the first river access trail. Across the river on a tree is a very tiny sign that says 7A. Look for the orange marking tape in in the tree branches. That's where the trail picks up again. 7A signs are infrequent and hard to spot but will keep you on route until you emerge from the trail onto a forest road with firepit remains. Take the road left for about an eighth of a mile until you see the 7A sign as the trail picks up again on the left side of the road. Take 7A until you come to another road; the trail continues straight across but is not marked. Following this unmarked trail, you will come to a third road. Take a right down the road and the take your first left on the first intersection you encounter (50 ft). Continue on this road for some time as it becomes quite overgrown in places, and will eventually connect with the wide gravel road you drove in on. Go right (uphill) to get back to the Snowgrass trailhead. WTA Pro Tip: There are segments of trail 7A that parallel the road - try to find and use them as they are a shorter distance than walking the road."

Volcanoes loom on all sides: Mount Rainier, Mount Adams, Mount St. Helens, and on clear days, even Mount Hood can be seen far to the south. But it's not just the big snow-capped cones that are seen. Lesser volcanoes-perfectly formed cinder cones-can be seen scattered throughout the southern Cascades, in addition to the ancient volcanic peaks of the Goat Rocks. Actually, the peaks along the Goat Rocks Crest are the last remaining bits of an ancient volcano that formed and collapsed long before the current peaks poked up. A short spur trail leads west from the trailhead, and in less than 0.25 mile it joins the Snowgrass Flat Trail (No. 96). Starting out in heavy forest cover, the trail crosses Goat Creek near the 2-mile mark and swings into a cedar swamp. This swamp is one of the reasons I recommend early autumn as the prime hiking season. By waiting until September to enjoy this hike, you'll find the high pass snow-free and the swamp will be mostly bug-free. Hike in August, and there will likely be snowfields at the pass, and swarms of blood-hungry mosquitoes in the swamp. Of course, the marsh is a mere quarter mile long, so if you do come here in the summer months, a bit of bug dope and a fast pace will protect you from the worst of the bugs. Once past the wetlands, the trail climbs 1100 feet in the next 2 miles to reach the lower meadows of Snowgrass Flat at 4.1 miles."

Walk along a hillside above a small valley, pause at a viewpoint overlooking a lake, and stroll through grassy meadows with stunning views of Mount Rainier. In season enjoy an abundance of wildflowers or perhaps a handful of huckleberries. The hike follows the Pacific Crest Trail on the northern flank of Naches Peak and the Naches Peak Trail on the southern flank. The loop is best done clockwise for outstanding views of Mount Rainier. This hike begins at Tipsoo Lake and then traverses a steep hillside on the northern flank of Naches Peak. As you climb a gentle slope, you will look down on a small lush valley that is a wildflower heaven. In late July and early August you may be treated to a flower festival including blue lupine, white bistort, and magenta paintbrush. Along the way you will pass an unnamed lakelet where you may be tempted to take off your boots and go wading.  As the loop wraps around the east side of Naches Peak, the trail comes to a viewpoint with Dewey Lake over 600 feet below. The smooth rock bench here makes an excellent place to eat lunch or take a break. This is a popular place, however, so be prepared to share the experience with others.  On the southern side of Naches Peak, you will cross alpine meadows with stunning views of Mount Rainier. This is an exceptionally picturesque area, and it is easy to get fantastic photos here. Many people feel this is the highlight of the loop.For this hike, start at the Tipsoo Lake parking lot. Follow the trail northeast around the lake to the Pacific Crest Trail parking lot. Cross to the south side of the highway then follow the Pacific Crest Trail around the northern flank of Naches Peak. Just after the Dewey Lake viewpoint, the Pacific Crest Trail comes to a junction with the Naches Peak Loop trail. Go right and follow the Naches Peak Loop trail back to the Tipsoo Lake parking lot."

Follow the trail south through pocket meadows and stands of forest brimming with summer wildflowers and berries, to shallow Cultus Lake. Here, a 0.3- mile side trail heads east to vibrant Blue Lake, an ideal camping location if you're getting a late start, or a nice side trip if you want to add miles. Continue south on a gentle descent for 0.4 mile to a fork in the trail. The right fork cuts across the southern extension of Bird Mountain, past Clear Lake, to connect to the PCT for a shorter loop option. You'll bear left, heading eastward a short distance before returning to a southerly heading. The trail opens up and traverses several wide meadows, many chock-full of tasty huckleberries at peak season. Pass Lemei Lake in a wide, grassy basin, then make a short, switchbacking climb over a low, forested ridge before descending to glittering Junction Lake, aptly named for its location at the trail junction with the PCT.A couple of nice campsites can be found in the trees here, just off the trail. To continue the loop, hop on the PCT and head north, climbing ever so gradually through shady forest. At 1.6 miles from Junction Lake, come to another junction at Bear Lake. Here, a side trail breaks off west 0.5 mile to Elk Lake. For a fantastic campsite, proceed about a hundred yards past the junction and find a bootpath descending to the peninsula jutting out into the lake, where you’ll find two campsites in the trees, and a small rocky  beach just beyond. The loop continues north on the PCT as the trail passes high above Deer Lake and arrives at yet another junction. This is the other side of the cutoff that passes Clear Lake. Continue another 2 miles north on the PCT. Pass the junction for Placid Lake and traverse a wide rockfall slope where pikas are frequently seen and heard, to the final junction on the loop: the Cultus Creek Cutoff. Veer right off the PCT for a short, steep climb over the pass, now on the north side of Bird Mountain. At the top, look for a bootpath that branches off left to a viewpoint atop a rocky outcrop and take in all of the South Cascades’ glory. The final 1.5 miles is a steep descent to the Cultus Lake Campground and your car.WTA Pro Tip: Knock off a few miles of the famed Pacific Crest Trail along the west side of this idyllic loop in one of Washington’s least-visited wildernesses."

If a sunrise hike is a tall order, don’t worry. The views from Sunrise Peak are marvelous all day. Whether it’s a cloudless sky, or fog shrouds the hillsides, you want to make sure you have your camera for this hike. Though it’s only a mile and a half to the summit, the trail is steep and in some places the tread is in less-than-optimal condition. Fortunately, plentiful vistas and overlooks make good places to catch your breath. Begin from the small parking lot, taking the trail that heads southwest along the shoulder of Sunrise Peak. The trail gets right down to business as you head uphill and into the dark forest. As you gain elevation, the close forest gives way to more open trees with wildflowers: beargrass, indian paintbrush, lupine, and yarrow, to highlight a few. After a little more than a half mile of hiking, break out onto a flat section of trail with a big view. Mount Adams dominates the horizon to the south. Looking straight ahead, you can see Jumbo Peak, unmistakable with its jauntily tilted summit block. The panoramas here are incredible, and they’re only going to get better. Proceed down the trail about 0.2 miles to a signed junction. Though both trails eventually reach the summit of Sunrise, take the righthand trail—which is hiker-only—and begin the second half of your climb. You'll wade through meadows full of beargrass or huckleberries, depending on the season. Views of Adams improve and your vantage of Jumbo Peak changes with every step you take. As you head northeast, the flattish summit of McCoy Peak appears across the valley. Let your mind wander as you consider the hiking possibilities on the ridge across the way. After half a mile of climbing, arrive at another trail junction. The hiker-only route is well indicated here. You’re on the last stretch! It’s four tight switchbacks to a viewpoint just below the summit of Sunrise.The last push to the summit is more of a scramble. There is a handrail (there used to be a lookout here, after all) but regardless, be careful when making for the tip-top—it’s a sheer drop from the other side of the handrail. On top, you’ll be rewarded with 360 degree views including Rainier, Adams, St. Helens, Hood, and the Goat Rocks. Closer in, you can see McCoy, Langille, Craggy, and Juniper Peaks, as well as Shark Rock and Table Mountain. You can explore this ridgeline by heading north to Juniper Peak (3 miles from Sunrise’s summit) or south to Jumbo Peak (2.4 miles from the summit). Either route pays off in excellent vistas, but the trail to Juniper Peak is in rougher shape than that on the way to Jumbo. WTA Pro Tip: There are very few water sources here; the trail stays above most creeks or streams. If you decide to visit, be prepared to pack in as much water as you need for your trip."

The Pacific Crest Trail ducks the western face of Potato Hill, but the gentle cone can be climbed without much effort or difficulty. The scramble to the top is worth the effort, as it brings wonderful views of Mount Adams and the volcanic landscape of the country north of the mountain. One of the most impressive sights is the sprawling Muddy Fork Lava Bed that seems to flow from the perfect cone of Red Butte (7200 feet) on Adams's northeast slope.Potato Hill is centered on a north-south fault line that also runs under Mount Adams, and around 110,000 years ago, the mountain was formed when an eruption of basalt lava spewed out of the fissure along this fault line. The cinder cone that was left behind became Potato Hill.The Pacific Crest Trail heads north from the trailhead with the perfect cone of Potato Hill in sight all the way. The trail is relatively level and well maintained, and the vegetation is mostly low trees and brush. The trail traverses around the base of Potato Hill and explores some pretty wildflower meadows before reaching an old dirt road within 0.5 mile of the trailhead. Rather than hike to the road, pick a place to scamper off-trail and start up the gentle slope of the mini volcano. Be sure to stay on the western face of the peak, as the entire eastern side is within the Yakama Indian Reservation and is off limits to non-tribal members. The boundary isn't marked, but by staying on the west and southwest sides, you'll remain on public land. The sparse vegetation on the slopes makes climbing a warm experience when the sun is out, but it also means the top of the peak is always in sight-a quick glance up lets you know how much farther you've got to climb to get to the summit. If the 500-foot gain tires you, pull up for a breather and enjoy the wonderful views to the south and west. In addition to the beauty of Mount Adams, you'll see other prominent peaks, including Green Mountain and Hamilton Butte to the west."

The best months to hike are May through November.Ed's Trail is the more scenic and more rugged of the two paths up Silver Star, which can be hiked in a sort of loop. A popular way to visit the summit is to ascend on Ed's Trail and return via the Silver Star Trail. With rocky outcrops and a natural rock archway and meadows that burst with wildflowers in the spring, this trail highlights the high country that inspired the late Ed Robertson who co-founded the Chinook Trail Association. The trail was completed in 1996 by volunteers as part of the proposed Chinook Trail, a bi-state route that encircles the rim of the Columbia River Gorge.Start on the Silver Star Trail (180) - an old road grade that climbs fairly steeply out of the parking area. Ed's Trail is a 1.5 mile segment, but is part of a popular 5 mile hike to the Silver Star Summit, when joined with other trails in the area. From the Silver Star Trailhead, hike south for about 1 mile and stay right to begin Ed's Trail (180A), which climbs the east side of the ridge. Ed's Trail (180A) is a foot path that takes a slightly less steep route and follows along the east side of the ridge, while the Silver Star Trail traverses the west side of the ridge. The two trails meet again about 1/4 mile from the summit at the junction with the Bluff Mt. Trail. There is a short steep section on Ed's trail that requires a bit of scrambling where a slip could be very dangerous. Avoid this route when wet or icy.From the junction, continue uphill on the Silver Star Trail for another 1/4 mile and head left up a rocky road bed - the Silver Star Summit Trail (#180D). On a clear day, the views from the summit are sublime - Mounts Hood, Rainier and St. Helens, as well as the forested hills of the Gifford Pinchot National Forest and the Yacolt Burn State Forest. On the return you can retrace your route or stay on the west side of the ridge on the Silver Star Trail (#180) to get back to the trailhead. You can also keep hiking from here. Several trails meet near the Silver Star summit. Hikers can follow the Chinook Trail to the Kloochman Butte Trail (#180B) to the west or the Bluff Mountain Trail (#172) to the east."

No need for hiking boots, as it follows a paved path to the overlook.The lower parking lot at Mount Rainier’s Paradise is for visits longer than 2 hours. When the upper lot fills (early on nice days), many park at the lower lot, but never look to see the trailhead at the far (western) end. A signboard there announces the beginning of the Nisqually Vista Trail.Climb the stone stairs to the asphalt path above. Go left at the junction to Nisqually Vista. The trail climbs briefly then descends to another signed junction. You have a choice here; either direction takes you in a loop. If you wish to save the best viewpoint for last, go straight and walk the gently descending path counterclockwise, passing a few viewpoints along the way.At the farthest point (just over 0.5 mile) is the best and final viewpoint, with an interpretive sign describing the Nisqually Glacier. The glacier has receded greatly over the years, leaving what looks like an elongated gravel-covered mound, far smaller than it used to be. The bottom, or snout, of the glacier has a nearly vertical face, where meltwater from above washes over and erodes it.Marvel at the enormity of the classic U-shaped valley, and imagine when the Nisqually Glacier filled this valley with ice.When you are ready to resume, return the way you came or complete the counterclockwise loop; it’s the same distance either way.Note: Although paved, this trail is not wheelchair-accessible, due to the stone staircase at the beginning. Alternatively, the trail can be accessed from the upper parking lot via connector trails. For that route, obtain a free copy of the “Paradise Area Trails” map from the Longmire Wilderness Information Center or Paradise Visitor Center.WTA Pro Tip: This is a great winter snowshoe when the mountain above Paradise is clouded in. Simply follow the bright orange flags and poles for a delightful little loop."

At over 7800 feet, Burroughs Mountain sets right up against the northeastern face of Mount Rainier, hugging the Winthrop Glacier. It offers one of the most dramatic views of Washington's largest volcano; the landscape atop Burroughs is both broad and barren, so there is little to inhibit full exposure. Seemingly little plant life should survive this harsh, high-elevation terrain, yet the number of wildflower varieties which thrive with vibrant color on this hike may surprise you. Besides the floral displays in early summer, the wildlife seen atop this summit is a treat. Goats wander the hillsides, and chipmunks, marmots and pika skitter amongst the rocks, along the trail and atop each of the three “peaks” which define this long, tundra-like alpine mountain.The trail can be accessed from the northwest corner of the Sunrise parking lot. Note that despite warm weather in the parking lot, there is often a snowfield into the early summer on the approach to First Burroughs. Assess the situation and use great caution with steep snow travel. If you feel unsure about the crossing, save the hike for later in the season. Follow the signs to the top of Sourdough Ridge on a wide, often dusty trail. The trail heads steadily uphill, gaining 400 feet in just over half a mile. The way is well-marked and heads west to a five-way intersection at Frozen Lake. From here, follow the Burroughs Mountain Trail at it makes its way uphill to the southwest on a relatively steep stretch of trail, reaching the broad, open top of First Burroughs Mountain at roughly 7000 feet. Continue past an intersection to Second Burroughs, climbing an additional 400 feet in about half a mile. Second Burroughs offers impressive views into the Glacier Basin below, pointed Little Tahoma on a ridge of Rainier to the south, and expansive views of the park to the north, including Fremont Lookout, Berkeley and Grand Parks, and Skyscraper Mountain. With the elevation gain and mileage, Second Burroughs is a good turnaround point for most day hikers. But those after a bigger adventure can continue downhill to a saddle and intersection with the Glacier Basin trail. Stay on the trail which veers slightly right and climbs the bench that eventually leads to the high point: Third Burroughs Mountain. Extra effort is required to reach the 7800 foot rocky top, but the reward is the invigorating feeling of being so close to Mount Rainier that you could reach out and touch it.Stay a while on the top of Third Burroughs. There are plenty of big, flat rocks on which to sit and listen to the sounds of rock fall and the groaning mountain. Peek over the edge to the west and count the crevasses in the Winthrop Glacier formed along the contour of this volcano. Study the Inter Glacier for tiny climbers making their way to Camp Schurman and the eventual summit. Enjoy the views; they are stunning!WTA Pro Tip: This area can be done as a loop. Access the trail using a trailhead on the south side of the Sunrise parking area. Travel in a clockwise direction and pass Shadow Lake on level trail, then climb sharply to an overlook on the White River and Emmons Glacier. Beyond the overlook the route continues up and onto the wide, flat plateau of First Burroughs Mountain, reaching the above mentioned five-way intersection at Frozen Lake. Here you can continue on to Second Burroughs using above directions or hike east another 1.4 miles back to the Sunrise parking lot in a loop."

From the parking lot the trail quickly descends into the canyon on a paved path with a gentle grade. The first section is perfect for everyone from youngsters new to hiking to those with stubborn knees. This section comes to an end at the waterfall viewpoint. Below, the trail becomes more difficult as the route narrows and skirts along high cliffs. This segment forms a loop, which crosses over a 125-foot suspension bridge torn from the pages of a Hollywood movie script. On the bridge you will be treated to an amazing view of the canyon below and gushing water right under your feet. The sight can be unnerving, so watch your footing.The trail eventually returns on the south side of the canyon, crossing a steel bridge upstream of the waterfalls and rejoins the paved trail. But before you get there you will need to drop farther into the canyon. If you are fearful of heights, this segment is not for you. After the bridge, the trail crosses an exposed face, followed by a water crossing, where a cable is present to assist hikers make the ford. A metal ladder then descends a vertical cliff providing access to the canyon’s thunderous waterfalls.The trail soon intersects Ship Trail (the return route), which climbs to a viewpoint atop a lava formation that overlooks a long series of waterfalls in the lower canyon. A bit further, the canyon begins to broaden and flatten as it approaches a large alluvial fan spreading into the Smith Creek valley.WTA Pro Tip: For more volcanic geology, check out the nearby Trail of Two Forests, the location where a series of lava tubes formed when a lava flow crawled through an old growth forest and cooled.

He and the crew helped build much of the Deception Pass State Park infrastructure that still exists today. After the CCC, John settled in Anacortes and married Doris Anderson. John worked for several canneries on Fidalgo Island and then became a supervisor at Shell Puget Sound Refinery, where he worked for over 20 years before retirement.Community was a very important part of John and Doris’ lives and they made generous contributions to help the people, animals and nature of Fidalgo Island. Over the years, John ensured that the places he fell in love with would be here for future generations. Not only did he help build the infrastructure at Deception Pass State Park, but years later he and Doris donated a conservation easement on Fidalgo Bay to Skagit Land Trust. In addition, John was the largest donor in the campaign to forever protect the Anacortes Community Forest Lands."

But some 150 years ago, an earthquake collapsed much of the canyon's forested west wall, which slid into the creek, creating a natural dam in the process. Thus Canyon Lake was born. Today, evidence of the slide can be seen in the hundreds of cedar snags that poke up through the lake's surface. The Canyon Lake Community Forest was developed in 1993 after the discovery of an old growth forest. Now it's a refuge for hikers and bikers seeking a retreat from the city. Visitors may also see owls, bears, cougars, even pika.The highlight of the 2,300 acre Whatcom County Park is about three miles up the hillside. There, a 1.2 miles needle-strewn dirt trail wends its way through a 700-acre stand of old growth forest. Here hikers will find Alaska yellow cedars, hemlocks and Pacific silver firs more than 800 years old. Some of the trees may be more than 1,000 years old. It's one of the oldest forest stands known in the Pacific Northwest. Because of the relatively high elevation of the forest -- about 3800 feet -- the wonderfully gnarled trees, despite their age, are not the giants one might expect. Still, they're stately, grand, and super tenacious -- they've had dibs on this place for a thousand years. In either case, be warned -- the access road to Canyon Lake Community Forest was washed out in several places by a storm in January 2009. The road is closed at the gate, tacking on 5.7 miles to access any hike in the area. But the opportunities to see the flora and fauna - even a fossilized palm frond on the Lake Loop Trail - make this area worth the effort it takes to get there."

A parent hoping to introduce a child to the wonderful outdoors? Or maybe just a busy urban dweller searching for a quick escape from the hustle and bustle of city life? If you fit any of these descriptions, then look no further. Seward Park is the place for you!Located southeast from downtown Seattle, Seward Park resides on the Bailey Peninsula in the neighborhood that shares its name. The city of Seattle bought the peninsula in 1911 and began developing the area into a park shortly thereafter. Since then, the park has become home to a variety of educational, recreational, and cultural activities. Visitors can enjoy a 2.4 mile bike and walking loop, an amphitheater, a native plant garden, an art studio, sheltered picnic areas, slightly more challenging hiking trails, a swimming beach, and more.To start your urban adventure, begin at the Seward Park Environmental & Audubon Center. Here you’ll find restrooms, waste bags to clean up after your dog, an information kiosk with facts about the park’s plant and animal life, and knowledgeable staff members who can help you make the most of your visit. Next, head southeast from the Audubon Center toward the children’s playground to find the start of the outer bike and walking path that hugs the shoreline surrounding to park for 2.4 miles, labeled as trail #10 on the park map. This trail is paved the entire way around and can be enjoyed by people of all fitness levels and abilities. As you begin walking along the path, take note of the poison oak signs. Stay on the path or trails to avoid an itchy encounter. You’ll also notice lots of benches throughout the park to take a rest or to simply gaze out at beautiful Lake Washington. At a little over half a mile you will come to a junction with another intersecting trail, trail #2. If you’d like to cut the longer loop of the park short, make a left at this junction to cut across the park, otherwise continue straight. Shortly after this junction you will come across the site of the Seward Park Fish Hatchery built in 1935. Although the hatchery has been closed for some time, remnants of it can still be seen. Make sure to stop at the nearby information kiosk to read about its history.Continuing on, you will come to another junction at approximately 1.75 miles. From here, you can leave the paved path and head into the interior of the park, where you will find slightly more rugged, wooded trails. These trails are ideal for those looking for a challenge and a detour from the more popular outer loop; however, be mindful of roots, logs and rocks that could present an obstacle for some. The interior dirt and gravel paths are all interconnecting and no more than a mile each.After a side trip through the forest, return to the paved trail and continue heading west back toward the Seward Park Environmental & Audubon Center. You’ll encounter outstanding views of downtown Seattle, a friendly reminder that you barely have to leave the city to find an outdoor haven.  WTA Pro Tip: After working up an appetite at the park, consider stopping for lunch at the nearby Flying Squirrel Pizza Co. which features locally made ingredients including meats from Zoe's Meats, Salumi Artisan Cured Meats, and Draper Farms, locally farmed vegetables, coffee from Stumptown Coffee Roasters, and ice cream from Snoqualmie Ice Cream. Flying Squirrel has been serving up delicious pizza to the community since 2008."

The cost? The first three miles of the trail is easy, but the last half-mile to the summit is steep and occasionally brushy. Taking a break on that climb is no hardship though: the hillside is carpeted in berries and the views start early.Start at the Smithbrook trailhead, an area brushy with neck-high fireweed. Proceed through the brush on a moderate grade and quickly arrive at a more open trail through a nice forest. Pass a rocky area with giant boulders as you ascend up moderately graded switchbacks. At 1.5 miles, arrive at a junction with the Pacific Crest Trail. If you go in September, bring some fresh fruit to share with the thru-hikers bound for Canada -- you'll see quite a few from here on out.Head left (southbound) on the PCT, enjoying a relatively flat section of trail.  The open forest provides periodic views of the rocky wall on the opposite side of the valley. This is a great place to teach young children the joy of hiking. The trail is lined with blueberries and huckleberries–the perfect fuel for going just a little further.  Approximately three miles from the trailhead, just before dropping to Lake Valhalla, you’ll find a turn-off for Mt. McCausland on your right. The trail is unmarked, but an obvious switchback heads up the hillside. You’ll quickly arrive in a meadow of low blueberry and huckleberry bushes. The sudden increase in the quantity of berries should give you an idea of the relative popularity of Mount McCausland versus Lake Valhalla and the PCT below you.The switchbacks shorten and then disappear entirely as the trail charges straight up the mountain. Bring hiking poles; there are some big steps here and the trail surface is a little loose. Views of Lake Valhalla and Lichtenberg Mountain start right away, and you can still enjoy views from this trail even if you decide that attaining the summit is not part of your hiking agenda. Making it to the summit will grant additional views northeast of layers of mountains and tiny Dow Lake.It is possible to access Mount McCausland from Steven's Pass, which saves you some miles driving, but adds on miles hiking. If you choose to access this mountain this way, you'll have a 12.6 mile roundtrip hike, and you will need a Northwest Forest Pass.  WTA Pro Tip: Save your energy, if possible, and when you’re done with Mount McCausland, head down to Lake Valhalla.

With just a bit more elevation gain, and slightly more rugged terrain, it's the perfect place to take children on their first ‘real’ hike. The trail is short, but steep and challenging--it'll give a child a real sense of accomplishment once they reach the lake.. The lake itself is a scenic little lake located on the northeastern slope of Mount Pilchuck. The trail takes off just left of the large parking lot, and immediately begins to climb through old second growth forest on a series of switchbacks. As you climb through the woods, note the huge rotting stumps with the springboard notches on the side. Springboards were boards placed in tree trunks for the loggers of yore to stand on as they used a large crosscut saw to take down the tree. Notice young trees growing out of the stumps--old stumps nursing new forest. The trail reaches an old logging road, and follows it for a short distance before it begins to climb again. At this point the trail becomes very rocky and rooty and in high runoff, wet, with little streamlets running through the rocks. Watch for little waterfalls along the way. The vegetation becomes more interesting as the trail climbs. Admire from the trail the large prickly leaves and bright red berries of devils club and fern understory. You will reach a clearing in the woods as the trail takes a slight bend. After crossing the clearing, look for the wide, spreading roots of a long ago downed tree on your right. The soil has since been packed hard here by many small feet (and some big ones) posing for pictures. As you continue to climb through the forest again, notice the big old-growth trees that escaped the saws of days past. Give them a hug, then cross another small clearing, and soon the trail begins to level out. Only another quarter of a mile to go and you will be at the lake. The ground is marshy and the trail muddy, but there is a nice boardwalk across some of this. In spring the marsh will be bright yellow with the large showy flowers of skunk cabbage. You will glimpse the lake, but just before you reach it, there is a fork in the trail. The trail goes all around the lake so it really doesn’t matter which direction you choose, you will only add a little over half a mile. The right fork crosses a series of boardwalks through the woods, and then on to some fine lunch rocks on the far side of the lake. The trail left follows the shore past some nice camp spots along the water. On the east side of the lake there is an open marshy area. You will find a succession of wildflowers here, starting with the marsh marigolds and trillium and ending with fall asters. Notice the contorted mountain hemlock along this section of the trail, and speculate on what caused it to grow that way. There is also more boardwalk here that passes by a quiet little pond with some reflection picture opportunities, and nice views of Mount Pilchuck. On your way back, as you pass the outlet stream, notice all the berry bushes and make a note to revisit this little gem of a lake in the fall!  Pro Tip: This is a very popular hike on sunny weekends. Visit midweek, pack breakfast and a thermos of coffee, get there before nine, and have the lake to yourself."

A short, unmarked trail leads out to lonely Twin Lake, which lacks both a twin and the impressive landscape waiting at Summit Lake.Push on from the junction to one of the steeper sections of the hike, following the trail as it quickly ascends the ridgeline. Roughly 2.5 miles from the trailhead, emerge from the woods into the grassy meadows surrounding Summit Lake. If you’re up for more, the trail splits into a loop, winding around the lake and up to the top of Summit Lake Peak. There is often wildlife found in the meadows, including bear, deer, marmot and elk.The side trail to the Summit Peak is rough, steep and narrow, but the rewards are worth the extra effort. From the top, the deep blue of Summit Lake competes with the white flanks of Mount Rainier.

The best views of the entire route-and arguably the best views found on the western side of the monument are found just a quarter mile into the walk.

There are more than sixty-count 'em! But once you make the grade, Welcome Pass extends a warm benvenuti and a sincere invite to poke around on the wide-open slopes of the divide, drinking fine views and savoring precious alpine moments.Consider the first mile a mere warm-up. Using an old logging road, the trail gently wanders out of the valley, gaining a leisurely 400 feet. Real trail then brings real work.

Most would describe it as an easy hike--relatively short and not very steep for most of its length–-but then it suddenly changes, turning informal and rough, particularly in its last half mile, making it feel like the rugged backcountry trek it at times can be. Start out on the Ira Spring Trail. The parking lot will likely be full if you come here on a nice weekend day. Not only is Bandera a popular hike, but it shares a trailhead with the equally popular trails to Mason Lake and Mount Defiance. For the first mile and a half, it is gentle and wide as it follows an old road bed (about halfway through this first section, a water crossing may be somewhat difficult during times of heavy runoff). The trail departs the old road and heads more steeply uphill. Occasional breaks in the trees enable partial views of Rainier to the south. In another mile and a quarter, after a series of looping switchbacks, the trail to Bandera and the trail to Mason Lake part company as the way to Bandera heads straight uphill through a meadow of beargrass and bleached stumps of trees burned in a fire long ago. The next fifth of a mile is steep –- in fact, one of the steepest stretches of trail you’ll find, gaining one foot of elevation for every two feet it travels. The saving grace for those not used to this sort of climbing is that it is mercifully brief and boasts firm footing in the form of numerous rocks and boulders. The trail soon reaches a ridge and heads east along it. At times, it becomes somewhat difficult to follow as it enters minor rock fields, until reaching Little Bandera, technically a false summit. The vast majority of people turn around here after pausing to picnic among the blocky granite and stunted firs. There is nothing false about the views-–this spot provides an excellent vantage of the ridge and meadows to the south, as well as across I-90 to nearby peaks like McClellan Butte and the ubiquitous Rainier. Turning around here gives you a round trip hike of 7 miles, with about 2850 feet of elevation gain; perfectly respectable for a day hike. If you must press on to the true summit, know that the trail gets hard to follow. It drops steeply over the rocks of Little Bandera’s summit and is barely visible. You'll lose and then regain elevation as you follow the ridge. Few people venture out this way–-Bandera Mountain's actual summit is forested and holds no real attraction save for the glory of reaching a summit less than 100 feet taller than the false summit you just stood on."

A nearly-1000-feet-of-elevation-gain-per-mile price. But views of pointed Kaleetan Peak, deep blue Crystal Lake, the climber-dotted Tooth, and Mount Rainier dominating the skyline to the south make it all worth it. Begin at the Pratt Lake trailhead in cool, mossy forest, where you hike along a wide, moderately-graded tread. On the way to the junction for Granite Mountain Trail, a large switchback offers views straight up a steep, debris-filled avalanche chute. This is evidence of a real danger in the winter and early spring; hikers without avalanche gear are better off waiting until the snow has melted down before tackling Granite. After 1.2 miles, arrive at the junction. Here the Pratt Lake trail continues on a moderate grade via the left fork, but your vertical adventure is just beginning. Granite Mountain Trail heads off to the right.After the junction, the trail narrows and becomes rockier, so watch your step as you continue hiking through quiet forest. While it may be shady, it's unlikely you'll be chilly. The steep grade will keep you warm as you follow narrow switchbacks up, up, up. Just under a mile from the junction, cross the avalanche chute you peered up near the beginning of the trail. A seasonal stream runs down the chute and early in the season you can replenish your water supply from it, but don't forget to filter! Continue past the chute and traverse eastward, up onto the shoulder of Granite Mountain. When you break into high meadows, the steep grade lessens. Catch your breath and scan the horizon. How many of the summits can you identify? After orienting yourself, press on. The trail becomes increasingly rock-laden, slowing your pace as you clamber up and around large boulders. It's here that you realize just how appropriate Granite Mountain's name is. Fortunately, the views are gorgeous and huckleberry bushes line the trail. In late summer, the berries provide a rejuvenating snack. A switchback in the trail reveals the lookout that is your destination, but don't be fooled. From your first sighting of the structure it's still a mile to the summit. The trail progresses north, with the lookout on your left. Leave the fields of huckleberries and follow the narrow, rocky trail through the bottom of a basin. Enjoy the easiest part of this hike, a jaunt through a green alpine meadow bordered by a talus slope to the south. The final push is a grunt, but the views! Break out above treeline onto a talus field, and marvel at the lookout perched on the rocks. Further afield, Mount Stuart and the Teanaway are visible to the east, Rainier commands your view to the south, and if it's a clear day, you can make out Baker floating on the northern horizon. WTA Pro Tip: The Granite Mountain Lookout can accommodate a relatively small number of people. During the summer and especially on weekends, Granite Mountain can have as many as 100 hikers at its summit, so please be courteous to fellow hikers and limit your time spent exploring the lookout if there is a ranger at the summit who has opened it to the public."

At this point it seems amazing to think you will be up there by the end of your hike, but a look at a trail map will reveal some well-engineered switchbacks -- courtesy of many WTA work parties -- that will get you to your destination with less effort than you might expect. The old trail to the summit was in bad shape from heavy use and no maintenance, but WTA work parties helped create this beautiful avenue through second-growth forest to the rocky ledges. In addition to adding a half mile to the old trail, the steepness was lessened a bit.From the parking lot, head to a gate on the southeast side of the lake and follow a short service road about a quarter-mile to the trailhead.

At 1.9 miles you will reach a signed junction; though it is not signed, Rattlesnake Ledge is just to the right, about a hundred yards away.The ledge is a very exposed, large rock that has sheer cliffs, so it would be wise approach slowly if you are hiking with kids or dogs.If you wish to extend your trip you can go back to the junction where the sign points out the trail to East Peak 2.4 miles away, or the ridge traverse to Snoqualmie Park, 8.3 miles away.

And unlike many trails, which sacrifice peripheral scenery on the journey for the prospect of a grand summit view, the Woody Trail is consistently gorgeous as you wind your way along the Wallace River and approach the nine dazzling falls.  The moderate elevation gain (1300 feet, most of which occurs on a series of switchbacks between the Middle and Upper Falls) might give beginners cause to worry, but you can take comfort in the knowledge that there are still great views to be had at the more accessible Lower and Middle Falls stops. The Middle Falls overlook provides arguably the trail’s most impressive scenery with a panoramic view of the Skykomish River valley and the distant portrait of the Olympic Mountains trailing into the horizon.Wallace Falls (deriving its name from Kwayaylsh, surname of the first homesteaders in the area) trail is in great condition. Although the park sees a lot of foot traffic due to its popularity, the trail remains well maintained and relatively clean thanks in part to maintenance from WTA, who has had work parties attend to this trail over the last four years. There are some sections, especially pushing on from the Middle Falls to Upper Falls, where the way becomes more rugged, but these sections are brief. To begin, find the trailhead just off the parking lot, framed by the information kiosk and the restroom facilities. Trek under a pair of mammoth power lines, which despite doing their level best to ruin potential photo ops of Mount Index and Baring Mountain at the clearing, do not completely remove the grandeur of the view. Continue left, trading the last traces of civilization for the gentle babbling of the Wallace River as you duck under a canopy of aged hemlocks. At the half-mile marker, you will encounter a split in the trail. The path on the right, distinguished by a wooden gate (intended to signal that the trail is hiker-only from here on out), leads to the Woody Trail. The left fork diverts to the old Railroad Grade, a longer bike-accessible path. Bikers and more seasoned visitors may swing left to experience the further delights of the park, including paths that lead north to Lake Wallace, but proceed through the gate on the right to the Woody Trail if you are on foot and desire the compact Wallace Falls experience.From there, trace the Wallace River where you may catch fly fishermen playing hooky from work or any number of introspective visitors enjoying the many benches and natural nooks that the trail provides. Eventually you will break from the river and encounter the trail’s first steep climb. Continue up, encountering diversionary paths for the Amphitheater and the Railroad Grade trail, but stay on the Woody Trail until you reach the Picnic area at the Lower Falls, just two miles from the trailhead. Stop to admire the falls, but push less than half a mile for the prospects of better views at the Middle Falls, which boast the most impressive panoramic sights on the trail. There is no shame calling it a day at the Middle Falls overlook, but the hardcore, spry, or those with something to prove will power up the steepest grade of the trail, a sweat inducing half-mile of switchbacks that lead to the Upper Falls, where the path officially concludes at 2.8 miles.WTA Pro-Tip: Often known for the nine waterfalls, Wallace Falls State Park and the surrounding parks are less well-known for mountain biking, fishing, swimming, boating, kayaking and rock climbing opportunities. Visitors looking to participate in any of the ancillary activities offered should contact the park and inquire into the seasonal availability of these experiences.Dogs are allowed at Wallace Falls, but are required to be leashed at all times. There is a strictly enforced fine for unleashed dogs stemming from a number of incidents where unleashed dogs have been swept over the falls.

Although relatively steep inclines bookend this hike, this primarily north to south route is perfect for beginners who are looking to get back in shape. But with opportunities to cut away on the Boulder Garden Loop at 0.3 miles and 0.5 miles to merge with the more challenging Mount Si trail, it also accommodates veteran hikers. Expect crowds; the two Si peaks are sometimes colloquially referred to as ""Resolution Peaks"" due to the onslaught of hikers that appear after January 1st. The trail's proximity to the city and a degree of refuge from the elements often divert heavy foot traffic to this mini-mountain, keeping it busy year round.A sharp incline awaits you as you depart the trailhead, threading you through a few winding switchbacks and well-beaten paths, but do not despair! The hike eventually levels out to reward you with some respite from the calf-burning first quarter mile. Two opportunities to get on the Boulder Garden Loop will occur at 0.3 and 0.5 miles, both of which can tack on extra mileage to the trip or transition you to the Mount Si route if you so desire, but for the Little Si summit proceed left on the main trail until you reach a section of canopied forest that straddles the bluff. As you continue through this temperate slice of woodlands, you will pass short tangential rock climbing paths, a prominent scree slope and a boulder field to the west before swooping around the slope at the 1.3 mile mark to make your final push toward the summit. Work your way up the last steep three quarters of a mile and you will reach your destination. While Little Si’s nub-like qualities suggest an underwhelming view awaits, you will be pleasantly surprised to find a peak that supplies phenomenal portraits of the valley and the surrounding peaks-Mount Si and Mount Washington can easily be viewed on a clear day-from your standing elevation of 1,550 feet. WTA Pro Tip: Very early on at 0.2 miles, make sure to duck off the trail to the southwest for a small ridge that provides a quick peek into the valley, a low elevation preview of what you can expect from the summit. If you’re short on time or are not quite in the shape you thought you were when you started in the parking lot, it can function as a nice compromise for a picnic spot to watch the sunset on the valley. Also, once you feel you have mastered the Little Si trail, seek out other North Bend staples such as Rattlesnake Ridge, Mount Si and Mailbox Peak (all located within a five mile drive of the Little Si trailhead).

The entry for the OLD trail can be found here: www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/mailbox-peak-old-trail/The old trail up Mailbox Peak was the stuff of legend. It inspired potential Rainier climbers, challenged adventurous day hikers, and occasionally Mother Nature used the trail to bite back. The number of injuries and rescues on the old trail, as well as terrible erosion caused by the masses of daily visitors, prompted the Department of Natural Resources to create a new trail to the top. While still relatively steep, this new route, built in part by WTA volunteers, offers a safer way for folks to attain the summit of this formidable peak. Your trip begins along the Middle Fork Road. The hike is wildly popular--on a typical weekend, the trailhead can have upward of 50 cars at any given hour. The new trail also came with a new upper parking lot, but even so, don't expect to get a spot in the parking lot unless you arrive very early. Hang your Discover Pass in your car and head out, walking for a short jaunt along a paved DNR road. Approach a gate and slip around it. About one hundred yards past the gate, an inviting opening indicates the location of the new trail. Set out for the summit here, along a trail that switchbacks along the northwest face of Mailbox Peak. Bridges and creek crossings await you in the lower section of the hike, and then the switchbacks start. At roughly 850 of elevation gain per mile, your thighs will feel the burn once you start climbing, and it won't let up until you're standing triumphantly next to the Mailbox. Distract yourself by taking a look at the construction of the trail. A multitude of WTA volunteer crews worked to create rock fords and turnpikes (elevated sections of trail) that keep your feet dry as you cross many creeks. The switchbacks continue for about 4 miles, before rejoining the old trail at elevation 3860 feet for your final push to the summit. This last push consists of 960 feet of elevation gain in half a mile--hopefully the approach warmed you up for the final assault! If your energy flags, remember what views await you at the summit. The peak's position at the end of a long ridgeline means you'll have an even better vantage point for panoramas than you might on other summits like Granite or Bandera. Rainier is in your face, and to the northwest, the Middle Fork Valley stretches before you like a lush green carpet. If nothing else, think about what might be in the mailbox itself besides the summit register. Folks have found beer, toys, even a fire hydrant at the top! What might you find? Let us know in the trip reports."

An easy trail with few ups and downs makes the hike suitable for a first-time overnight trip; a sparkling lake—one of the few hike-in lakes in northeast Washington—will coax weary backpackers onward.Beginning at Trout Lake, cross the outlet creek on a sturdy footbridge and begin switchbacking up through a forest of western redcedar. Moss-draped rocks and hollylike creeping Oregon-grape are reminiscent of Western Washington woods—the wetter east side of the Kettle Range contains many such pockets of surprisingly lush forest. The route quickly opens up to grassy slopes, out of which jut old-growth ponderosas and magnificent rock formations. In late spring, scan the slopes for shooting star, balsamroot and scarlet paintbrush. Reed-ringed Trout Lake lies below.In about 1.5 miles, pass through a dark birch forest. A slight switchbacking rise provides the last real climb of the hike in. In more than 2.5 miles, the trail forks. The way right continues on Hoodoo Trail, which crests the canyon with a falcon’s-eye view into Emerald Lake and its tiny neighbor Lily Lake—a worthy side excursion. For the lake itself, turn left, switchbacking 600 feet down to aptly named Emerald Lake. Linger for lunch or set up a tent in one of a handful of dispersed campsites. Watch for moose, which frequent the shallow lake. In dry years, the lake nearly disappears by late summer. However, early-summer hikers should pack a swimsuit; check the south end of the lake for the best swimming."

The mountain more than lives up to this otherworldly tale. To call Mount Si a popular trail is an understatement. It is hiked each year by upwards of 100,000 people. Its rugged beauty and its proximity to Seattle all but guarantee that the parking lot is overflowing on any nice (and many a not-so-nice) day. Gaining 3,100 feet in a little under four miles, it falls in a kind of sweet spot for experienced and novice hikers alike: enough of a test for bragging rights, not so tough as to scare people away. In early spring, climbers getting ready for Rainier come here with weighted packs. Conventional wisdom says if they can reach the end of the trail in under two hours, they’re ready to conquer the state’s tallest peak. Switchbacks and climbing begin almost as soon as you leave the trailhead. The trail ascends steadily, but gently, for its first mile and a half. Shortly thereafter, it flattens out as it winds through Snag Flat, a stand of old-growth trees that have survived both fire and logging. Many hikers rush through this section, but it’s worth taking a second to appreciate the immense size and age of the trees. It’s remarkable that they’re still standing. Prior to being established as a state conservation area in 1977, Mount Si was home to mining and logging; the trail on which you walk was once a 4x4 track. Most hikers overlook a tribute at the start of the trail to the person most responsible for protecting Mount Si –- pioneering state legislator Frances North. Beyond Snag Flat, the trail steepens, climbing more aggressively through younger forest. At three and a half miles, a brief break in the canopy provides your first real views to the south – look for it at a post that once held a more formal mile marker just before a hairpin turn. The trail resumes climbing and, a quarter of a mile or so later, pitches sharply upwards before reaching a talus slope that bisects the forest, providing expansive views to the southeast. On a clear day, Mount Rainier dominates the horizon. This is the turnaround (and lunch spot) for most hikers, a fact not lost on the gray jays, chipmunks and occasional Douglas squirrel that have learned to beg for handouts. As cute as they are, it's not recommended to feed these animals. The trail does not end at the lunch spot, though –- look towards the right for stone steps cemented into the rock. It winds up and over the rocks, then back into a brief stretch of forest, before branching off to the left to an overlook of the Snoqualmie Valley, Seattle, and the Olympics. You can also gaze up at the Haystack, Mount Si’s true summit, as well as the lower western summit. Keep an eye out for mountain goats – they’re frequent summer visitors to the rocky slopes below the western ridge. For the vertically inclined, a rough scramble leads to the top of the Haystack from the other branch of the formal trail. It’s easy to think of Si as merely a very popular trail, but it provides a touch of wilderness in less than a 45-minute drive from Seattle. While most people today might not view it as a folk hero fallen to earth, they do see it as an introduction to the natural wonders of the Cascades. That is what makes this trail truly special."

There will also be plenty of wildflowers to please photographers and hiking plant nerds alike.There is something to see every step of the way on this hike; the views start as soon as you open your car door at the trailhead. The trail takes off from the parking lot past a cute little A-frame outhouse, then traverses along the base of the mountain before starting a series of switchbacks upward across the meadow. The way is steep and narrow, and in some places eroded from hikers cutting the switchbacks. Please don’t, the switchbacks are there to prevent erosion and environmental damage to the trail. As you hike, the views get even better, so go ahead, stop for a breather, and take a few pictures. The trail is south-facing and exposed to the sun, so be sure to take plenty of breaks and enjoy your view. Notice too, that the flower species changing as you climb. Leave the oxeye daisy (a non-native) and native thistles behind as you climb through fireweed, cow parsnip and valerian. Soon, purple penstemon, paintbrush and pearly everlasting line the trail. Look for the lacy leaves and flowers of Western meadowrue. Did you know the male and female flowers are on different plants? The male plants have flowers with long showy stamens hanging down. You may pass by a dark purple-black small daisylike flower and wonder what it is. It goes by the name sawwort (Saussurea). Later in the season look for purple asters, Scottish bluebell and yarrow.                                                                                                                              Climb higher and rest in the shade of small groves of subalpine fir and hemlock at the edge of the switchbacks. Listen for marmots and watch for their holes. Mount Baker will be peeking out from behind the ridge, and the Skagit and Sauk river valleys will be below. On a clear day, you can see the water of Puget Sound. In just over a mile the trail crosses a small saddle in the ridgeline and heads north. Look for Glacier Peak and the mountains of the North Cascades spread before you! Early in the season, the snow may start here. If it has just melted, notice the glacier lilies and spring beauty left in its wake. Circle around the north side and there will be an intersecting trail to the right leading downhill. This leads to Sauk Lake, losing more elevation than you gained from the parking lot.  There will be little trails leading over the ridge to viewpoints, but stay on the main trail, as you want the Big Picture at the top.Swing around the hill and come to a flat spot by a nice grove of trees. Look over the edge and see Sauk Lake. From here the trail to the top will be visible below the rock pinnacles. Early in the season, this section of the trail may be covered with snowfields. Cross carefully, or enjoy your lunch from the trees and save the rest for later. If the snow is gone, follow the trail through the rocks. Notice the small alpine flowers, saxifrage, potentilla, thyme buckwheat and yellow coralbells. Clinging to the rocks is a large shrubby grey-leafed plant with odd looking creamy flower clusters called silverback luina. The trail can be a little hard to follow at the top, but look for worn tread in a saddle between the rocks, cross over and make your way to the lookout site at the top. Soak in the views and try to name all the peaks, a sea of peaks, near and far. The Pickets are obvious, as is Whitehorse Mountain near Darrington, Glacier Peak and over to the south, Rainier. You may see Mount Constitution on Orcas Island. There once was a fire lookout here and you can still see some debris from it at the summit. On a nice sunny weekend it can get crowded up here, so eat your lunch, take your pictures and head down so someone else can enjoy it.WTA Pro-Tip: Use the National Geographic North Cascades National Park map for peak identification from the summit; it covers more of this territory than Green Trails."

If you feel like pressing on, Ollalie Lake is just about a mile and a half up trail, where open campsites offer lakeside havens with calm waters and views of a beautiful lake basin. From the Talapus parking area, head into dark, cool forest on a wide, if somewhat rooty trail. The grade is moderate, allowing you to enjoy the tall cedars and hemlocks all around you. The trail steepens soon, switchbacking up as Talapus Creek flows downhill to your right. While the trail is wide, watch where you step. Roots can be very slippery, especially when wet. Be on the lookout for a great photo opportunity at a sharp switchback about 1.3 miles in, where Talapus Creek foams into a ravine just off the trail. From this point the trail flattens out, heading straight through increasingly boggy terrain – be ready to get your boots wet! Just before crossing Talapus Creek, a fork greets hikers. Though the left path is still somewhat evident, branches and foliage lying across the trail indicate that this is not the way to go. Please don’t take this path. Your route to the lake is across the creek, over the footlog and through a bit more mud. WTA crews have worked here installing a turnpike, a structure that helps keep hikers’ feet out of the muddiest areas, just before the lake. Crest a small rise and shortly arrive at Talapus Lake. Break out a snack, or lunch if this is your final destination. If you’re pressing onto Ollalie Lake, stay on the trail at Talapus and switchback up the hillside through forest.  0.7 miles after leaving Talapus you’ll arrive at a junction. Crossing Talapus Creek via the right-hand path will put you on the Pratt Lake Trail after 0.2 miles, but Ollalie Lake is attained via the left-hand path. Hike a slightly steeper grade for about 0.3 miles. Shortly after climbing, the trail levels out and Ollalie Lake appears to your right. The trail stays high on the valley wall, but looking downhill you will see the campsites that dot the lake’s western shore. Head down to an unclaimed one and pitch camp, then relax in  the shade of the trees and splash in the lake. WTA Pro-Tip: The popularity of these lakes has made wildlife in this area particularly used to humans. Respect the principles of Leave No Trace by not feeding the gray jays (also known, appropriately, as camp robbers) and the chipmunks."

The trail to Lost and Manastash Lakes is an underappreciated gem that will delight larch lovers, berry munchers, flower photographers, and campers alike.Manastash Ridge is a gently rolling basalt plateau, running for 50 miles in an east-west direction between Ellensburg and Yakima, notable for cliffs and talus slopes at its perimeter, with elevation varying from 3800 to 6300 feet.

Before reaching Manastash Lake’s basin at 5063 feet, descend briefly, then climb back up to a saddle: Manastash Lake is suddenly before you, clam and reflective. Hardhack, aster, fireweed, and buttercup bloom near the lake.

Heard of Lynwood or Mountlake Terrace? These suburbs of the big city have the trolley line to thank for their existence.

Its last run was on February 20, and now the only remaining trolley from this era can be seen at Heritage Park in Lynwood, just off its former route.

Here a registration kiosk and general park information awaits. It's a good idea to sign in; this is a primitive route. Signage is sparse and the trail itself can be hard to find in places. From the National Park boundary to the junction with the Bogachiel River Trail, it is 6.3 miles with 800 feet of elevation gain -- a lovely forest walk, though the way may be faint. 2.8 miles from the northern trailhead, arrive at a crossing of the Calawah River.

A few years ago, both ends of the trail were obliterated by clear-cut logging and the trail was unusable for some time. The ends of the trail have been relocated to avoid the logged-over areas and the trail is usable once again, now as a joint-use trail for hikers and mountain bikers. If you hiked this trail several years ago, or are consulting an older map or hiking guide, you need to be aware there have been significant changes.As one of Tiger Mountain's ""internal"" trails, the Silent Swamp Trail lacks a publically accessible trailhead of its own, so it can be hiked only in combination with other Tiger trails. One such combination, most likely the easiest, is offered here.Begin at the Tiger Summit Trailhead off Highway 18 and take the short Connector Trail heading east. It soon crosses the Main Tiger Mountain Road (Rd 4000,) and then becomes the NW Timber Trail. Enjoy the surroundings here that are exceptionally green and mossy, and in spring be alert for a few wildflowers.Soon, you will come to a trail junction. This could be confusing because it's not shown on the current (2014) revision of the Green Trails Tiger Mountain Map. Your route is the right fork, the ongoing NW Timber Trail (although in the spring of 2016 the trail sign was reported missing.) The left trail fork, signed ""Master Link Trail,"" is one of several new trails constructed in this corner of the Tigers for joint use by hikers and mountain bikers. Some of these new trails are not shown on the 2014 revision of the Green Trails map, but likely will appear on future editions. In the interim, you can find all the new trails on a map downloadable from Evergreen Mountain Bike Alliance, https://www.evergreenmtb.org.As you continue on the NW Timber Trail, it enters an area that was logged a few years ago, so it is sunnier and dryer. Look for a different mix of spring wildflowers here. Soon, you will come to a signed junction with the Joy Ride Trail (shown on the 2014 revision of the Green Trails map.) Head up that trail. It's a bit more rambling and undulating than a trail constructed just for hikers would be, but it's not at all problematical. As on any trail shared with mountain bikers, it's a good idea to be alert for an occasional rider heading downhill toward you. If you encounter anyone, please step off the trail and let them pass, and do offer friendly greetings.Continue on about a mile on the Joy Ride Trail, gaining 350 feet, then cross Trout Hatchery Creek on a sturdy bridge. In a few yards you will come to a signed trail fork. Heading uphill to the left is the Fully Rigid Trail. Heading slightly downhill to the right is the new upper end of the Silent Swamp Trail (formerly located higher up on the Crossover Road.)Head down the Silent Swamp Trail. There are a few steep, stony switchbacks at the beginning before the grade becomes more steady. Much of the route is very green, with a lot of growth in the understory, and many gigantic, decaying stumps - remnants of logging a century ago. In fact, this trail may offer the most dramatic and colorful old stumpage you can see anywhere in the Tigers. The new Silent Swamp Trail continues on for about 1.5 miles, avoiding recently-logged areas. In fact, much of it sports significant second growth forest. A short section of the trail, perhaps a hundred yards or so, follows a newly-constructed boardwalk. That area may not strike you as particularly swampy, although after a rain there will be small rivulets and trickles.You can judge for yourself whether the word ""Swamp"" in the trail name is appropriate. The area certainly is mossy. If you have hiked the Big Tree Trail - or the Tradition Lake Loop - up in the northwest corner of the Tigers then you know what real swamp looks like. But, aptly-named or not, the Silent Swamp Trail does offer a very satisfying hike through a dramatic, very green area.At its lower end, the Silent Swamp Trail ends at the Crossover Road (Rd 5500). Continue downhill on the road 0.2 miles, passing the lower end of the Preston RR Grade Trail, and continue a short way beyond that to reach the East Side Road. Turn right, and head south along that road for the next 1.8 miles. As with most roads in the Tigers, this road is intended for occasional use by authorized service vehicles. It's closed to the general public, so you are unlikely to see much motorized traffic.Part way along the road, in the spring of 2016, there was a washout that closed the road to motor vehicles. The remaining road bed is several feet wide, enough to accommodate hikers and bikers safely. But washouts can evolve in response to heavy rain so, if the washout has not yet been repaired, look the situation over carefully before deciding how to proceed.When you reach the well-signed junction with the NW Timber Trail, turn onto that trail. In 0.2 miles, you will come to the familiar junction with the Joy Ride Trail where you headed uphill earlier in your hike. Follow the NW Timber Trail, and the short Connector Trail, back to your trailhead.Alternative RoutesIf you are enthused about the Silent Swamp Trail and would like to experience it again, you do have the option of turning around when you reach the Crossover Road and retracing your incoming route back to the trailhead.Alternatively, a look at the map will suggest other possibilities for a loop that includes the Silent Swamp Trail, although most will involve greater distance and more elevation change than the loop route suggested above.For example, upon reaching the lower end of the Silent Swamp Trail, you could turn left and hike up the Crossover Road about two miles, gaining about 400 feet, to reach the upper end of the Fully Rigid Trail, then descend that trail and the Joy Ride Trail back to the NW Timber Trail.If you do opt for an alternative return route, be sure it avoids the Predator Trail. That trail descends steeply from Sally's Summit on East Tiger Mountain to reach the Tiger Summit Trailhead and unlike other trails in the area it is designated for use by mountain bikers only."

Its translucent depths, tucked underneath the uppermost 2,000 feet of Chair Peak, are removed from the highway crossing Snoqualmie Pass by just a short trail with minimal elevation gain. Elitists need not apply – Snow Lake is the most visited lake in the Alpine Lakes Wilderness…and rightly so.The trail departs from the north end of the main parking lot of the Alpental Ski Area, which on any given Saturday or Sunday will fill to capacity. Go early or prepare to be friendly! After an initial 200-foot climb up log steps, the trail settles down for a gradual ascent in forest. A mile in, a talus slope offers a break in the trees and views of a landscape that has suddenly grown exponentially more rugged than the parking lot you just left. In the distance, Chair Peak stands tall at the end of a jagged ridge rising over the far side of the valley.In another three quarters of a mile, the trail switchbacks to the right – it’s time to start the mercifully short climb. Over the next two thirds of a mile, the trail weaves its way 500 feet up to the wilderness boundary at a saddle above Snow Lake. Here you get your first view of your objective. From this angle, it looks unassuming enough – its far shore is mostly rolling hills; but the first rule of Snow Lake is to never settle for the early view. It gets better – much better. Half a mile from the saddle--and a 400-foot drop in elevation you’ll have to regain on the way back out--the trail reaches an inlet to the lake. Here, a short side trail leads down to the shore, passing the remains of an old cabin, a relic of a time when this part of the shore was private land. Marvel for a moment that Snow Lake was once someone’s front yard, then wander down to the lakeside to enjoy the prior owner’s daily view. And a nice view it is, of Roosevelt Peak standing out at the head of the lake. Unbeknownst to the many who call it a day here, more spectacular terrain lies just out of sight beyond the shoulder of Chair Peak. Rejoin the trail, cross the inlet, and continue another half of a mile to where the lake’s outlet drains to the Middle Fork Snoqualmie Valley. Along the way, peer deep into the clear, cold water. The depths of the lake are almost as impressive as the ramparts of the neighboring mountains soaring above you.Just after crossing the outlet, the trail proceeds down to the lakeshore. From here, the full majesty of Chair Peak is coaxed from hiding. Sheer cliffs, crowned by polished rock rise from the distant shore. From the mountain’s heights, waterfalls snake their way down to sheltered coves often striped by ribbons of snow until well into July--the lake’s name is no accident. If you can tear yourself away, you will quickly reach the end of the trail, which is no end at all but rather an intersection with two other trails. One leads a long way down to the Middle Fork Snoqualmie Valley, the upper reaches of which are visible in the distance. The other leads to yet more mountain lakes. While there may be yet more views to be had, you can safely turn around here, secure in the knowledge that the reward for the effort will be no greater than what you have already attained. That is the true beauty of Snow Lake--how readily it shares the splendor of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness.WTA Pro Tip: At 1.75 miles, where the trail begins to switchback upwards, a spur trail offers a brief side trip up the valley to an overlook of Source Lake, the headwaters of the Snoqualmie River’s south fork."

Be alert for spring wildflowers or, seasonally, fall colors. Listen for many bird calls. Enjoy views across Goodhope Pond, a small lake that often hosts waterfowl.Because there are no trail signs in Pine Ridge Park a map is essential, even to follow the hike description below. You can download one from www.edmondswa.gov. It does require a few clicks: In the header, click Services / Parks and Recreation. In the left column, click Visit a Park / Visit a Park (yes, it appears twice.) In the right column click Pine Ridge Park. Scroll down and click the link above the small map (not the link below the Google map.) While the map may show some surrounding streets closer than they actually are, the trail layout is depicted accurately. As in any park, there are a few social trails not shown on the map. Please try to stay on the official trails.If you prefer, you can set out with the map and explore on your own. Or, here is a suggested route that gets to the most interesting parts of the park.From the east edge of the parking area, take the nearly-level Upper Trail and head south. In less than a quarter mile note a sitting bench on the right side of the trail. Immediately past the bench turn right, steeply downhill, on the Pond View Trail. It levels out after just a few feet, heads south toward Goodhope Pond, and ends at the water's edge. (Note some sources spell the name ""Good Hope Pond."") The shoreline here is heavily overgrown so the view of the pond is somewhat restricted. With luck, you will be able to see a few ducks out on the water. (You will have a more expansive view of the pond from the western shore.)Return to the Upper Trail and head back north the way you came. In about 500 feet note a trail on the left, shown on the map as the Nature Path. Take that trail as it drops a few feet, then levels out and approaches a small pond that is immediately upstream of Goodhope Pond. You may see more ducks here. Then continue on the Nature Path and, in just a few feet, reach the Main Trail. Turn left here and proceed south.In about 700 feet you will come to a more open section of shoreline, next to a bench. This offers your best view of Goodhope Pond. Enjoy it for a few minutes. It's likely some waterfowl will appear for you including, in the spring, some young birds. And it's certain you will hear the calls of redwing blackbirds perched in nearby cattails.Continue farther south on the Main Trail and, in about 200 feet, come to Cole's Cutoff where you'll turn right (Unless you are doing the optional hike extension to Yost Park, as suggested below. In that case, continue south on the Main Trail.) After your right turn, climb a minor hill and reach a trail junction. The left branch leads out to 85th Pl W. Take the right branch, it's the Serenity Trail.In the spring of 2016, a number of small blowdowns were noted at this end of the Serenity Trail, evidence things are not always so serene here. The downed trees have been sawed up and moved off the trail. As you continue north on the Serenity Trail, be alert for the taps of woodpeckers and the calls of crows, jays and other birds. The trail drops gradually, eventually merging with the Main Trail within sight of the parking area.As minor continuations of your hike, consult the map and check out the nearby Cedar Crest Trail and (at your own risk!) the Dead End Path. There also are short spur trails that lead out to neighborhood streets. For a more ambitious hike extension, see below.Extending your hikeIf Pine Ridge Park hasn't satisfied all your hiking ambitions, Yost Park is only a half-mile away. You can easily hike over to Yost Park, enjoy some trails there (see our Hiking Guide entry for Yost Park) then return here. To get to Yost Park from Pine Ridge Park, continue south along the Main Trail beyond Cole's Cutoff. The trail bends around west, approaches Main Street, then passes under Main Street via a tunnel/culvert. (As you approach the southern end of the tunnel the floor rises. Are you over six feet tall? If so, WATCH YOUR HEAD.)Beyond the tunnel, a wide, paved trail continues on south about 400 feet where it meets the dead end of Pioneer Way. This is an area of suburban homes with a lot of green landscaping. It also has quiet streets with little traffic, so it's generally a pleasant walk. Continue along Pioneer Way to Shell Valley Rd and turn right. Continue straight ahead on Shell Valley Rd and enter Yost Park along a gated park service road. Follow the road until it passes the back of the swimming pool, and find the trailhead for the Sword Fern Trail on your right. Refer to our Hiking Guide, and a Yost Park map, for additional information."

Begin in the eastern section of this Bellevue park and hike a series of trails for a satisfying loop through dark second-growth forest. Then, follow a connecting trail over to the western section of the park for a loop though the Bellevue Botanical Garden - both the formal gardens and some additional longer forest trails. Along the way brave a high, narrow trail bridge that crosses a deep ravine. Not enough? Multiple spur trails throughout the park invite further exploration.The park is named for the logging town of Wilburton that thrived here around 1900. Nothing remains of that town today, and the area has become a park where healthy second-growth forest can be appreciated. For your hike, it will be helpful to download a map of park trails fromparkstrails.myparksandrecreation.com/Details.aspx?pid=477Click on ""Detailed Map of Wilburton Hill Park Trails"" (Not on Map/Directions)If you prefer, you can set out with the map in hand and explore on your own. Or, here is a suggested route that gets to the most interesting parts of the park, and offers some ideas for hike extensions.Begin at the northeast corner of the parking lot. For your first loop (about 1.5 miles,) head east on the obvious wide trail past the restrooms. At the trail sign, turn left on the trail that climbs a few feet before circling part way around the baseball field. Soon, your route plunges into darker forest, and you will be surrounded by tall deciduous trees mixed with a number of tall second-growth Douglas firs.Frequent signed spur trails lead out to neighborhood side streets - you can pass them by or can explore them, as you like. On the main trail you will come to an unsigned Y. The better option here is to stay left. As you continue on the main trail you will pass additional optional side trails. Eventually, looming up ahead, you will see an odd, red geometric structure. It's part of a playground located near the southern end of the parking lot, and you will complete your first loop there.From the parking area, an optional side trail heads 0.3 miles south, initially following a power line. Explore it if you like, although you'll have to come back the same way. The trail drops a bit, bridges a small creek (often, just a trickle) and ends at a T-junction. The arms of the T lead out (east) to a school or (west) to Lake Hills Connector, a busy city street. The route is forested all the way, and can be a pleasant addition to your hike if you have the time and inclination.Back at the parking area, head west on the gravel trail that passes around the southern edge of the soccer field. (The field itself offers a striking visual contrast. It's all artificial, of course, both the bright green ""turf"" and the bordering red jogging path.) A few feet beyond the soccer field a small pond is visible off the trail on the right, and you might see some ducks there. The trail continues on about 0.4 miles and soon reaches the parking area for the Bellevue Botanical Garden. Turn left on the wide concrete sidewalk that heads directly toward the Visitor Center and main garden entrance. Admission is free, but note that if you're traveling with a dog, you'll have to save this for another day -- pups are not allowed in the botanic garden.A detailed map of the formal part of the Botanical Garden is available at the Visitor Center, and copies often can be picked up on an outdoor table near the southern edge of the center.Near the Visitor Center, you will begin the second loop (about a mile) of your hike. Head south on the pathway bordered by white railings. Turn right at the first opportunity and meander past a large bronze toad christened ""Goldiwarts,"" who quietly solicits (optional) donations via a slot in a sculpted log. Smile, and continue on through the Rock Garden (an exhibit of plants that do well in rocky habitats) and the Waterwise Garden (an exhibit of plants that do well with little watering.) Then, pass the Short House (donated by the Short family, who resided and farmed here in the 1950s.) Head southwest down the stairs and come to a wide trail that heads southeast. At a Y, take a hard right turn where the sign indicates ""Ravine Experience - Lost Meadow Trail."" The Lost Meadow turns out to be a rather small grassy area. Continue on and pass a signed service road and, a few feet beyond that, turn right on the unsigned but obvious trail heading downhill. This leads, surprisingly, to a high cable bridge that carries the trail across a deep ravine. As you walk across, the bridge responds with slight bounces that enhance the already-airy feeling. Appreciate this high perspective on the forest and land forms.Once across the bridge, turn right. Farther along, next to a Stellers Jay sign, turn left. Along the way, be alert for any gnomes as this short loop leads you back to the bridge.Cross back over the bridge, turn right and then, at the gravel trail, turn right again. Soon, the Native Plant Garden appears on your left and, shortly after that, the Yao Garden on your right. Both are well worth a leisurely walk-through or a short contemplative rest on a bench. Then, the trail continues on past the Rhododendron Garden, in the spring offering an exuberant flourish of diverse colors. And, beyond that, you return to the Visitor Center, completing your second loop. From there, you can return to the parking area via the connecting trail.While you are in the formal part of the garden, you will note many plants are numbered, and there are frequent pads you can tap or scan with a smartphone for more information. Additionally, along the forest trails be alert in early spring for trilliums, and later in the spring for buttercups, fringe cup, avens, wild berries and salal. It's likely you will hear many bird calls, and see a few squirrels. Also, it is not unusual to see a few small rabbits here, although they may not be native to the park."

You can download one from www.edmondswa.gov/yost-park-discovery.html. This same page offers an interesting history of the early days of Edmonds, and of early logging here.One trail shown on the map, the Songbird Trail just west of the parking area, seems not to exist (as of Spring 2016.) Also, as in any park, there are a few social trails not shown on the map. Please try to stay on the official trails.For a small park, the network of trails is surprisingly intricate. If you prefer, you can set out with the map and explore on your own. Or, here is a suggested route that gets to the most interesting parts of the park.From the NW end of the parking area, follow the gated park service road as it curves around to the right and heads toward the back of the pool. Be alert for the ""Trail"" sign on the left that marks the beginning of the Sword Fern Trail. Descend that trail steeply into the ravine, and reach a pair of bridges over Shell Creek. Note remnants of old concrete structures here, and elsewhere along the creek. They date from 1902 when the park's namesake, the Yost family, formed the Edmonds Spring Water Company to provide the first regular water service to Edmonds.At the creek, take the right trail fork (it's the Shell Creek Trail,) cross the bridge and follow the trail upstream. It's a good trail, partly on boardwalk. In spring, be alert for a few wildflowers such as buttercups, youth-on-age, avens, fringe cup and bleeding heart. Wild berries are found here too. Look for the early magenta blooms of salmonberry and later, the white blooms of thimbleberry and creeping raspberry. And, particularly in spring, listen for an ongoing medley of bird songs.Continue along Shell Creek Trail. It crosses the main stream twice and some minor tributaries as well on sturdy bridges. At a trail fork stay left (the right fork returns to the parking area.) Cross Shell Creek again on a bridge and turn right at the next trail crossing. At the next fork stay right and cross the creek again. Just before another bridge across Shell Creek, near the park boundary, note the Overlook Trail heading right and uphill.Take this trail, cross the park service road and climb steeply uphill. In May, near the hilltop, you are likely to see orange honeysuckle in bloom. At the top of the hill go straight. Drop slightly and, in about 100 feet, turn right onto the Crow's Nest Loop. In spite of the name, there is no view. Follow the trail a short way downhill and be alert for a trail on the left. Take it (the ongoing route ends near the tennis courts.) Soon, at a trail junction, head left again (the right fork also ends near the tennis courts.) Head back uphill and, at the now-familiar high point, go right on the Overlook Trail.Descend the Overlook Trail back to Shell Creek, cross the bridge near the edge of the park, and head gently uphill. The ongoing route can be somewhat confusing, because there are social trails as well as official trails along the way and, of course, there are no signs. It's likely you can refer to the map and follow the route along parts of the Cedar Loop Trail and the Highline Trail on your own. Or, refer to the following hints. (As a backup, any downhill trail will return you to the Shell Creek Trail.)At each of the next four trail junctions, stay right. After the last junction, you will be heading steeply uphill. Be alert for the trail that sweeps around to the left and take it. In a few feet go left again, then in a few more feet go right. At a trail crossing go straight. At a T-junction, go right on the Highline Trail. At the next trail fork, stay right. At the next T-junction, go left (the right fork leads out to a trailhead on Main St, opposite Olympic Ave.) This puts you back on the Sword Fern Trail, near its northern end.The route is easier now. Soon, look for a ""Trail"" sign pointing right. This is somewhat misleading, because it directs you to the Weir Trail that is a dead end. But do go there. The Weir Trail drops a bit and soon reaches Shell Creek at the site of another concrete structure. There are good views across the creek, and it's worth scanning the trees across the stream for pileated woodpeckers or eagles. When you are ready, head back up the Weir Trail to the Sword Fern Trail and turn right. Drop a few feet, and soon come to the dual bridges across Shell Creek that should look familiar. Continue straight ahead on the Sword Fern Trail to return to your trailhead at the parking area.Extending your hikeIf Yost Park hasn't satisfied all your hiking ambitions, Pine Ridge Park is only a half-mile away. You can easily hike over to Pine Ridge Park, enjoy some trails there (see our Hiking Guide entry for Pine Ridge Park) then return here. To get from Yost Park to Pine Ridge Park by foot, follow the park service road as it circles around behind the pool and heads toward the eastern park boundary. Continue straight ahead on Shell Valley Road. This is an area of suburban homes with a lot of green landscaping. It also has quiet streets with little traffic so it's generally a pleasant walk. In about 1000 feet, turn left on Pioneer Way. The street soon comes to a dead end, but a wide paved trail continues on. In another 400 feet it reaches Main Street, where it passes under the street via a tunnel/culvert. (Are you over six feet tall? If so, WATCH YOUR HEAD.) Beyond the tunnel, the trail enters a narrow extension of Pine Ridge Park, and you will find yourself on that park's Main Trail headed toward Cole's Cutoff.

Grasslands, basalt cliffs, and scrub oak forests form the hillsides on both sides of the mighty Columbia river. This hike climbs steadily with ever increasing views. The first mile or so of this Nature Conservancy administered trail climbs moderately. At times it follows an old wagon trail and at times it turns to single track that works it's way up the ridge line. After a bit the trail gets a little more serious as it steepens and directly follows the south trending ridge line. In a few spots the trail almost runs directly on top of a significant cliff towards the east.The open grasslands are full of arrowleaf balsamroot, bachelor's button, and other fantastic flowers. Scrub oak groves are interspersed along to the way to provide some welcome shade. Notice how the oaks are almost reduced to krummholz (trees stunted by wind, usually found in alpine areas) near the top of the hike from the incessant winds. Spring may be the best time of year for this hike as the summers can be quite hot, and shade is sparse. The summit of McCall Point is rounded and grassy with 270 degree views. A trail is easily visible heading through the saddle south of the summit for those who want to explore further.

One story holds that Harvey Manning -- angry that logging in the lower Eagle Creek basin made road access to Eagle Lake via the Fisherman's route too easy -- intentionally omitted directions to this trailhead in his guidebook. The roadside parking area is marked with a “National Forest Wilderness” sign that bears a map of the region. The sign erroneously indicates “Barclay Lake #1055,” but knowledgeable hikers have indicated the location of the trailhead and the trail route with black marker. If you see this wrong sign, then you are in the right place! Head northwest into the brush that lines the trail, which starts over rocky tread. Pass through the alder-dominated brush into second-growth forest and finally into old growth forest, populated by western red cedar, subalpine fir, western hemlock, and mountain hemlock. The trail starts off rocky but then becomes rooty as it enters the Wild Sky Wilderness. The high rainfall in the wilderness helps sustain moss, maidenhair ferns, and deer ferns. To your right, peek through the trees for glimpses of Townsend Mountain, towering over you. Munch on huckleberries if you hike during the late summer or fall.Over 1.9 miles the rugged trail gains 600 feet to a maximum height of 4000 feet, then descends slightly and comes to a circular clearing. The trail to the left heads to Stone Lake and ultimately down to Barclay Lake, while the trail to the right leads into Paradise Meadow and continues northwest for 0.6 miles through a wetland crisscrossed by creek channels and dominated by heather and huckleberry bushes. Stick to the best-defined bootpaths to minimize your environmental footprint. You may have to jump over a few creeks along the way. Boots, a map, and a compass are a must to ensure that you reach your destination with dry feet.As you approach Eagle Lake, Merchant Peak looms overhead to your west. Townsend Mountain is to the northeast. Watch for chipmunks, coastal tailed frogs, grasshoppers, dragonflies, and trout that live in and around the lake and Paradise Meadow. Lakeside flora include mountain ash, mountain hemlocks, and paintbrush. Follow the paths to explore the cabin on the southeast shore of the lake. Keep in mind that this area has been heavily impacted by hikers visiting it. Please stay on the social trails, even if they're muddy -- it's easy to wash off your boots when you get home; meadows take much longer to recover."

For many, this is a gateway to other trails that lead on to more distant goals, such as the Adventure Trail (to the west end of Tradition Plateau,) the Poo Poo Point Trail (it gets to the point, of course) and the Section Line Trail (toward the higher Tiger summits.)Your hike can begin from either of two trailheads near Issaquah High School.If you are beginning at the northern trailhead at the end of SE Evans St (see Driving Directions) head south on the obvious trail (signed ""Trail""). Avoid any side trails that head left into the forest. Just continue on south, pass the tennis courts and follow along a small power line. Soon, you will note a sign on the left up ahead, placed there by the Issaquah Alps Trail Club, proclaiming ""High School Trail.""If, instead, you are beginning at the southern trailhead along 2nd Ave SE, just north of Front St, then head east on the obvious unsigned trail that leaves the parking area. Pass by some back yards and the soccer fields, and soon come to the same ""High School Trail"" sign that's encountered by folks coming from the northern trailhead.Where the sign indicates you should turn, drop a few feet then hike a gentle arc to the left. In about a hundred feet reach an old road bed and turn sharply right, heading uphill.You will pass an old metal gate that for many years was closed and had to be detoured around. Now (2016), it seems to be open all the time. About 400 feet beyond the gate, look downslope to the right of the trail and note an old metal bathtub, now partly filled with gravel. What its original purpose might have been no one today seems to know.Farther along, come to a sign board with cautions about bears (yes they're out here, but rarely seen) and on the other side of the board you'll find a Green Trails map showing many Tiger Mountain trails.

It comes from the direction of tiny Round Lake, and seems to run all year even in dry years.Shortly, you will find yourself beneath a major power line with a signpost located just a few feet to your left. The signpost marks the official upper end of the High School Trail, although the Poo Poo Point and Section Line Trails continue on from there. You can return the way you came, or can continue on one of the ongoing trails if that's your plan for the day.While the High School Trail is not really a wildflower hike, in spring it's likely you will see buttercups, salmon berry, thimble berry, avens, salal, white daisies, and sometimes even an odd trillium although they are more common higher up in the Tigers. A few low honeysuckle vines do grow along the High School Trail, but sightings of the small bright-orange trumpet blooms seem to be fairly rare (be alert if you are hiking in May.) Also, you are likely to see a few squirrels, and there have been reports of occasional deer sightings. You will hear many bird calls, although some birds will manage to remain out of sight."

There is no toilet. There is no sign board. For modernity you will have to go to the campground. The trail system is small and simple; the perimeter is a 1.5 mile loop with a few spokes connecting the center. All the trails are reasonably-sized, maintain easy grades, and are fairly obvious, although a map wouldn't be a bad idea (see map section below for a printable map). The northwestern half of the park contains the largest trees, so if you're here for neck-craning admiration try the Oxalis Loop or Woodpecker-Deer Trail Loop.

So why not see something you might not expect - a clearcut.Starting at the trailhead, walk west along the grassy path within earshot of the highway. A sign may mark this as the Deer Trail. After a few curves in the trail you'll pass under the suspended canopy of enormous trees that draws your gaze upward and enforces a new posture while lulling your senses into slower motion.

The Snoqualmie Tribe consider the falls to be humanity’s place of origin, and the crushing waters have provided energy to a hydroelectric plant since 1898. Today, the Snoqualmie River’s 268-foot drop generates electricity for Puget Sound Energy, which manages the site. In the early 90s, Snoqualmie Falls became a cult icon when it featured prominently in the credit sequence to David Lynch's television series ""Twin Peaks"". The success of the show turned the falls into a local landmark that draws 1.5 million visitors per year.Though you may be tempted to get closer to the famed falls, please don’t climb over the gate or railings to the river below, as the surfaces are often slippery, and river levels may change unpredictably.WTA Pro Tip: After your hike, continue east on SR-202 for 1 mile for a visit to historic Snoqualmie, with its boutique shops, small restaurants, and train museum."

Despite the roar of a distant creek, the slope is dry, as evidenced by the few madronas and manzanita bushes.At 1 mile and after 1000 feet of climbing, a bench with a view of Lake Cushman invites a break. Catch your breath and continue. After 0.1 mile enter the Mount Skokomish Wilderness. Ironically, the trees are now smaller and less impressive. Perhaps it's due to thinner soils, for the way gets even steeper. At 1.6 miles enter a cool forest of hemlock. A short spur trail leads left to a little cascade, although it may be dry by late summer.In another 0.25 mile reach the summit loop junction (elev. 3050 ft) along with a small plaque honoring the crew that built this trail. Take the left trail-it's shorter and steeper, leaving the longer and more gradual option for the descent, relieving your knees.The summit loop climbs 1,300 feet in just over 1 mile, through recently burned forest and remnant pockets of old-growth. At 2.9 miles from the trailhead reach the 4,301-foot forested summit. Don't despair, a small vertigo-inducing rock outcropping juts out of the forest providing a panoramic payoff. Directly below, waters sparkling, is Lake Cushman. Lightning Peak and Timber Mountain rise majestically behind it. Wonder Mountain and Church Peak are just off to the right. The Skokomish delta, Black and Willapa Hills, and Mount Rainier are all visible from this pulse-raising promontory. Through silver snags and white pines the deep valley of the North Fork Skokomish can also be glimpsed.After your rosy outlook continue on the loop. Along a forested ledge, the trail makes a 1.7-mile saner return to the loop junction.

This is a lovely lakeside jaunt for families or those wishing to stretch their legs on a long drive. The four-mile trail winds along the shores of nine-mile long Lake Crescent, whose character changes with the weather, but always provides an excellent backdrop to a hike year-round. The hike begins in an old orchard, chock-full of maple trees dripping with moss. Amble through the orchard, then drop down to a path that follows an old railroad. This was once a railroad used to haul Sitka spruce trees out of the depths of the forest, hence the hike’s name. Originally intended to  manufacture aircraft in World War I, the logs wound up serving commercial logging interests for nearly forty years. When demand petered out, the National Park Service utilized the natural beauty of the area and turned four miles of the railroad bed into scenic trail. And scenic it is. Winding through sunlight dappled corridors of maple, Sitka spruce, hemlock and countless other types of trees, with the lake lapping nearby, there is something to delight the senses every step of the way. Beach access is possible at several points, though occasionally hikers find themselves high above the lake, peering down nearly 40 feet into its crystalline blue waters. The main attraction of the hike comes only one mile in. A large bridge spans a section of lake and to the right is a gorgeous, still pool--the Punchbowl. Photo opportunities abound here, so take some time to snap a few shots, then proceed on. 2.5 miles from the Punchbowl, there are nice views of Barnes Point and Mount Storm King looming above the lake.

Follow the wide pathway along a south-facing traverse, first through open forests of pines and low shrubs. The way eventually opens up to a moderately graded traverse. The way is quite easy to navigate, since the trail is wide. It consists of three generous switchbacks to a summit complete with interpretive signs pointing out the visible peaks and towns, as well as the various burns that have come through this area. Just before the first switchback, encounter a trenched trail (which is signed ‘Elwha 6 mi’) heading off to your left. This trail accesses the Elwha River Valley and the Whiskey Bend Road.

Snowshoe Falls maybe a bit elusive and more difficult to see from the trail, but is also a beautiful natural wonder.Denny Creek was named for Arthur A. Denny, the leader of the Denny Party, some of the original settlers of Seattle, who had mining claims in the area.As you embark on the forested Denny Creek trail you find yourself immersed in an old-growth forest. Various coniferous trees provide a magnificent canopy under which you walk along a three foot wide, somewhat rocky and rooty trail. A diverse understory of ferns, salmonberry, skunk cabbage, and numerous wildflower species surrounds you. But watch out for the rather unpleasant devil’s club that is frequently found along the side of the trail!WTA has been working hard to improve drainage issues on this trail with crews working here in 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013. Evidence of this work is found in the boardwalks, crib walls, culverts, drainage ditches, and rock walls all along the trail. These structures were installed to keep the trail free of water and mud, and overall the improvements are working!After one-half mile, reach the first crossing of Denny Creek. A large, well-built bridge allows you safe passage over the waters below. A little further up the trail, you cross under a staggeringly tall viaduct. WSDOT built this soaring structure to allow winter avalanches to pass under the freeway, keeping the way clear for I-90 traffic year-round.Soon you'll enter the Alpine Lakes Wilderness, and just a short while later, arrive at the next crossing of Denny Creek and the ever popular waterslide rocks, just over a mile from the trailhead. The bridge that was once here was washed out in 2009 by avalanche debris making its way down the creek during the spring melt, so water shoes are recommended to ensure a safe fording of the creek. The swift and ever-changing current and the water's frigid temperatures can be dangerous. Be sure to assess the current conditions you are faced with before deciding whether or not to cross. Water levels can rise quickly, making this a potentially dangerous crossing.If you deem the water to be running low enough, stop here for a cool dip and a picnic on the rocks. Many people choose this as their turnaround point, which gives you an easily done day hike of about 2 miles roundtrip with 400 feet of elevation gain. If you can, keep going up the trail an additional 0.7 miles to reach the beautiful Keekwulee Falls.  Named in 1916 by a party of mountaineers, Keekwulee is a Chinook word meaning “to fall down”. The falls has two drops, totaling 125 feet; the taller of the two drops is 90 feet. It's fueled by runoff and is highest between April and July. There is an outcropping of rocks just off the trail for an excellent lunch spot with an amazing viewpoint. Making this your turnaround point gives you a five mile roundtrip hike with 803 feet of elevation gain.Snowshoe Falls is an additional one-half mile along the trail but isn’t as scenic as Keekwulee Falls. The trail leading to a viewpoint for the falls is steeper and rockier then the trail below. The waterfall itself, while larger than Keekwulee Falls, at 150 feet, is much more difficult to see from the trail. Making this your turnaround point gives you a six-mile roundtrip hike with 1345 feet in elevation gain.The trailhead has two privies, informative/interpretive signage, a picnic table, and garbage cans. The parking lot can accommodate about 40 cars with overflow parking along the roadside when needed."

Pass the junction for Ohanapecosh Hot Springs, a worthy one mile loop if you are OK with retracing your steps on this trail. If not, carry on and veer right onto the Silver Falls Trail. It is relatively flat, though the terrain is rolling and you do begin to gain elevation gradually. The wide trail means you can hike two abreast, and it’s in good enough shape that you don’t have to keep your eyes out for tripping hazards. That’s a good thing, since the forest around you is stunning. Enormous western redcedar and hemlocks, mossy granite boulders, and dry forest floor make the environment you’re hiking through truly humbling. Two wooden bridges make great spots to stop and rest if you’re hiking with young ones. After a little more than a mile and a half, come to a junction with the Laughingwater Creek Trail. Your loop heads left, curving around and down to a well-structured switchback and your first view of the falls. They are best viewed in early summer or late spring, when the snow is melting high up, but the waters of Ohanapecosh River are incredible any time of year. Descend to a sturdy bridge that spans a tight canyon. Hang on to little ones, bags, cameras, anything that could fall over – it’s a long way down and there’s no good way to retrieve anything that falls. But do be sure to peek over the side at the water – it’s a study in contrasts. The side nearest the falls is a chaos of churning white water, while the water on the other side of the footbridge is much quieter – how far down do you think you can see? To complete the loop, cross the bridge and follow the well signed trail back uphill, switchbacking to a high point and then gradually descending back to the parking area. Cross a paved bridge over a lower section of the river, where the water pools in tempting eddies, and make your way back to the parking area. WTA Pro Tip: Make a longer hike of it by taking the trail that branches off the upper end of the loop to a crossing of Highway 123 and the Grove of the Patriarchs. It’s another 2.5 miles of walking, but it’s a great way to extend your foot-powered adventure."

Start by wandering along the Wallace River as it tumbles down from the famous falls.  Get your pictures of the falls, then continue your hike by including the large forested Wallace Lake. Return through a green shag carpet of moss, sword ferns and hemlock, following the North Fork Wallace River as it rushes to meet the main Wallace River and your return trail. First, be sure that you have a trail map for reference. If necessary, take a picture of the trail map posted on the window of the ranger’s booth. Although the intersections are signed, there are many, and it is handy to have something to refer to, if in doubt. Start your hike by following an access road under the power lines. Come to an intersection and a marker dedicated to Senator Frank Woody for whom the trail is named. Stay right on the Woody Trail, enter woods and head downhill toward the sound of the Wallace River. There is a short side trail marked Small Falls which leads to, as you may expect, a small falls. It's well worth the short walk.Once back along the river, there are lots of viewpoints and a few benches. In summer, this is a busy place, as lots of families come here to enjoy a picnic by the river. Start climbing above the river. On a nice day, the light rays that come through the spindly trees make for some good pictures. Stay on the Woody trail when you reach an intersection for the railroad cutoff, and then the intersection with the Greg Ball trail. You will be returning from your hike on one of these trails.  Reach a high point, head downhill on some well built stairs, and cross the North Fork Wallace River on a good sturdy bridge. Once across, head uphill to the Lower Falls viewpoint and picnic shelter. Soon there will be some great views out across the Snohomish Valley and if you’re lucky, all the way over to the Olympics. From the lower falls, you can glimpse the large falls ahead. Keep heading up and in just over two miles from the trailhead, you will be at the middle falls. This is the best view yet of the spectacular upper falls. There is a nice viewpoint with a railing around it that will allow you to get a good look and stay safe. The water here falls is 265 feet, and is visible from Highway 2. Once the picture taking is done, head on up to the last viewpoint, in just over a half mile, where you look down from the top of the falls. To continue on to the lake, look for the trail behind the sign. It may be hard to locate. Some of this trail is well defined, but some of it gets lost in roots and rocks. Look for blue diamonds, about six feet up, on some of the trees, and follow these, and consult your map. This trail climbs a short way to meet a DNR forest road. Once you meet the road, turn left and follow the road for 1.7 miles. While road walks aren't known for their aesthetic value, but keep an eye out for pussy willows, salmonberry, coltsfoot and skunk cabbage in the spring, and mushrooms in the fall. These various flora make the wide road more interesting. But don't get sidetracked by spur roads--your next intersection is signed. Turn right and follow the road a half mile to Wallace Lake. There is a camping area off to the right here, but you'll proceed straight ahead. Cross the bridge over the outlet stream and have lunch at the picnic table on the other side. For better views of the lake, follow the old road along the lake. There are several points where you can climb down and access the lakeshore, but the best views are at the end of the lake. Keep following the trail past the sign for Jay Lake. Cross the inlet stream on some rock filled rubber steps, then hop across more streams. From here, make your way down to the shoreline for some great views of the lake and the surrounding hills. Once done exploring the lake, head back, but instead of crossing the bridge, turn to the right and head down to meet the road. Here you will turn right, and after a few hundred yards on your left, look for a sign for the trailhead via the road. Just past that sign is another one denoting the Greg Ball trail on your left. This is the trail you want. This beautifully built trail is named in memory of Greg Ball, the man who launched the WTA trail maintenance program. The path winds gently downhill, through a green carpet of moss and sword ferns, as it follows the North Fork of the Wallace River. You can see some remnants of the forest that once stood here long ago, old stumps with the springboard holes still visible through the covering of moss. There are some spectacular waterfalls here too. Listen for water crashing through a narrow gorge in the rock.  Take a look, but there are no safety barriers as of now, so stay away from the edge. There are two ways to finish the loop, both end up back on the Woody trail.  Stay on the Greg Ball Trail after it crosses the road, or walk the road a short way, and take the Railroad Cutoff. The cutoff is a little shorter, dropping 500 feet to the Woody trail. Head out the Woody trail, and finish your hike with a view of Mount Index and Mount Baring through the power lines on your way out. WTA Pro Tip: To extend your hike, continue on the trail past Wallace Lake to Jay Lake, an easy flat mile further. There is a backcountry campground at Jay Lake, consisting of tent sites, a picnic table and a composting toilet. Overnight permits are required for camping at Jay Lake and Wallace Lake. Please call the park office to acquire a permit prior to arrival at 360-793-0420. There is a maximum of 5 persons per campsite. Camp only at designated campsites."

On the way in, the trail shows off gigantic western redcedars, as well as rushing mountain streams, and an impressive rocky canyon. From the trailhead, head into the woods, immediately beginning to climb, though not too steeply, up the trail. Less than half a mile from the trailhead, a spur trail veers left. This offers an overlook of the valley below, but it makes for a better stop on the way back, so keep on truckin’. Head straight ahead on the main path through rolling forest. About two miles in, you’ll arrive at a swampy section, with a nice view to the east, featuring the Chiwawa Ridge and the Napeequa River Valley. Continuing on from the wetland, the trail begins to climb in earnest. Begin switchbacking uphill to a creek crossing. This creek, which can be very high in spring, is the outlet of the lakes above you – it's aptly named Twin Lakes Creek. If the crossing is feasible, do so safely, and resume the trail on the opposite side. You’re continuing to climb, but soon pop out of the forest and onto the side of a tight canyon, with Twin Lakes Creek rushing below you. The rocky sides of the canyon are impressive, but these boulders can move when nature wants. The trail here has suffered the consequences, and this section is narrower and more precarious than the rest of the trail to the lakes. But the canyon section is brief. Just a little more than three miles from the trailhead, you’ll get your first glimpse of the lower Twin Lakes. The trail meanders around the northeast side, offering views of the sparkling water between the brush at the edge of the lake. Stop at the old cabin, dated 1949, once used by the Department of Fish and Wildlife but now boarded up, or continue to a ramshackle boardwalk at the end of the big lake. Either destination is suitable for a lunch stop, before returning the way you came. One note: Fishing is not allowed at Twin Lakes – leave that to the birds."

Interpretive signs illuminate the past, when visitors flocked here to take advantage of the warm water that was believed to have healing properties. You can’t soak in the springs anymore (and they’re certainly not large enough to want to), but the rushing waters of the nearby Ohanapecosh River, and the history here make this a great visit for a leg stretch or a hike with little ones. The name Ohanapecosh comes from the name of a Native American village that once existed along the river. The Taidnapum Indians lived in the Cowlitz Valley, indeed, their name means “Upper Cowltiz.” The work Ohanapecosh is believed to mean “standing at the edge”.And that’s right where you start your hike. On a riverbank, right above the Ohanapecosh River. Proceed into the forest on nice wide tread, following the signs for about 0.4 miles. You’ll pass through an open, grassy meadow along boardwalk that carries you above the runoff from the hot springs. This is where the resort lodge used to sit, now returned to a more natural state. Turn right at a junction and head uphill to the main hot springs. The largest pool is quite small, but seeing the water coming out of the ground is fascinating for visitors young and old. Past the main hot springs area, the trail begins to descend via an old service road to the camping area. Stay right, and soon find yourself back at the main trailhead. Extending your trip: The Ohanapecosh Hot Springs share a trailhead with the three-mile Silver Falls Loop, a well-signed, well maintained trail to a stunning waterfall on the Ohanapecosh River.

But remember, while the beach is usually a good place for dogs to get some exercise, this particular one is closed to pups, since it’s a National Wildlife Refuge. Beginning at the large paved parking area, look for the large informational kiosk where you can pay your entrance fee. It’s $3 per family or group (which includes up to 4 people). Once you’ve done that, head into the cool forest. Overhead, the forest canopy is lush green, with mosses and leaves working together to protect you from direct sunlight as you descend to the shore. Make your way past knee-high salal and other understory, keeping one eye on the thick greenery above your head. The way is somewhat steep, as it loses 130 feet in less than half a mile, but once you arrive at the beach, it’s a delightful flat walk all the way to the lighthouse five miles from where you stand.Along the way, look out for a myriad of shorebirds. You’ll likely spy harlequin ducks and plovers, as well as dippers and of course the ever-present seagull. The best time to visit Dungeness Spit is at low tide, when there’s more land to walk on. If you’re here at high tide, simply be aware of the driftwood – it may not be as sturdy as it seems. WTA Pro Tip: The land past the lighthouse and the land bordering on Dungeness Bay (the other side of the narrow strip of land you hiked out on) is closed to visitors. It’s a protected area for the wildlife this refuge was established for, so please respect the closure."

Follow the trail through open lowland forest along the west side of the lake, gaining elevation gradually, and then on increasingly steep grade as you move away from the lake up to tiny Ipsut Pass nearly two miles from the trailhead. This pass is part of the Wonderland Trail – look down the other side of it to get an idea of how steep sections of this iconic trail are. Keep left at the pass and continue another 0.8 miles to big blue Eunice Lake. Bugs can be a bother here, but if they’re absent (or you don’t mind) stick around for a snack and a rest, or make this your destination for the day. Just be careful not to trample the fragile meadows around the lake. If you want grand views of Rainier, continue past the lake for the final uphill grind. It’s a steep mile to Tolmie Peak, and the trail curves around to the north side of the peak for views of the peaks and valleys north, including the large Carbon River Valley before delivering you to your destination. Turn your attention to the large mountain visible to the south. Rainier is huge from this vantage point, and Eunice Lake glittering at the bottom of Tolmie Peak makes for a fantastic photo from here. WTA Pro Tip: While Tolmie Peak and Eunice Lake are picturesque in the extreme, you’ll have to get your sunrise or sunset photos via dayhike. This area is closed to overnight camping.

This up-and-down trail covers 21 miles with a cumulative elevation gain of almost 4,300 feet round-trip. Your reward for the effort is magnificent Gardner Meadows, a prairie-like valley set between towering peaks and jagged ridges. What makes Gardner Meadows so magical is its park-like setting and the amazing diversity of life within it. The trail rolls into the meadows over gentle grassy hills dotted with old growth fir. Mountains and dramatic ridges ring the valley on three sides. To the north, the rocky slopes of Mount Gardner seem to lean over you. To the southwest, Abernathy Peak rises high into the sky. Immediately to the south, the teeth of a folded ridge gnaw at the horizon. Throughout the meadows, Columbian ground squirrels scatter at your approaching footsteps, whistling warnings as they dive into their innumerable burrows. Deer wander down into the meadows at dusk and back up the hillsides at dawn. Signs of cat (perhaps lynx, perhaps something larger) abound. Across the rushing waters of Wolf Creek come the yips of coyotes (or perhaps wolves – from a distance, it’s hard to tell the difference). Bluebirds, owls and juncos may shadow you along the trail. In late spring, nearly every wildflower imaginable explodes from everywhere – arrowleaf balsamroot, shooting stars, lupine, avalanche lilies, alpine strawberries, and wild rose, among others too numerous to name. The trail starts by losing 250 feet in elevation (which of course means you re-gain that same elevation on your weary way out). Shortly thereafter, it enters the Lake Chelan-Sawtooth Wilderness. At 2.6 miles, you cross the North Fork of Wolf Creek by way of a sturdy log bridge. At 3.7 miles, the trail traverses a slope of basalt that has crumbled to black sand. After that, it is a long march, devoid of major distinguishing features. There are a few camping spots along the way. Just after the crossing of the North Fork of Wolf Creek, a large meadow offers several places to pitch a tent, but this only takes you three miles towards your destination. A single camp site is available at 5.4 miles. There are several places to camp at the junction with the Abernathy Lake trail at 7.6 miles. Not long after the trail junction, you begin to leave the trees as you head into an area blackened by fire some time ago (judging by the size of the new growth, at least a decade past). As you close in on the meadows, you pass through a grove of aspen, seemingly out of place in this otherwise coniferous landscape. And then you arrive. From here, you have several options. Sit out on one of the large rocks or fallen trees and simply soak it all in. Follow the trail across Wolf Creek to its very end in a long abandoned mining claim. Find a spot in the trees to camp – there are several flat spots that make good sites. For the ambitious, an arduous climb to the summit of Gardner or North Gardner Mountain beckons.

All the same, the views from the summit of Gypsy Peak make the trip well worth it, with the added benefit of climbing a comparatively small mountain in solitude. Due to its location in the heart of the Salmo–Priest Wilderness, visitors are most apt to share the trail with resident bighorn sheep or bears. After all, the east-side trailhead is named “Bear Pasture” for a reason.Gypsy Peak is normally accessible from two different trailheads—offering the option of short or long approaches—the shorter approach, from the Bear Pasture trailhead, closes to hikers on August 15 to protect grizzly habitat. Hiking to Gypsy Peak in the fall requires the longer trek from Sullivan Mountain and the Crowell Ridge trailhead.The route is mostly above tree line, with Canada just a stone’s throw to the north and Idaho’s Selkirk Range to the east. To the west, Abercrombie and Hooknose mountains are the closest prominent peaks. At approximately 5 miles from the trailhead on Crowell Ridge, watch for the faint climber’s trail leading to Gypsy Peak. You’ll need to dig out the map and compass to remain on track for the final approach. Consider adding in a 1-mile side trip to Watch Lake, the only place available for refilling water along the way.WTA Pro Tip: This route is considered an advanced trail, requiring the use of map and compass and experience with off-trail travel. In addition, the road to the Crowell Ridge trailhead is rough and rocky; high-clearance vehicles are recommended. High elevations and exposure rob your body of precious liquids.

The Sherman Creek Wildlife Area consists of more than 9,000 acres co-managed by the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife and the U.S. Forest Service for whitetail deer winter range. Begin the hike by crossing the old Mellenberger Bridge (misspelled Malenberger on the trail sign) in front of the parking area, with Sherman Creek cascading over the rocks far below. Once across, the hike begins on an abandoned roadbed. Trail signs, installed as part of an Eagle Scout project, lead the way to the Sherman Point Trail. Turn left at the sign and follow the trail to several overlooks along Lake Roosevelt. Watch for weathered National Park Service markers on the trees and the sign pointing out an old ferry landing across from the mouth of the Colville River, a nice spot to pause for a picnic or try your fishing luck. Farther along the trail, a sign points out the striking Reed Slide Overlook with its sand cliffs gradually giving way to the forces of water and gravity. Whitetail deer abound, and near the water, one can sometimes glimpse bald eagles roosting in the trees or gliding over the lake. As the trail returns inland, watch for the sign pointing out the return route on the right just before reaching the irrigated fields (managed as part of the winter forage for the resident wildlife).WTA Pro Tip: Look for whitetail deer, mule deer, bald eagles, turkeys, waterfowl and songbirds as you hike here."

This historic 316-acre state park, nestled in the midst of the Seattle metropolitan area, has playground facilities for children, picnic areas, trails for mountain bikers, and fields for sports teams as well.Boats may be launched at the Department of Fish and Wildlife ramp in Kenmore, just north of Saint Edward State Park. The Park offers a big toy playground for children, numerous picnic tables (though the park encourages reservations for picnics), ball fields for baseball and other sports, mountain bike trails, and even a dining hall that can be reserved. Perhaps the most fascinating activity—and why you’re reading this guide description—is hiking from the hills 400 feet above Lake Washington down to the undeveloped shoreline under a dense canopy of Douglas fir, western red cedar, western hemlock, bigleaf maple, Pacific madrona, and cottonwood. Wildflowers and ground cover include sword ferns, devil’s club, candy flower, thimbleberry, red currant, Robert Geranium, Oregon grape, and bleeding heart. Be cautious of the Pacific banana slugs and European black slugs that outnumber hikers on the trail during the spring, summer, and fall months.There are many routes you can take. Some are shared with mountain bikers. For a direct hike to the lakeshore, find the Perimeter/Seminary trailhead (the widest trail) to the west of the seminary building. This route descends 360 feet over 0.62 miles to a small beach and the junction with the 0.57-mile Beach Trail, which takes off northward along the undeveloped shoreline. The beach is well-suited to wading or contemplation. Fishing is allowed with a permit from the state. There are several routes back up the hill, including the Grotto Trail (0.4 miles)—the steepest choice, the South Canyon Trail (0.9 miles)—with perhaps the most stunning forest canopy, and the South Ridge Trail/Water Tower Trail combination (1.1 miles)—which skirts the Bastyr campus. For those who desire a longer sylvan experience, find the trailheads east of the building complex near Seminary Drive to access the North Trail (1.4 miles), which becomes the Beach Trail when it nears the lake. The longest possible loop is just over 3 miles.Consider printing a map to help choose the route that best suits you and to avoid getting lost.History of the area: The Seattle Catholic Archdiocese purchased the property that is now Saint Edward State Park to build a seminary for the Sulpician Order. The area had been logged in the 19th century and again in the 1920s. The seminary was completed in 1931 and named for Edward the Confessor, king of England in the 11th Century. The seminary closed in 1977, and the Archdiocese sold 316 acres to the state of Washington for use as a park. The park opened in 1978. Subsequently the Archdiocese sold the remaining acreage to Bastyr University, which is surrounded by the Park’s grounds. In 2007 the seminary was placed on the National Historic Register."

To deliver the lead-silver ore to Everett, a railway was built along the South Fork of the Sauk River. Homesteaders filled the valley and the miners created two tiers of housing at the steep Monte Cristo site, as well as mills to process the ore. By 1893 there were more than 200 mining claims. However, the dreams of riches came to a crashing halt as funding woes, flooding along the rail line and miscalculations about the mining potential caused the production to stall and then cease by 1907. There were a few attempts to make this a resort destination, but they too were abandoned.Monte Cristo is a ghost town today. A few relics remain, but not much. When visiting, do respect the remaining structures and property. Take photos and imagine the scene here more than a hundred years ago - teaming with men and with tramways bringing ore down from the steep hillsides. Do note that this site may be closed at a future date for clean-up of hazardous materials still remaining from the mining days.Start at the Barlow Pass trailhead and hike along the closed road for about 4 miles.

An ode to lifelong nature photographer and conservationist Ira Spring, this highly popular summer trail traverses steep pitches and open meadows en route to Mason Lake, a popular weekend camping destination in its own right. From the parking lot, the trail meanders through dense forest and gently climbs a few long switchbacks until reaching Mason Creek at 0.8 mile. Normally docile from late spring to fall, be aware that high water can occur in the spring. Luckily, thanks to the efforts of volunteer crews and the generosity of the Spring Trust for Trails, a sturdy footbridge has been installed across the creek, and hikers can safely cross it in all seasons. At 1.6 miles, veer left at an obvious but unmarked junction and take a deep breath -- the real climbing starts here. Ascending several steep pitches, the trail zigzags above tree line into an alpine meadow bursting with seasonal wildflowers and mountain vistas. Stay left at the junction with the Bandera Mountain Trail at 2.9 miles and continue climbing north toward the high point of the hike, a rocky crest at 4,320 feet. Here, expansive views to the south and west reveal prime photo opportunities and glimpses of Mount Rainier on clear days.Drop over the north side of the ridge into the Alpine Lakes Wilderness, quickly descending about 300 feet to the shores of Mason Lake -- a small but deep alpine pool swimming with plump trout. The main trail continues along the west and north banks of the lake to several designated camping areas, complete with a backcountry privy. Find an unclaimed boulder on the shore and soak in sunlight while enjoying views of Bandera Mountain and its tree-lined slopes reflect off the cool waters. WTA Pro Tip: There are several ways you can lengthen your trip here.Option 1: From the junction with the Bandera Mountain Trail, head to the summit of Little Bandera Mountain -- a short but aggressive 0.6-mile jaunt to elevated lake views and sweeping northwest vistas.

Springtime is such a popular season for hiking this trail that the US Forest Service closes it to motorized use from April 1 through Jun 15 each year.

You will ford Iron Creek about 200 yards before you get to the trailhead. If your car has low clearance you can park at one of turnouts just before the ford.The Iron Bear Trail starts in forest, then proceeds through low shrubs, including serviceberry and snowbrush.

Soon, there is an opening through the trees and Mount Rainier comes into the fullest view you will have on this entire hike. It's a great photo-op, particularly in morning light. Farther up the trail, the mountain will disappear behind a shoulder of Crystal Peak, and if you hike on above Crystal Lake only the summit dome will reappear, not the entire mountain.A mile past the Crystal Peak Trail junction, come to a signed T-junction. The left branch goes on to Crystal Lake, and the right branch to Lower Crystal Lake. If the lower lake is your goal, go for it. It's only 100 yards down to the designated camp area, which includes two sites plus a bear pole, and a few feet farther to the edge of Lower Crystal Lake. Even if your goal is the upper lake, you might want to take this 100-yard side trip. The lower lake is not visible from farther up the trail, so this will be your only chance to see it.The lower lake is relatively small, with a dense growth of sedges around much of the shoreline. The lake is surrounded by small trees, and rocky peaks rise beyond the trees in the distance. It's a pleasant, peaceful spot to enjoy.The trail continues on. The forest becomes more open and when in season, wildflowers bloom along the edges of the trail. Indian paintbrush, western anemone and lupine are common here, and you will find many others. After 0.7 miles from the T-junction, reach Crystal Lake itself. The designated camping area is off to the right, and offers several sites.The upper lake is much larger than the lower lake, and it's in a dramatic setting in a basin walled by rugged peaks. Notice particularly Three Way Peak to the northeast. It has a small window through the rock formation, slightly to the right and a bit lower than the summit. Scan the peaks surrounding the lake for other interesting features. You are only three miles from the trailhead so there's no need to hurry back. Take a leisurely walk around the shore of Crystal Lake and just relax and appreciate the beautiful setting. You might even find that you have company. It's not unusual to see mountain goats or elk in the vicinity.Extending Your HikeFor many years there has been a trail that leaves Crystal Lake and climbs 600 feet in one mile, crossing the ridge east of the lake and meeting the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) just north of Sourdough Gap. Signs at the ridge top mark the park boundary and alert hikers coming from the PCT about park camping regulations, but do not mention Crystal Lakes specifically. Some earlier maps and guide books omit this trail, but it is shown on the Green Trails Mount Rainier Map (269S) and on some other recent maps.To locate the trail up to Sourdough Gap, follow the shoreline trail around the north side of Crystal Lake about 0.1 mile. Come to an obvious Y where the right fork continues on around the lake shore. The left fork is the trail you want. It heads slightly uphill toward Three Way Peak, then climbs more steeply toward the northeast before bending back south and reaching the ridge top east of Crystal Lake. In season many wildflowers bloom along the way, and there are great views looking back down on Crystal Lake, with the summit of Mount Rainier showing in the distance. From the ridge top, the trail continues on 100 yards, dropping a few feet to meet the PCT at a switchback. Continue south on the PCT an additional 200 yards to reach Sourdough Gap. Enjoy great views south to Mount Adams, Mount St. Helens and other high points, and down to Sheep Lake 600 feet below. For most hikers, the gap will be a good turn-around point.The PCT continues on, dropping down and passing Sheep Lake, then crossing Highway 410 at Chinook Pass, 2.4 miles from Sourdough Gap. This suggests the possibility of arranging a car shuffle and doing an interesting through-hike, beginning at Chinook Pass and ending at the Crystal Lakes trailhead, or vice-versa."

Each name has history, and depending on if you're a local or a visitor, you may have heard a different name. Originally, locals referred to it as Mount Pete, in honor of Pete Chorak, a Yugoslavian immigrant who settled in Enumclaw in the early 1900s, became a successful business owner, and donated some land to the town of Enumclaw. As the years wore on, ""Pete"" got misconstrued as ""Peak"", hence the newer name, Mount Peak. Between 1928 and 1971, a fire lookout perched atop the mountain was called the Pinnacle Peak Lookout, thereby dubbing the summit with a third name: ""Pinnacle Peak"". The two trails that approach the summit even have their own names: The Cal Magnusson trail, and the more direct South Trail. But whatever you call this delightful dayhike in Enumclaw, you'll get to the same place; a beautiful site of a former lookout with views of the White River drainage and the jewel of the southern Cascades: Mount Rainier. Visitors can hike, bike, run or watch wildlife. Following the Cal Magnusson Trail, hikers will climb 1000 feet in a mile, ensuring a healthy workout through thick forest. Hikers may find fascination in the basalt outcroppings just short of the summit; these are formed by the rapid cooling of lava tubes and are relatively common in the South Cascades, though always an interesting sight. If you're inclined to take the South Trail, you can expect multi-user company. Mountain bikes are permitted on this old gravel road. Because of this, the grade is more forgiving. That, combined with views of the White River and Mount Rainier make this a gentler route, though there is elevation gain to be had as the trail enters the forest and approaches the summit. If you do elect to take this route, don't forget to take a look at the columnar basalt formations, visible just a little ways down the Cal Magnusson trail from the summit. Once you've achieved the summit, take a look around the former lookout site. You can see old concrete footings that formerly supported the lookout. Now logs have been placed across these to serve as benches, where you can take a load off and enjoy the view, including Mount Rainier and much of the surrounding valley. After you've had your fill of views, head back down, either the way you came, or try for a thru-hike by heading down the trail you didn't use on the way up. Keep in mind that if you opt to do this, you'll need to arrange a car shuttle or a key swap, but it means you'll get to explore this park to its fullest in just one day."

This riverside route ambles gently up the wide Tieton River valley, rolling through broad meadows and through sun-streaked forests. Tieton River valley sits on the eastern side of the Goat Rocks Wilderness where you will find expansive views of Old Snowy Mountain. Elk can often be found browsing amongst the trees, and even if the majestic big beasts are absent, you'll likely encounter lesser critters. Pine martens scurry through the snow, as do weasels, snowshoe hares, bobcats, cougars, coyotes, foxes, and an array of birds.Hike up the road as it slides gradually up the Tieton River valley. On either side of you are towering valley walls that at times show vertical rock faces, while at other times they are lined with lush pine forests. The route crosses Hell Creek at about 1 mile, and moves along the base of the north valley wall. Here, the boundary of the Goat Rocks Wilderness is just a snowball's throw away to the right. As you continue up the road, you can enjoy wonderful views of Old Snowy Mountain, which stands like a sentinel at the head of the valley.At 2.8 miles, the road crosses Miriam Creek, and edges back toward the middle of the valley for the final run to the road's end at 5 miles, at the edge of the wilderness (the road corridor is a 5-mile long peninsula of unprotected land jutting into the wilderness). Beyond the road end, summer hiking trails continue up the valley, one eventually leading to the very summit of Old Snowy Mountain. But this trail is steep and difficult to follow come winter. Leave that for warm summer days. Instead, stick to the valley road, and if you need further adventures, bust out into the various meadows and clearings along the way to explore those wildlife refuges.Author’s Rating: Easiest. Generally good trails for beginners, with little elevation change and minimal avalanche danger."

The trail's wide, ambitious grade rewards accordingly for your efforts, ascending through stands of humbling firs, passing a picturesque waterfall, and ending on the shore of a lovely mountain lake.From the clearly marked trailhead on the decommissioned Carbon River Road, head abruptly uphill, passing an interpretive sign--one of the best you will find at a trailhead in Washington. A 3-D map of the trail area, a little natural history, and a briefing on the tried-and-true methods of wilderness common sense help you get a sense of how to appreciate the forest around you before leaving you to it.The lower half of the trail winds among ancient Douglas fir that are the hallmark of the Carbon River Rainforest. This is considered the only inland temperate rain forest of its kind, being well beyond marine areas. But just like the valleys of the wet Olympic coast, the Carbon catches showers in its trajectory, holding them longer, and making its own fog when it needs to. In other words, this valley lives and breathes differently from its neighbors.At a half mile, regard a recently-fallen giant fir as you walk along, as much as under, its extraordinary length. The lineage this tree belongs to is still thriving below this point, but above here is a transitioning forest. As you hike, younger and slimmer hemlock overtake the forest, higher in number than any other kind of tree in the area. In fact, this is the rain forest's climax state.The trail rounds an arm of mountainside near the one mile mark, and you suddenly hear Ranger Falls. Several false way trails drop to the left, but don't be tempted down them; they lead to nothing. The true Ranger Falls overlook, 200 feet off the main trail, is marked by an obvious sign. Most of the year Ranger Falls is well-fed, plunging 100 feet through a narrow slot choked with boulders and felled giants. At high summer it merely trickles in comparison.After Ranger Falls the trail makes up for lost momentum, climbing steadily through the montane zone. The canopy of interwoven hemlock (and a few silver fir) breaks for patches of sky which mark the top of the climb. A marvelous log bridge set aside a cedar with twin buttresses that resemble bellbottoms spans the stream in a serene bend worth stopping to admire. A 50-foot rise beyond the crossing brings you finally to the side of Green Lake, 1.8 miles from the trailhead -- 4.8 miles from where you left your car.Western hemlock dominate the lakeshore, suggesting an arena with sidewalls that strive to outdo the width of the lake. Logs choke the outlet of Green Lake, but make for a very scenic and fun lunch spot. One log floats freely around the lake but is usually parked near the outlet dam and is known to some as ""the surfboard.""There is no trail beyond this point and no reason to attempt to follow any way paths that dwindle among the thickly-forested shore. No camping is allowed at Green Lake. Ipsut Creek makes a good alternative, offering the amenities of a front country campground with the exception of plumbing (no fires allowed)."

Cross the Sourdough Creek trail -- which is not shown on the Green Trails map -- and follow the trail on a gentle uphill grade through old-growth forest. After climbing to 1500 feet, the trail crosses the dry streambed of Deer Creek, which provides a good demonstration of how powerful flood events can be in the North Cascades.About 1.5 miles in, where tranmsission lines cross the trail, take a very short side trip to a vista of Diablo Lake. The views improve past this overlook, and begin to include non-stop views of Pyramid, Snowfield, Davis and Colonial Peaks.

In winter, hikers can enjoy listening to only the sound of rushing water, since the highway visible across the way is closed to vehicle traffic.Continue on, enjoying views of the vibrant blue lake. Just before reaching the switchbacks that lead 600 feet down to a suspension bridge near Ross Dam, hikers will cross an avalanche track. Be wary of this in winter and early spring -- it can be dangerous since that's where snow lingers on trail. Shortly after crossing the avalanche chute, a rockslide blocks the east end of the suspension bridge at Ross Dam, so if you don't want to make the steep trek down to the bridge, you can rest at an overlook of Ross Lake Dam, enjoying the various North Cascades massifs that surround you.

The former railroad grade is wide and graveled, and gets some traffic from mountain bikers. The first part of the trail borders the Cedar River Watershed (a City of Seattle drinking water source,) and frequent signs threaten dire consequences to any who trespass there. In a similar tone, pet owners are alerted that the leash law is strictly enforced ($87 fine.)In less than a mile from the trailhead, cross Boxley Creek on a bridge edged with heavy wire mesh siding. About 100 feet beyond the bridge, a wide area on the right looks like it could lead to a trail, but that's not it. Continue on another 200 yards and find the signed Cedar Butte Trail on the right. The Green Trails map 205S (2004 edition) indicates this is Department of Natural Resources Land, but the sign at the beginning of the trail says it is part of Olallie State Park. (Perhaps state agency boundaries have changed.)Follow the Cedar Butte Trail uphill and, in about 0.3 miles, come to an unsigned trail fork. Both branches lead to Cedar Butte, but the left fork is more direct. The right fork is about a half-mile longer, and detours past the site of the ""Boxley Blowout,"" a 1918 power dam failure that destroyed the logging community of Edgewick, with no fatalities. For more information, see the History Link site:  http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&File_Id=2426Only the left branch of the Cedar Butte Trail is shown on the Green Trails Map. The two branches reconnect at the signed Saddle Junction, and the trail continues on, via several switchbacks, toward the summit. Near the top, you might get a glimpse of Rattlesnake Lake through the trees.On the final approach to the summit, the trail narrows and follows along the upper edge of the steep north face of Cedar Butte. At the summit there are two very low log seats, and a USGS Bench Mark from 1937 stamped with the imaginative spelling ""Ceder Butt.""The summit is forested, but there are views out toward the north looking up the Middle Fork of the Snoqualmie River, with Mount Si, Mount Teneriffe, Green Mountain, Russian Butte and Mailbox Peak all visible.When you are ready to descend, note a small sign with an arrow that points out an alternative trail. It avoids the narrow section along the steep north face of the butte, and soon rejoins the main trail. (But, unless the upcoming trail is crowded, this is just an option, and you might as well descend the main trail.) Return to the trailhead the way you came or, if you feel like exploring when you get back to Saddle Junction, consider taking the trail branch you did not arrive on."

As if that weren’t enough, it also provides access to two summit scrambles and, in the right season, a wealth of wild blueberries and fall color. Tread lightly, and stay on the trail! In recognition of the incredible diversity of native plant life here – a stunning concentration of species rarely seen anywhere else in the Cascades – the entire area from the tip of Stillaguamish Peak to the summit of Mount Forgotten to the top of Mount Dickerman is a research natural area that could (in theory) be closed to all but scientific use. Thankfully, it's not, and hikers can enjoy the flora of this area. Start at the trailhead for Mount Dickerman. The Perry Creek trail leaves from the west end of the parking lot. The first mile is a mostly flat section that connects to an old road that leads a fifth of a mile to the former trailhead. At the occasional open spot along the way, enjoy views of Big Four Mountain’s north face and snowfields. After a short stretch in dense forest, the trail breaks out into the open. From here, the same attributes that make the Perry Creek drainage so hospitable to so many different types of plants make it an awesome place to hike. The trail traverses the east side of the drainage, which is frequently intersected by talus slopes from the steep rock of Mount Dickerman overhead. These disturbed areas allow sunlight to reach hillsides that would otherwise be shaded by conifers, giving perennial plants a chance to flourish and providing hikers with views over the lush canopy below. On the far side of the creek, gaze upon waterfalls pouring down from green meadows on the upper slopes of Stillaguamish Peak. Where shade persists on the trail, abundant rain from the Puget Sound Convergence Zone carpets every available surface with thick moss. In places, ancient old-growth cedars rub shoulders with deciduous hardwoods. To the untrained eye, all this may seem merely scenic; but there are some 250 different species of plant life here, many of them in the short distance below Perry Creek Falls. After years of lobbying by the Washington Native Plant Society and noted botanist Art Kruckeberg, the biodiversity found here led the Forest Service to set the area aside in 1997 as a research natural area. As wild as the environs of the entire Mountain Loop might feel, Perry Creek falls just outside of both the nearby Henry M. Jackson and Glacier Peak Wildernesses. The research natural area designation gives it something of a status even more protected than that of a wilderness – the Forest Service’s guidelines call for not encouraging recreational activities in a national research area, since the area is meant to be “unmodified.” Camping and fires, though not expressly prohibited in the Perry Creek area, are discouraged. Two miles from the old trailhead, the trail reaches Perry Creek Falls, a tall rocky tumble of rushing whitewater. Unfortunately, much of the falls is hidden under a steep overhang; if you approach the edge for a look down, do so with great caution. For many, this makes a good destination in and of itself, but the trail continues on, crossing over Perry Creek a short distance above the falls. Past this overlook, there is no bridge, so be prepared to get your feet wet when the water is high, and turn around if you're uncomfortable. Head into old-growth forest on the west side of the gorge. Here the way steepens as it switchbacks through the trees, gaining 2,000 feet in two miles. A little over a mile and a half from the creek crossing, the trail seems to branch off to the left. A short walk takes you to a saddle looking out at the deep valley between Stillaguamish Peak and Mount Forgotten. Some guidebooks identify this as the Mount Forgotten Meadows, but it is in fact the beginning of a rough climber’s trail that heads off to Stillaguamish Peak. Return to the trail (or stay right all along) and in a third of a mile or so, reach the actual meadows, marked by a high point to the left and tarns to the right. It may have been a long haul to get here, but the views are worth it. Across the tarns, look out to the meadow’s namesake, Mount Forgotten, to which a much rougher climbers’ trail continues. In fall, blueberries abound, attracting not only keen-eyed hikers but the occasional bear as well. As you continue back, the greatest reward of all may still await: another chance to appreciate a place where sun, rain, and terrain converge to produce an incomparably rich explosion of life."

The folksy name is a reference to the steam whistle sounds heard throughout the Tigers in the early days of logging. More recently (1970s) the area around Poo Poo Point was logged by its then owners, Weyerhaeuser Corporation. They even took the stumps! The result is a large clear area used now as a launching pad by paragliders who generally backpack their lightweight gear up the Chirico Trail, or sometimes arrive by minibus. The Point also offers a fine view northwest across Issaquah and Lake Sammamish toward Bellevue's downtown. To the west are Squak and Cougar Mountains, with a hint of Seattle's tallest buildings showing beyond.From the trailhead on Second Ave SE in Issaquah take the unsigned trail, passing swampy areas and the high school athletic fields. In 0.3 miles come to the first trail sign, placed there by the Issaquah Alps Trail Club to mark the start of the High School Trail. Turn right at the sign and, in 100 feet or so, bear right again, heading uphill on an old road grade. A later sign indicates passage from the Issaquah city limits into Tiger Mountain State Forest. Another sign mentions wildlife, and displays prominent images of a bear and a cougar. They are out there, of course, but the likelihood of a sighting is very slight.Continue on the old road bed, ignoring side trails whether signed or unsigned. At 0.8 miles cross a small creek that flows all year from Round Lake on the Tradition Plateau. At 0.9 miles come to a power line. A few feet to the left a wooden trail sign points to the right up a rocky slope, indicating the way to the Poo Poo Point and Section Line Trails. Hike that way, and very soon come to the signed beginning of the Poo Poo Point Trail. The fainter trail heading left though a wooden gate is the steep Section Line Trail that goes to West Tiger #3.The Poo Poo Point Trail crosses the open route of a buried gas line, then climbs steadily up an old railroad grade through mixed deciduous and coniferous forest. In early spring, look for trillium, bleeding heart, and yellow violets. Later in the summer, be alert for salmonberries or thimble berries. Throughout the year, hikers can enjoy the vigorous growth of ferns and the accumulations of moss on trees.The route traverses Many Creeks Valley crossing a number of small creeks, some of them seasonal, then levels out briefly to cross Gap Creek on a high bridge. This is a great place to pause and view the stream and many large mossy trees. The trail then continues on more steeply through coniferous forest. Note the many old decaying stumps, a remnant from logging days, some of them now appealing abstract sculptures in reddish brown tones.Soon, reach a signed three-way trail junction and the highest elevation of your hike. To the left is the West Tiger Railroad Grade, straight ahead is the One View Trail. Head to the right, where the trail continues to Poo Poo Point, now just a half-mile away. The trail loses 170 feet of elevation before resuming a very gentle climb on an old logging grade to reach Poo Poo Point - specifically, the North Launch Viewpoint. The gravel road seen arriving at the Point is the West Side Road, one of several non-public service roads that begin at the Tiger Summit on Highway 18.The Point is a great spot to sit and enjoy the view and have a snack. There are two picnic tables, and there is a Clivus toilet. There is no regular water source at the Point. If your timing is right you may enjoy seeing a few paragliders soar off the steep northwestern face of the Point."

The Greenwater River is your constant companion on this hike, winding with you through cool, old-growth forest along this quiet path to two basin lakes. As you walk, watch for the deer and elk that make this area their home.This trail is also used by equestrians, Horse fords for crossing the river are clearly marked with charming wood signs. Be sure to share the trail accordingly! From the trailhead the hike begins on a very wide, gentle trail. The first two miles to Greenwater Lakes is almost entirely flat, helping to quickly pull you deeper into the forest. Expect to cross a half dozen bridges along the way as the trail follows the path of least resistance up the river valley.Before long, you’ll find yourself at the first of the Greenwater Lakes, which tends to feel a little more like a widening in the river than a true lake. A few campsites can be found here if you follow small side trails around the lake.Continue to upper Greenwater Lake just beyond the Norse Peak Wilderness boundary. Here the trail temporarily leaves the banks of the river and the forest transitions away from alders and vine maples toward old growth firs and cedars and the crowds begin to thin. Past the wilderness boundary the trail hits a junction with Lost Lake Trail 1185, heading up to the right. Continue to the left towards Echo Lake.Now the grade becomes more challenging as the trail climbs a ridge above the Greenwater River. Near the top of the rise the Maggie Creek Trail 1186 splits off to the left. Keep climbing to the top and down the other side to Echo Lake. Here the path can be very narrow with steep drops on one or both sides so please use caution!The forested shores of the lake do not offer huge views, but there are plenty of campsites as well as places for swimming, sunning and relaxing along the lake. From here, if you’re looking for a longer, more challenging day, you can continue onward to Noble Knob and Corral Pass."

Climb steadily uphill and, in a half-mile, come to Mason Creek. Pause here to take in the view of 5162-foot McClellan Butte to the south. It will be visible for much of your hike, but it is most dramatic from this lower vantage. Once you reach the summit of 5584-foot Mount Defiance you will be over 400 feet higher than McClellan. Mason Creek, in late spring or summer, is easily crossed on boulders or small logs. But in early spring, with snow melting rapidly above, the creek can become a torrent that may be hazardous to cross. If you are uncomfortable, consider coming back in a week or two, but note that in the spring of 2015, plans were announced for a bridge across Mason Creek. Rustic materials began to accumulate at the site. Soon this crossing will be easy in all seasons.Continue on the logging grade a while, then leave the grade for a steeper climb with a few switchbacks. Look for the summit dome of Mount Rainier to appear over the southern horizon and, in more open areas along the trail, be alert for Indian paintbrush and lupine. When the trail passes through a short, dark forest section you may see a few stalks of coralroot in bloom.The trail emerges onto boulder fields, but with comfortable footing. In late spring or early summer you will be surrounded by a forest of beargrass interspersed with other flowers. Mount Defiance will be visible up ahead. Hike past the side trail to Bandera Mountain and press on toward Mason Lake. At the ridge top a memorial plaque honors Ira Spring, the well-known advocate for trails. Look for it just before descending some 200 feet toward Mason Lake. There is more shade on the north side of the ridge and, early in the season, the trail may still be moist or even muddy in spots. At the outlet of the lake cross Mason Creek once again, this time on secure boulders, and continue on. Soon, a sign for ""Main Trail"" points up some stepping stones while a lower trail leads to possible camp sites or fishing access.Farther along, the trail forks. A small sign will direct you to the right fork for the Main Trail. (The left branch would lead you into a swampy area and, eventually, to Little Mason Lake.) The right branch is your route for Mount Defiance, and in spring or early summer it too can have significant muddy spots. About 0.3 miles from the lake outlet come to a signed T-junction with the Mount Defiance Trail (#1009,) and turn left there.The route climbs steeply up the forested, shady east slope of Mount Defiance, with a few switchbacks. The way can be quite rooty and moist, and patches of snow can linger here well into July. Footprints in the snow, left by earlier hikers, will likely be visible, and the trail itself may reappear from time to time. Later in the summer the snow will be completely gone, the footing drier and the trail clear.The route winds around the south side of Mount Defiance where the snow disappears much earlier. After a few more switchbacks it emerges into a meadow. There, as the last of the snow is melting - perhaps in early June - a multitude of glacier lilies appears. But they are early bloomers, and to see them you may have to tolerate a few snow patches on Defiance's shady east side. As the season progresses other flowers will appear in the meadow.The trail traverses the meadow to its west end, where an unsigned but obvious route heads steeply upslope. It's rough, but easily followed and not dangerous. Trekking poles might be helpful. After a gain of less than 400 feet you will be on the stony summit of Mount Defiance.  Take in the views in every direction. Clouds permitting, a wide swath of summits will be visible from Mounts Adams and Rainier in the south to Mount Baker in the far north, with a host of Cascade peaks in between. Nearby, look for Granite and Bandera Mountains, and to the west look for Dirty Harry's Peak, Russian Butte, and Mount Teneriffe. The lake 1800 feet below is Lake Kulla Kulla. Often you will see sunlight glinting off ripples on its surface. Other, smaller lakes are visible too. Check your map and try to identify some of them, and perhaps identify additional peaks as well. Mount Defiance is an exceptional viewpoint for learning the layout of the surrounding terrain.WTA Pro-Tip: On a summer afternoon, uphill hikers may find temperatures on the boulder fields uncomfortably warm. Unless it's a really cool day, consider beginning your hike at an early hour."

The lake is on Heather Ridge (also known as Skyline Ridge), which is the mountain on the north side of the Stevens Pass. On clear days the lake and ridge offer expansive views of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness to the south and the Glacier Peak Wilderness to the north. Early in the trip there are nice views of Cowboy Mountain and Big Chief Mountain towering over the Stevens Pass ski area. Comparable views are much harder to achieve with other snowshoe trips in the area. On partially cloudy days, the trip is often spectacular with clouds moving through the pass area, partially obscuring the views, and resulting in beautiful light conditions for photographers. The lake is a popular winter camping destination.The location at the top of the Stevens Pass helps when seeking good snowpack early in the winter season. When other locations are wet and slushy due to warmer weather, this is often a great place to enjoy dry snow conditions. The route to Skyline Lake has limited avalanche risk, so it can also be a good destination when other options are too dangerous. However, slopes west and east of the service road are avalanche-prone, so it is important to stick to the route. Overall, the route is suitable for beginners, but is fairly steep compared to some other beginner options, such as Gold Creek Pond or Hurricane Ridge. Because the ascent is entirely on the service road, it only requires fitness and is not in any way technically challenging.Starting from the north Stevens Pass parking lot (just east of the pass), the narrow and steep service road leads to two radio tower locations. The road starts between a few cabins west of the parking area. There are two ways to get to the service road, one road starts at the foot bridge across the US 2, the other road is more north halfway the parking area. After entering the actual service road, the road soon crosses under transmission lines. The road is occasionally groomed.The route is used by many different winter recreationists, mostly snowshoers, but also skiers heading for the Moonlight Bowl (the slope to the east) and backcountry skiers heading to the backside of the ridge and Tye Peak (Pt 5476). It is also common to see groups for avalanche courses in this area. Where possible, try to maintain a separate snowshoe track next to the skin track made by skiers. The lower section of the road is also used by families for sledding.After about 800 feet on the trail, at 4875 feet of elevation there is a radio tower. This is the only radio tower you will encounter on this trip. From it, follow the service road for three more switchbacks, after which the road noticeably flattens out at 5050 feet. The route to Skyline Lake is northwest from this point, leaving the service road. There is usually a track, but if you’re the first in fresh snow, then head northwest, gently ascending for a quarter of a mile to reach Skyline Lake. From the point where you left the service road, the road continues in a northeast direction for a quarter of a mile to a second radio tower. If you do happen to continue to that tower, just backtrack a bit to find the route to Skyline Lake.Skyline Lake at 5092 feet has a great view of Cowboy Mountain and Big Chief Mountain, with many summits of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness just barely peeking over this ridge. To the left (southeast), the Chiwaukum Mountains are just visible, and to the right (southwest) you can now see Mounts Daniel and Hinman. Avoid traversing the lake, because the ice is not always thick enough to hold the weight of a person.While the views at the lake are gorgeous, it is highly recommended to continue to the gap on the ridge northwest of Skyline Lake. This adds about 100 feet of elevation gain, but opens up the views to the north, where you can see Glacier Peak, Mount McCausland, the impressive vertical rock of Lichtenberg, and many more peaks. The beautiful Monte Cristo group is visible northwest, and east there is the Nason Ridge with Rock Mountain and Mount Howard. Far south you can clearly see Mount Stuart and more summits of the Enchantments.From the gap, you can follow the ridge west for a quarter of a mile to a beautiful rock garden just before a steep high point on the ridge. The rock garden features enormous rocks, some house-sized; these are beautiful when covered in snow. But it’s best to admire the scene from a distance, because there can be dangerous open spaces around the rocks below the snow. This short ridge walk adds another 100 feet of elevation gain, but is absolutely worth it.The route is 1100 feet of elevation gain to the lake, and 1300 feet to the rock garden on the ridge.The snowshoe trip can further be extended to Tye Peak (Pt 5476) by descending into the drainage north of Heather Ridge, but this is strictly for experienced snowshoers and requires some expertise in route finding and evaluating the avalanche risk. This extension more than doubles the total elevation gain."

Choose from Trout Lake (1.6 miles each way with 500 feet of elevation gain), Copper Lake (4.2 miles each way with 2400 feet of elevation gain), or Big Heart Lake at 7.3 miles each way, with 3300 feet elevation gain). Not enough choices? There's also Little Heart Lake between Copper and Big Heart Lakes, or Lake Malachite, a short side trip from the main trail before you reach Copper Lake.So pick your goal, sign in at the trailhead and begin your hike. You will enter the Alpine Lakes Wilderness almost immediately. Along the trail, be alert for occasional exceptionally-large trees that somehow survived loggers and forest fires. When you come upon one of these solitary giants, reflect that trees of that size once were common in Northwest forests.At first the trail is reasonably level, although that will change. In 0.9 miles come to a one-lane bridge across the West Fork of the Foss River, and pause to admire the stream. When you contemplate the steep grade, and the size of the tree trunks strewn along the rocky banks, you can understand how an earlier bridge was destroyed by flood waters and debris. The replacement bridge seems sturdy enough, and high enough, to survive for a while.Continue on another 0.7 mile, with some uphill, and reach Trout Lake. Hikers or backpackers seeking an easier day may choose to stop here. The lake is in a pleasant forested setting, with several potential campsites, and there is a view looking up past the lake to some of the high country beyond. If you plan to continue on as far as Big Heart Lake, your route will take you up onto those heights, and you will have a view looking back down at Trout Lake.The trail passes around the west side of Trout Lake, then begins to climb in earnest, gaining 1900 feet in less than two miles on a very rocky route. It has many switchbacks but not a lot of shade, so it's easy to get overheated here on a sunny afternoon. This is good incentive to start your hike early.There aren't many wildflowers along this slope, but in summer you are likely to find pearly everlasting, a trace of yarrow, and some fireweed. As you climb, the sound of rushing water is always close by, and you will have occasional glimpses of the white rapids. Near the top of the switchbacks, an impressive cascade comes into full view. It's the outlet stream from Copper Lake plunging over the headwall.Eventually you'll get above the cascade and come to a trail fork where a weathered sign indicates the way to Lake Malachite. Whatever your goal for today, don't rule out a side trip to Lake Malachite. It's just over 0.1 mile to the lake, with a somewhat stony climb of about 100 feet on rudimentary trail. Lake Malachite is a very pretty lake, particularly in morning light. You might even find a campsite along the eastern edge. Climbers intent on summiting 6,261-foot Malachite Peak sometimes bivouac here.If you are going on, return 0.1 mile to the main trail and continue another 0.3 miles to reach Copper Lake, crossing the outlet stream on a picturesque group of secure boulders. Copper Lake is somewhat larger than Lake Malachite but in a similar setting, and there are good options for campsites along the northern shore.Many day-hikers choose to turn around at Copper Lake, but the trail does go on. Follow a rocky trail along the eastern shore of Copper Lake, with some ups and downs, then head gently uphill toward Little Heart Lake. In summer, you might find blueberries or thimbleberries beside the trail, although they disappear quickly, thanks to wildlife and your fellow hikers. A few wildflowers bloom here, even a bit of beargrass, and there are some potential campsites along the way. Little Heart Lake itself is 1.3 miles from the outlet of Copper Lake, and it's about the size of Trout Lake. It has a very rocky shoreline, but you might be able to find some camping options near the outlet.Beyond Little Heart Lake there is more elevation to be gained, about 700 feet in 1.1 miles, that will bring you to a high point. From there you can look back down on Trout Lake, and glimpse Glacier Peak looming dramatically in the distance. Also below, and off to the right, is Delta Lake.Big Heart Lake is about 0.7 miles beyond the high point, and about 300 feet lower-elevation you will have to regain on your return. But press on, it's worth it. The trail descends gently, with an occasional switchback, then levels out and reaches a point overlooking the lake and its outlet stream. There is room for a few campers here, and there is a great view looking south up the lake. It's possible to scramble across the log jam at the lake outlet and continue on rudimentary trails to reach Angeline Lake and other lakes. Check your map for possibilities. But you are 7.3 miles from the trailhead, and if you are a day-hiker then Big Heart Lake may be a good place to turn around. If you are a backpacker, you can set up camp at Big Heart Lake, and enjoy additional explorations the following day."

Hike either 16 miles or just two, depending on which trail you use. When the gate on this access road is open, it's possible to drive to the summit of Suntop, but hiking is much more enjoyable. The shorter approach allows hikers to switchback up from the parking area just one mile to the summit, crossing Forest Road 73 on the way. This crossing can be confusing, so note that at it, the trail to the left (south) heads through the forest, along a beautiful ridge and back down to the valley trailhead for the longer route to Suntop. The trail to the right (north) heads to the lookout. This makes for a short, sweet little hike, but be sure to keep a close eye on your map, since signage can be confusing here. For the longer hike, start on level ground, hiking through old-growth timber, gradually climbing before crossing road 7160310 at the first mile point. Climb into an old tree harvest unit, then join up with Forest Road 7160 at mile 2.4 and follow it to the left.

Enjoy the surreal volcanic rock formations, the steepness of the terrain, and the contrast between the gray rocks here and the green of Van Trump Park to the east.Note: Stevens and Van Trump probably did not stand on the true summit of Mount Rainier, but they are credited with the first ascent, two months ahead of geologists Samuel Emmons and Allen Wilson. That is why the names Van Trump and Stevens are attached to numerous features in Mount Rainier National Park.A Yakima Indian named Sluiskin guided Stevens and Van Trump up the Muir snowfield to 9200 feet, but refused to go higher. Other native guides had similarly stopped short of the summit, largely because of Sluiskin’s grandfather, who decades earlier had climbed the highest of any native on Takhoma (Mount Rainier). He had not summited, and strongly advised against it, reporting that Takhoma was inhabited by an evil spirit who dwelt in a fiery lake on its summit.(Source: “The Stevens and Van Trump Ascent of Mount Rainier, August 1870”, Northwest Discovery - The Journal of Northwest History and Natural History, Northwest Press.)Van Trump Park was not along the First Ascent route.

Van Trump and his partner Hazard Stevens, are credited with the first ascent of Mount Rainier in August 1870. See the note below for more information about this historic climb of Washington's highest peak.Follow Van Trump Creek upstream, as it roars through a narrow gorge with numerous cascades and small waterfalls. At 1.6 miles, round a corner to see a striking three-tiered waterfall: Bloucher Falls. Cross the footlog, then go left below the bank to rejoin the trail, which soon after provides the first clear view of Comet Falls. At 1.9 miles and 4875 feet, a side path to the left approaches the 392 foot falls.To continue, go right and begin ascending steeply. Gain 650 feet in 0.6 mile to arrive at a junction, often buried under several feet of snow into July. Go right and climb to a green meadow which provides glimpses of Mount Rainier - a teaser for what’s ahead. At 0.3 mile from the junction, a sign marks the end of the maintained trail at 5850 feet--this is Van Trump Park! Views to the south include Mount Adams and Mount St. Helens. Walk a short distance of unmaintained trail to drink in beautiful views of Mount Rainier from a vast green meadow.To reach Mildred Point, walk 0.3 mile back to the junction, then go right and drop 200 feet to a log crossing of Van Trump Creek. Here, turn left after you admire Upper Comet Falls upstream, and gaze over the top of Comet Falls on your way to another junction, half a mile from the previous one. Take a right to go to Mildred Point; the final half mile leads you along a trail that gets narrow, steep, rutted, and overgrown, but passes gorgeous wildflowers. 3.5 miles from the trailhead is Mildred Point, a bluff at 5900 feet overlooking the vast and rocky Kautz Creek valley, with unobstructed views of Mount Rainier. Enjoy the surreal volcanic rock formations, the steepness of the terrain, and the contrast between the gray rocks here and the green of Van Trump Park to the east.If you're feeling ambitious, consider making this a thru-hike. It's possible to hike out of Van Trump Park down Rampart Ridge. It's four miles if you elect to do this, and know that you will need to arrange a shuttle from the Longmire parking lot back up to your car at the trailhead.  Note: Stevens and Van Trump probably did not stand on the true summit of Mount Rainier, but they are credited with the first ascent, two months ahead of geologists Samuel Emmons and Allen Wilson. That is why the names Van Trump and Stevens are attached to numerous features in Mount Rainier National Park.A Yakima Indian named Sluiskin guided Stevens and Van Trump up the Muir snowfield to 9200 feet, but refused to go higher. Other native guides had similarly stopped short of the summit, largely because of Sluiskin’s grandfather, who decades earlier had climbed the highest of any native on Takhoma (Mount Rainier). He had not summited, and strongly advised against it, reporting that Takhoma was inhabited by an evil spirit who dwelt in a fiery lake on its summit.(Source: “The Stevens and Van Trump Ascent of Mount Rainier, August 1870”, Northwest Discovery - The Journal of Northwest History and Natural History, Northwest Press.)Van Trump Park was not along the First Ascent route. A monument to the climbers along their actual route can be found by hiking the Skyline Trail from Paradise to Sluiskin Falls, which they named for their guide."

For the most part, it’s ramble with moderate grade, but in the last two and a half miles, the trail changes character dramatically—putting you through a steep, thigh-burning workout before rewarding you with views of Mount Mystery and Little Mystery just inside the National Park boundary. From the parking lot, walk back across the bridge over the Dungeness River and step immediately onto the Dungeness Trail. After an initial climb away from the road, the trail flattens out, and rolls along for a mile to a junction. The right-hand trail leads away to Royal Basin and Royal Lake, seven miles away, a great hike, but one for another day. Your trail is across the footlog over Royal Creek and into the Buckhorn Wilderness. Follow the Dungeness River, and note the icy blue-green waters. This remarkable color is due to glacial silt that filters down from the high country sources of the Upper Dungeness River. It contrasts gorgeously with the fluffy mosses here in every shade of green, from lime to emerald. Be sure and get some photos. After 2.4 miles of hiking, there is a fork in the trail. To press on, stay left, but if you need a rest, head right and downhill to Camp Handy. This is a nice camping area, with a three-walled shelter at the east side of a large meadow. Once you’re rested, rejoin the main trail and continue hiking another 0.3 miles to another trail junction. The left-hand trail, signed for Marmot Pass, leads to Boulder Camp and eventually the pass. For a description of that hike, see our writeup for the Upper Dungeness River. For this hike, you’ll take the right-hand trail, which continues at a gentler grade for another three-quarters of a mile before breaking out into another open meadow, where the trail skirts the forest on the left side of the meadow.In 2015, WTA volunteers worked on a large drainage project here. A seasonal creek blew out the trail, and a crew of eight volunteers spent part of a BCRT creating a diversion dam and refilling a section of the tread, which was more than two feet below ground level in places. Check out their handiwork as you press on. The trail now becomes more rugged. It can be difficult to see as you pass through two more meadow areas, but as you head deeper into the forest, it’s clearly delineated, if a bit rooty. The forest floor along the trail becomes cushioned with a variety of mosses. Look for feather moss, oxalis, and many, many other types of lichens and moss. About a mile from the site of the WTA project (and over one short but steep ridge climb) is your final log bridge to cross. This is also where the trail changes character, beginning an incline that becomes ever steeper as you near the end of the trail. Switchbacks are nowhere in sight, and opportunities for water become scarce as you near the boundary, so be sure and fill up where you can safely reach water. The last mile is the steepest and most exposed, but also offers views of Marmot Pass and Buckhorn Mountain, as well as glimpses of Heather Creek far below you in the valley. Then suddenly, you’re at the park boundary. The trail ends here, though there is one more camp just inside the park—downhill and to your left from the boundary sign. To your right is a short bootpath to a nice overlook of Mount Mystery to your right and Little Mystery straight ahead. WTA Pro Tip: While they may seem superfluous for the first part of the hike, bring trekking poles with you! Your knees will thank you when you’re doing that last steep section."

The original forest here was logged a century ago and now the trees are in a state of early maturation.At a quarter mile the trail jogs across an old logging road and soon enters old growth. The forest opens up with sword fern and shrubs among the stately trunks of ancient firs, which give way to hemlock as the trail climbs ever upward. It is cool and moist on the north aspect of the slope, enabling skunk cabbage and trillium to bloom into early summer. The forest to Mink Lake is beautiful, packed full of Queen's Cup, lilies and bunchberry flowers in bloom. At two miles, the trail rounds a spur at about 2800 feet, before gently arching toward the lake.At 2.5 miles and 3100 feet lies tiny Mink Lake. Hemlock, silver fir, and marshy beargrass meadows line the tranquil waters, which are often disturbed by jumping fish. Depending on the season, you may see Western Coralroot orchids and Indian Pipe, or beargrass, anenomes and violets around the lake.A side trail forks left where overnight hikers will find the bear wire and an old shelter, now home to rodents.The lake, while picturesque, is a haven for mosquitoes--bring plenty of bug spray or patience, whichever you prefer. The silence and unbroken stands of trees that surrounded the lake are gorgeous, and on the way down, you can study the intricate patterns of roots, flora and other wonders of a healthy forest."

The south side trailhead is on the Dosewallips Road. This segment’s notoriously steep grade to 5050 Pass means it is seldom used. Try it and you’ll find out why.Most hikers access the trail from the north side where for the first three miles the route is often within earshot of Tunnel Creek. This route is 9.4 miles round trip to 5050 Pass.Tunnel Creek has no tunnel. The name comes from the stream’s habit of not visibly flowing and leaving stretches of dry creek bed during low water periods.   The path heads through impressive stands of Douglas Fir and Hemlock. The trees and the ridge of 5050 Pass to the south keep hikers in cool shade in summer and even cold in the shoulder seasons.  At 2.7 miles Tunnel Creek Shelter offers several campsites. Soon you will cross the South Fork of Tunnel Creek on a short bridge that, because of the shade and spray, is often slippery.  There are distracting views from the bridge of twin cataracts tumbling through moss carpeted forest.From here the trail rises on the north face of the ridge, offering views of Mount Constance to the west that improve from peek-a-boo windows to sweeping panoramas at the 5050 Pass ridge top. The trail passes Harrison Lakes, shallow pools nestled into benches on the ridge. On nearly still days, their rippling reflections create Impressionist images of the surroundings. Pick an autumn day for the color show put on by the shoreline of azaleas and huckleberry bushes. At 5050 Pass, there are two side trails along the ridgeline that offer even better views of Constance and more distant peaks and ranges. One trail runs east, the other heads west.

Look no further than Franklin Falls! At just 2 miles roundtrip with 400 feet in elevation gain it is the perfect destination for any hiker looking for something easy and beautiful.WTA has done trail work here for the last ten years, building walls and rocks steps and constructing bridges to make this trail as safe as possible for even the smallest of hikers. There are a few spots where bits of the trail have been washed out, or handrails haven’t been installed, but overall you can feel confident in bringing your youngsters here for a safe and fun day on the trail. The trail includes a number of stairs with a very gentle incline that is easily hiked. As you hike, you'll be enshrouded in a thick canopy of coniferous trees which makes it a great trail to do on a hot day. At .7 miles in, the trail draws parallel to National Forest Road 58 for a short time. Just .3 miles further along, you reach picturesque Franklin Falls. The falls are situated between two tall viaducts that allow traffic along I-90 to pass year-round without interference from avalanches in winter. The falls are actually comprised of three separate tiers, giving them a total drop of 135 feet. However, only the last and largest drop can be seen from the trail. At 70 feet, Franklin Falls is a spectacular sight to see, with its best flows between April and July. There is a viewpoint before reaching the falls but hikers can get closer by following a narrow trail gouged into the side of the rock. Use caution and keep children close as the rocks are often wet and potentially slippery. The falls, when running at peak, give off a pretty heavy spray so rain gear is a good idea if you want to get close. During lower flow periods there is more room to roam by the base of the falls. In the wintertime this also makes an excellent destination for an easy snowshoe, though hikers are well-advised to not venture to the splash pool in icy conditions. The falls run year round and the incredible icicle formations along the rock face around the falls are spectacular--well worth the trip. The parking lot can hold around 15 cars and there is overflow parking along the roadside. There is no privy at this trailhead but there are toilets at the Denny Creek Campground, just a stone's throw from the trailhead. There are no garbage receptacles at the trailhead so be sure to pack it out!Pro Tip: Arrive early to ensure a parking spot and enjoy the trail before it becomes too crowded."

When the Yakima Basalt Formation--a series of lava flows with sediment deposits--covered the area. Devil Creek eventually eroded these deposits, causing sediment to collapse and the caves to form. A short hike to the natural wonders left behind by the erosion process makes this trail popular on summer weekends.The trail to Boulder Cave was built by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) in 1930s and has been improved several times since then, most recently in 2014. The trail is signed as the Sun and Sage loop and it follows a small ravine. Make sure to keep an eye out for the lookout platform over the gorge just after the first hill. The path climbs gradually with a number of interpretive signs about the local ecology and history along the way.As the trail flattens out, look to the far side of the ravine to see a new cave beginning to form. Then wind your way down to the the cave entrance. This cave formation is more of a tunnel so the trail through is one way, follow the sign to the right and the cave entrance.

From the inspiring Poet Peaks, to the emerald-cloaked summits along the Cascade crest, to cloud-piercing, snow-catching, ice-harboring, horizon-dominating Glacier Peak!Three wonderful trails begin from this spot. Take the one that veers left (west), signed ""Cady Creek."" The way quickly drops into a gorge, crossing the Little Wenatchee River on a solid bridge. Enter wilderness, and after 0.5 mile of easy wandering come to a junction. The Cady Creek Trail continues west for 4.7 easy miles to 4300-foot Cady Pass, traversing magnificent old-growth forests en route. Head right instead onto the Cady Ridge Trail, which travels steep forested slopes en route to magnificent meadows.Immediately gaining elevation, the trail gets progressively steeper as it marches up Cady Ridge. Pass a small creek in a thick hemlock grove. Depending on the snowmelt above, this may be the last source of reliable water along the trail. After a series of tight switchbacks, the way gets even steeper-and dustier and rockier too. After about 2 monotonous miles of climbing, openings in the forest begin to provide teaser views.Thankfully, the grade begins to ease, and after about another mile of slogging the way crests a 5300-foot knoll. Look up! Glacier Peak looms above a meadow of lupine. Now the hike gets fun. Continue down the trail, being aware of marmots that have taken up residence right in the tread. Undulating between forest and meadow, the way carries on, skirting around a knoll and charging up another one.From this 5525-foot bump on the ridge, catch your breath and enjoy the amazing view of Glacier Peak hovering over the emerald lawns of Kodak Peak. The trail then steeply drops about 100 feet and turns directly west, traversing an open side slope with spectacular views south to Nason Ridge, Mount Daniel, and the Chiwaukums. The tread here is slumping, so watch your ankles.Cresting a 5550-foot shoulder of Cady Ridge, the trail continues for another mile through some of the finest alpine meadows this side of the Colorado Rockies. Aside from the myriad blossoms vying for your attention, hundreds of peaks demand recognition as well. Scan the Cascade crest south to Grizzly, Fortune, Benchmark, and Skykomish. Look east to the lofty Poets and north to the 10,568-foot glacial giant known to the area's first peoples as Dahkobed, ""the white mountain.""The trail drops to a small saddle with a sometimes-flowing spring and then makes a short, quick climb before terminating at the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) (elev. 5350 ft), 6.5 miles from where you began.

The forest-lined and grassy-shored body of water is a peaceful spot, but in early summer hordes of voracious mosquitoes will keep you moving.

A great hike for late spring, late fall, or lazy summer days, the upper Icicle invites outdoor adventurers of all levels.In an impressive grove of towering cottonwoods, ancient western cedars, and gigantic Engelmann spruce, the wide and well-trodden path begins its upriver journey.

Traversing grove after grove of ancient giants and passing one gurgling creek after another, the way lethargically delves deeper into the wilderness. At about 1.5 miles notice a change in forest cover as lodgepole pine replaces spruce, fir, and cedar. Notice too that the creek is more audible. The reason is soon revealed as a pretty set of small falls comes into view. Here, just below the confluence with French Creek, is one of the most popular backcountry sites in the Icicle Valley, a perfect spot to call it a day if hiking with young children. Seek out sunning, snacking, soaking, and snoozing spots.Beyond the falls and its busy campsites, cross French Creek (elev. 2900 ft) on a big bridge and come to a junction with the French Creek Trail shortly afterward. The way now hugs the Icicle, revealing some appealing swimming holes. At 1.9 miles the French Ridge Trail takes off left. To the right, Spanish Camp Creek, named for Basque sheepherders who once worked the Chiwaukum high country, tumbles into the Icicle.Across lush flats the trail continues its easy way up the wilderness valley. At about 2.6 miles Frosty Creek adds its chilly waters to the Icicle. At about 4 miles the trail pulls away from the creek in a wide bottomland. With the river's babbling farther in the distance, listen now to soothing melodies from thrushes, wrens, warblers, and flycatchers.At 5 miles come to a bridge spanning the Icicle just before a junction with the trail to Frosty Pass (elev. 3200 ft).

Easily reached from High Camp, Julius and Eileen extend a hearty faiilte to all hikers, young and old alike.From High Camp take the Summer Trail, which takes off from behind the main lodge and immediately enters national forest land. Come to a junction with the Sunset Trail at 0.2 mile and continue right. Through cool forest, the Summer Trail quickly gains elevation. At 0.5 mile veer right onto the Low Road Trail and follow it for 0.5 mile to its end at the McCue Ridge Trail (elev. 5600 ft). Left heads up and over McCue to Chiwaukum and Larch lakes. Go right.Soon come to a signed junction. The way right is the old Roaring Creek Trail that once traveled for miles through unbroken forest to the Nason Creek valley. It became a logging casualty in the 1980s. Continue left through pleasant old growth. Cross a small creek and slowly descend, coming to the end of a logging road at 1.75 miles (elev. 5350 ft). The logging road offers a 1.5-mile, slightly easier alternative route back to High Camp.The trail veers back into the forest, where it continues to descend. Soon after entering the Alpine Lakes Wilderness, the way bottoms out along Roaring Creek, which lets out nary a growl here within a peaceful flat (elev. 5150 ft). After carefully crossing the creek on a set of logs that shift each year, reach a junction. The trail right leads 2.5 lonely and scenic miles to Lake Ethel.Take the more boot-beaten path left, reaching Lake Julius (elev. 5200 ft) in a mere 0.25 mile (2.5 miles from your start). A shallow lake ringed with handsome forest and a rugged backdrop of McCue Ridge, it's a pleasant destination for picnicking or for calling it a day. If intent on seeing Eileen, however, continue. Skirt Julius's shoreline, and then climb a series of ledges to reach the bowl-bound Loch Eileen at 3.5 miles (elev. 5508 ft).Fed by waterfalls tumbling over steep headwalls and surrounded by rocky slopes and groves of larches, Eileen sits in a dramatically different environment than its lower cousin Julius. Particularly striking in autumn, Eileen also has a nice appeal during hot summer days, when shoreline ledges invite foot-soaking."

Remote and breathtakingly beautiful, getting there is quite a jaunt. It requires a slog up and over McCue Ridge and an up-and-over McCue slog again on the return. But the sweeping alpine views . . . and big, shimmering Chiwaukum Lake . . . and wide-open Ewing Basin along the way all help ease the pain.Locate the Summer Trail that takes off from behind the main lodge at High Camp. Built by camp staff, the trail is a nice forested connection to the McCue Ridge Trail. Immediately enter national forest land. At 0.2 mile, just after crossing a creek, come to a junction with the Sunset Trail. Another High Camp-built trail, Sunset offers a longer and more scenic alternative to McCue Ridge.Winding through cool forest, the Summer Trail quickly gains elevation. At 0.5 mile veer right onto the Low Road Trail and follow it for 0.5 mile to its end at the McCue Ridge Trail (elev. 5600 ft). Right heads to the famed Scottish Lakes (Hikes 47 and 50). Hang a left instead, ascending McCue Ridge (elev. 5950 ft) and entering the Alpine Lakes Wilderness. The forest thins and good views of the Chiwaukums and Big Jim Mountain are to be had from this long broad ridge once used as pasture for William McCue's sheep flocks.After ambling easily along the ridge, begin a long descent, dropping 700 feet to a junction on the wooded shores of Chiwaukum Lake (elev. 5250 ft). One mile long and perched at the head of a hanging valley, the lake is a favorite destination for backpackers, anglers, and day hikers abandoning plans to pursue Larch Lake.For the Larch-bound, carry on to the right, entering the stunning Ewing Basin in a short mile. The word Chiwaukum is derived from the Wenatchee dialect meaning ""many little creeks running into one big one."" Look around-a most appropriate name indeed for these mountains. After rock-hopping over a couple of those creeks, leave the basin to climb a small rib rife with larch.At 6 miles enter a glorious high meadow spread out before sparkling Larch Lake (elev. 6078 ft). Beautiful in summer, the lake and its environs are resplendent in autumn when low-lying blueberry bushes carpet the basin crimson and crag-clinging larches illuminate it with a golden glow."

Easy to reach, Lake Janus beckons its fair share of anglers and beginning backpackers, while Grizzly's bear of a distance culls all but the strongest hikers. Those who do push on, however, will be rewarded with continuous panoramic viewing, all while under the watchful guise of majestic snow- and ice-crowned Glacier Peak.Start by following the well-groomed delight-to-hike Smith Brook Trail for 1 mile, coming to a junction with the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) at 4700-foot Union Gap. Left, the PCT heads south to Lake Valhalla and Mexico. Head right instead toward Janus, Grizzly, and Canada. Avoiding Union Peak's steep boulder-bound slopes, the trail descends, losing 700 feet in about a mile.Skirt boggy meadows, with glimpses down into the Rapid River valley, then begin climbing again. After traversing a brushy boulder field, cross a small creek beneath a little cascade and emerge onto a forested flat that harbors patches of blueberries. Lake Janus lies just ahead: find a short spur trail leading to the right to its grassy and welcoming shores. Children will enjoy tadpole tallying while you'll enjoy soaking your tootsies in the warm, shallow waters. Cast a lure into the emerald meadows of Jove Peak that are reflected on the placid lake surface.The 3.25-mile hike to Janus is satisfying to most people, but if you came for maximum viewing and aerobic exercise, carry on. Continue north on the PCT, rock-hopping across Janus's outlet creek. Be sure water bottles are filled here, for beyond, the life-sustaining liquid isn't always readily available.Climbing steadily but gently, the way weaves back and forth in pursuit of the Cascade crest. About 1 mile from the lake, arrive at a heathered swale complete with campsites along a sometimes flowing creek. A 5650-foot open knoll just to the west makes a good viewing and quitting spot. Otherwise carry on, reaching a 5200-foot gap in another 0.5 mile with a mouthwatering preview of the spectacular alpine scenery lying ahead. Bust out of the forest into a granite sculpture garden. Views! Labyrinth, Poet Ridge, and the White Mountains vie for your attention to the east. But the snowy volcanic monolith that is Glacier Peak, Washington's fourth-loftiest summit, draws and holds your gaze northward.In 0.5 mile beyond the gap, an overhanging ledge offers clear viewing straight down to Glasses Lake. A little farther, gaps in the forest reveal little Margaret Lake lying beneath the west side of the crest. After a slight drop, reach a 5000-foot low point where two steep, boot-beaten side paths take off for those lakes.Now gently climbing again, the trail hugs the west side of the Cascade crest, revealing nice glimpses of Mounts Hinman and Daniel. Undulating between sun-kissed heather meadows and cool groves of mountain hemlock, the trail continues along the vibrant vertebrae of Washington State.Perched in a wide cirque 1200 feet below, Heather Lake comes into view. Against an emerald backdrop with Glacier Peak hovering above, the shimmering backcountry lake looks stunning from high above. Using switchbacks, the trail then climbs steeply up open slopes, providing striking views southward all the way to Rainier.Finally, after 8 long but scenically satisfying miles, reach the unassuming 5597-foot summit of Grizzly Peak. A carpet of flowering meadows unrolls northward and entices you to keep going all the way to Glacier Peak. But your tired calves and better judgment lead you instead to lie back in the soft grasses and contemplate the beauty before you. And here in the heart of the Henry M. Jackson Wilderness it's bountiful."

It's one of the finest tracts of old growth along the US 2 corridor.Begin by walking a short distance up a powerline service road. In 0.2 mile turn left onto real trail, and real nice trail at that. On good tread, sturdy stairs, and solid planking, head up the narrow Surprise Creek valley through a magnificent forest of ancient cedars and giant hemlocks. Soon enter the Alpine Lakes Wilderness, its designation guaranteeing that those giant arboreal elders' lives won't be cut short.At about 1.3 miles the trail crosses cascading Surprise Creek on a big log. Note previous log crossings strewn about in the creek's bed. Then skirt beneath avalanche slopes and undulate between patches of brush and groves of majestic primeval forest as the trail continues upvalley. Tumbling Surprise Creek, always nearby, provides constant visual and audio delights.At about 3 miles begin climbing more steeply. At 4.5 miles, after winding around talus and ascending steep forested slopes, reach a trail junction just shy of Surprise Lake. The trail left climbs briskly toward Trap Pass to connect with the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT). Continue right, traversing a marshy meadow and a precarious creek crossing to reach Surprise Lake.A popular backpacking destination with its numerous designated campsites, the lake is well-loved by day hikers too. Treat it well. Find a quiet shoreline ledge or boulder to soak rays or feet. While away the afternoon here, or continue farther to bigger and prettier Glacier Lake by continuing south along the trail, climbing a rib between Surprise Lake on the right and a cascading creek on the left.About 0.5 mile beyond Surprise Lake, reach a junction with the PCT (elev. 4900 ft). Left goes to Trap Pass. Continue straight. Come to a big granite talus slope just after passing a tarn tucked below on the left. Locate an unmarked but obvious trail heading right. Take it, passing an old Snoqualmie National Forest sign and dropping steeply 50 feet or so to granite-bound Glacier Lake (elev. 4800 ft).No glaciers, lots of granite, this lake along with Surprise are also known as the Scenic Lakes. Can't argue with that moniker."

Come in late spring for showy blossoms brightening the forest floor, summer for languid lounging, or fall for berry picking amid pockets of vivid color. And with its short distance, the hike around Elizabeth is ideal for budding explorers.The way is pretty straightforward. From the trailhead, drop a few feet to the lake's outlet, Money Creek, and decide your course of circumnavigation. Left or right around the lake? Either way, it's a delightful hike. Aside from constantly having the tranquil 7-acre lake at your side, you'll pass through lovely groves of old cedar, fir, and hemlock, and cross numerous feeder creeks. You'll be granted nice views, too, of the steep, open slopes surrounding Elizabeth.The only difficulty you may encounter is that this trail, like so many others in the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest, is slowly deteriorating due to lack of maintenance. The bridge over Money Creek is in need of capital improvements and the trail is brushing-in at many spots. After your hike, let the forest ranger and your representative in Congress know about the trail's condition and why it's a shame to let such a recreational treasure wither away. Better yet, invite them out to see it for themselves-it'll do them some good and hopefully the trail too!"

But, while many of the nearby lakes often swirl in activity, Craters' environs generally remain calm. Hikers are few, horses rare, motorcycles barred. Come here in October when golden larches light up the steep valley walls and you'll swear you found the pearly gates.Why the Crater Lakes and a dozen other nearby alpine lakes were ever left out of the Lake Chelan-Sawtooth Wilderness is beyond me. This is some of the finest backcountry east of the Cascade crest. Ecologically rich and graced with interconnecting trails, the Golden Lakes (a name given to this region by guidebook pioneers Harvey Manning and Ira Spring) should be a hiker's heaven. Instead, the Forest Service allowed motorized recreation in this region. Motorcyclists do indeed have a right to recreate on our public lands, but not on these lands may not be an apporiate location. The Golden Lakes are far too fragile and far too valuable for wildlife and passive recreation to be a backcountry speedway.Fortunately, motorcycles are prohibited on the Crater Lakes Trail. But you'll have to first endure 0.7 mile of dust and throttle on Eagle Lakes Trail No. 431. Beginning in open forest, the wide throughway gently climbs. In 0.25 mile stop and admire views over the Crater Creek drainage.

Immediately getting down to business, the trail climbs steeply up the narrow Crater Creek valley. At 1.25 miles from your start, cross the creek again and take a break before resuming your climb. Reach an outcropping and take another break, enjoying a good view east out to the Methow Valley sizzling in the sun. Start climbing again up more steep terrain.At 4 miles rejoice as you enter a basin walled in by 8000-foot peaks. Lower Crater Lake (elev. 6814 ft) unfolds before you. Relax. As pretty as this lake is, Upper Crater is far more attractive. Recharge. Then work your way left (south) along the lakeshore to reach an inlet creek.

But its outlet is graced with rows of stately larches. In summer their delicate needles add soft green streaks to the barren basin, while in autumn their golden transformation adds light. It's a stiff climb, best attempted early to beat the Okanogan sun.Trail No. 415 starts in an old cut. A few remnant ponderosas still stand, and swaying grasses and quaking aspens adorn the stumps. The trail wastes little time in attacking the ridge in front of it, steadily gaining elevation. In early summer, boughs of balsamroot turn the open southern slope a sunny yellow. In the distance, Hoodoo Peak's hood peeks above the Libby Creek valley.After about 1 mile of stiff climbing, crest the ridge and enjoy a bit of level hiking. In 0.5 mile you'll enter the Lake Chelan-Sawtooth Wilderness in a forest of lodgepole pine punctuated with granite glacial erratics. This is classic Okanogan Highlands topography. More stiff climbing ensues, than a slight descent as the trail crosses Libby Creek at about 2.5 miles (elev. 5800 ft).Now in cool forest and across bogs and granite slabs, the trail works its way into a broad basin.

The real allure of this trail is the impressive old-growth forest it traverses, compensating for any lake letdown.The trail starts right beside Pyramid Creek. Catch its cool breezes, and then immediately get to work climbing. Under a thin canopy of lodgepole pine, work your way up a ledge. It's slow going, with roots, loose rocks, and tread-choking salal. Hang in there-it gets better.Marching up a rib above the crashing creek, periodically peer over your shoulder through the sparse forest cover for glimpses of Davis Peak and Sourdough Mountain across the Skagit Valley. After about 1 mile the pine and fir forest transitions to mature hemlocks. Come to a branch of Pyramid Creek (elev. 1700 ft) and hop across it to a beautiful cedar grove.Now alongside the babbling waterway, continue climbing. Towering ancient cedars and Douglas-fir soon humble your stature. Make one final grunt, crossing the babbling creek once more to arrive at puny Pyramid Lake shortly afterward. Not much, huh? Actually, there is if you look at this body of water through ecological instead of aesthetic eyes. Rough-skinned newts, those adorable amphibians of the Northwest, thrive here. Look for them floating near the surface and hiding in the detritus. And those big ol' logs floating in the lake harbor scads of sundew, a carnivorous plant. No need for you or the newts to worry, though-they prefer insects.If after observing some of nature's fascinating creations, you still desire a view, try wiggling around the lakeshore a bit and you may catch a glimpse or two of not-so-puny Pyramid Peak poking out above."

Gaze out to salty waters or deep into the heart of the North Cascades wilderness. And best of all, you wont' be competing for space on the summit. The crowds are over at nearby Hannegan Peak. Starting in thick forest decorated with mossy boulders, the way immediately winds upward. On excellent tread the grade is mostly moderate - but trust me, it'll get steeper. Much of Goat Mountain succumbed to fire nearly a half century ago, and blackened snags bear witness to the past conflagration.At about 1.75 miles enter the Mount Baker Wilderness. Shortly afterward pass an unmarked side trail (elev. 3900 ft) that heads right. It leads 0.5 mile to an old lookout site. The view is good, but the ones waiting for you along the main trail are better. Far better. So continue climbing. Thick forest cover soon thins, replaced by a jungle of mountain ash, maple, alder and willow. Then the surrounding walls of shrubbery begin to dissipate, yielding to low-lying blueberry bushes and expanding views.At about 3.75 miles arrive on a 5100 foot knoll with a knockout view of glacier-harboring Mount Sefrit and Shuksan. From this good early turnaround option (or early season objective), you'll also find an excellent shot of glistening Price Lake tucked in a high cirque on Shuksan's northern face of ice and rock.The trail continues along the spine of a ridge, officially terminating at 5600 feet at the base of expansive meadows high on Goat's south-facing slopes. From here follow a rough but well-defined route, first across, then straight up those flower-studded steep slopes. Cross a couple of spring-fed creeks adorned with showy bouquets. The way here is prone to slumping, so travel carefully. After a long traverse the trail insanely heads straight up the verdant slope, reaching a 6250-foot shoulder and an amazing view north to Tomyhoi, the High Divide, and British Columbia's infinite summits.Now turn right and follow a ridgeline course, reaching a 6650-foot high point after 0.5 mile of some of the most incredible alpine viewing in the North Cascades. Look at all those peaks: Redoubt, Jack, Ruth, Blum, Triumph and Whitehorse among them, and Slesse, Rexford and Silver Tip among their Canadian cousins.Don't forget to admire your immediate surroundings too, like the small glacier directly below wedged between Goat's two prominent summits.

A great conditioner and good choice for solitude, if you're feeling energetic, follow this steer-way to heaven all the way to the rocky Helen Buttes for even grander views.Trail No. 763 starts low, but aims high. From its valley-bottom beginning to its alpine destination, 4000 feet of elevation is gained-in less than 5 miles. These stats keep more than a handful of aerobically challenged hikers away. But despite this trail's lonely state, it's in fine shape. The tread is fairly smooth and the way is well defined.Begin in cool cedar forest on new trail rerouted around private land. Soon after crossing a creek in a mossy grotto, the trail gets down to business. Following tight switchbacks, the way vigorously climbs up a near-vertical slope. The forest canopy is dense, mostly a uniform stand of second-growth conifers. A handful of vine maples punctuate it, lightening the dark understory during the autumn months.After 1 mile recross the creek you hopped over earlier. Now in scrappy forest and alongside the cascading creek, continue climbing. Cross the creek yet again. The forest soon thins, offering glimpses to the jumbled array of peaks across the Skagit Valley.Just after 2 miles the trail briefly drops to traverse a dank mossy hollow supporting a handful of mammoth cedars, and then the trail picks up the pace again. Lighter tread and a few gullied sections help keep your pace in check. After passing a series of boulders and overhanging ledges, the trail enters a grove of impressive old growth.Eventually the forest thins, yellow cedars and subalpine firs indicating that much elevation has thus far been gained. After 4 miles and at about 4000 feet, finally break out of the canopy. Views begin to unravel across huckleberry-choked slopes that were scorched many decades ago by wildfire. Continue across the brushy terrain, coming to a small meadow with a small tarn.For better panoramic viewing, find a faint path heading northwest up an open rib. Here in the heart of Cow Heaven, steak your viewing spot! The deep U-shaped Skagit Valley unfurls below you. Craggy Colonial Peak and the Teebone Ridge (seriously) tower above it. Jack is the big guy on the western horizon. The Newhalem powerhouse is the big structure below. Turn south to take in a sweeping view of the Cascade River valley. Snowking Mountain, the Illabot Peaks, Whitehorse Mountain, and the Finney Block area fill the southern horizon.The Helen Buttes obstruct views northward and eastward. But if your scrambling and orientation skills are good, continue toward the buttes, where you can graze on more mouthwatering views. Contemplate, too, just how tenacious those cows must have been to hoof it all the way to this lonely and heavenly range."

On this trail you can propel yourself back in time to when it took time to reach coveted summits and high ridges. But more than mere time is required for this trek; you'll also need excellent endurance and a good cardiovascular system.Starting under a glorious canopy of ancient Douglas-fir, the trail begins its long and winding way up the mountain. While the grade is good and the tread intact, undergrowth is encroaching upon this trail that receives little maintenance. (Actually, in these days of budgetary neglect, most of our trails receive little maintenance - a national shame.)The trail alternates between short switchbacks and long traverses as it works its way up the broad mile-high peak.

While this assures an easy grade, look forward to a hot slog when the sun is beating down-there's no shade. When trees do begin to reclaim the roadbed and fringes, alders are the colonizers. If not cut back on a regular basis, the way can quickly take on a jungle ambience. Be forewarned.

Lacking the wonderful trails that now grace the region, O'Neil and company cut a mule trail up the North Fork Skokomish River to help transport supplies to base camps along the way.

Carey and Holder creeks support spawning coho salmon.There are excellent views of Mount Rainier from the Holder Knob Trail. Public access to the Cedar River Watershed is allowed on the Elk Ridge Trail. Taylor Mountain Forest is located south and east of Tiger Mountain, south of I-90 and east of SR-18, between the communities of Hobart and North Bend in eastern King County. The 1,822-acre site, which offers sweeping views of Mount Rainier, forested wetlands and meadows of wildflowers, provides an important habitat link between the City of Seattle’s Cedar River Watershed and Tiger Mountain State Forest.WTA volunteers have worked hard clearing downed branches and trees from the trails and roads in this area. It is an easy hike, but mud can make it a bit more challenging. After enjoying the great view from Holder Knob, with Mount Rainier gleaming in the sun, head down the way you came."

Then, enjoy an easy return hike winding through shady forest and crusty lava formations.Before you go, make sure everyone in your party is aware of the restrictions and conditions: No food, pets, smoking, or rock collecting. Do not touch the walls, which harbor cave “slime”, a food source in the cave’s delicate ecosystem. The temperature is a constant 42 degrees F. The ceilings are drippy, and there may be puddles. Bring 2 or 3 light sources and spare batteries. No cave can ever be considered completely safe. A short distance from the parking lot, enter the large cave entrance and descend two staircases to the floor of the cave and the signed junction between Upper and Lower. The data listed above for mileage and elevation gain exclude the lower cave, combining only the upper cave and the return trail. You may find that you hike more miles if you explore the Lower Cave as well. Head into the Upper Cave. It's a 1.5 rugged miles one way, requiring significantly more time, caution, and some physical agility. It is a more interesting route though, with the lava tube shape, size, and geology changing frequently. Not far from the staircase, the passage encounters its first of many rock piles. You must climb up, over, or around the abrasive rocks, taking care not to twist an ankle or, in some places, bump your head.At about 0.8 mile is the narrowest part of the passage, and the crux move: a slick, wet, 8-foot lava fall. Some people need assistance scaling it, as there is only one significant foothold.Beyond the lava fall are a couple of rock formations that require some physical ability to climb over or to squeeze around. Then at about 1.2 miles is the Skylight, a hole in the ceiling which allows in the first natural light since the entrance. The Skylight is neither a safe nor legal exit.The affixed metal ladder at about 1.4 miles is the Upper Entrance, and your exit. You may choose to continue the final 500 feet beyond to the natural end of the lava tube. The ceiling is only about 6 feet high in places, so take care. Then retrace your steps to the ladder and head up topside.The return trail is marked for travel in snow. Simply follow the blue diamond markers affixed high on tree trunks. When snow not present, keep an eye out for other small caves and pockmarks in the rough lava. The trail drops gently the 1.3 miles back to the Main Entrance.If the Upper Cave is a bit too rugged for you, consider exploring the Lower Cave. It's a broad lava tube that descends gently to its end. The floor is flat (though a bit uneven at first), then sandy later on, from a mud flow that filled the lower portion centuries ago. The end of the cave now is where the sand has filled in to within a couple feet of the ceiling. The Lower Cave is an easy walk, for a 1.5 mile round trip, that houses a popular geologic anomaly known as the Meatball.Note: Some people hike the trail uphill, then enter the cave via the Upper Entrance. There are two concerns about this: Firstly, the lava fall is easier to ascend than to descend safely. Additionally, from the main entrance, you immediately experience climbing over and around rock piles, enabling you to decide whether the Upper Cave is more than you wish to attempt.WTA Pro Tip: At 13,042 feet long (about 2.4 miles), Ape Cave is the third longest lava tube in North America. It is sometimes referred to as Ape Caves (plural) because the main entrance is between its two ends, referred to as the Lower Cave and Upper Cave.Ape Cave was formed nearly 2000 years ago from lava streaming down the southern flank of Mount St. Helens. As the outer edges cooled into a hardened crust, the inner molten lava was able to drain away before it hardened, leaving behind a tube. After discovering the cave in approximately 1950, a logger told his spelunker friend. That friend explored the cave with his sons and their friends, who called themselves the Mount St. Helens Apes. Thus the name of the cave."

You can even make this a thru-hike if you can arrange a pick-up at the other end. If you're coming from the Middle Fork Road, drive to the end and park at the Snoqualmie Lake Trailhead, 12 miles from the beginning of the Middle Fork Snoqualmie Road. Start from the small parking area and admire the wide Taylor River as you cross a paved bridge. Pass a couple of dispersed camping sites and come to a junction with the Quartz Creek trail branching off to the left at about 0.5 miles. Take the right fork, staying on a relatively flat, rocky trail that heads through quiet forest. Moss-laden birches, western redcedars, and western hemlocks tower over you. Along the trail, Taylor River rushes past you, and craggy Garfield Peak plays hide-and-seek through the trees. Near a creek crossing, the forest opens up, offering hikers a glimpse of a spire of Treen Peak.6.5 miles from the parking area for this trailhead, arrive at a fork.

Continue along the side of the river valley, crossing several feeder creeks and waterfalls, before arriving at a campsite on the northern shores of Snoqualmie Lake. If you've decided to approach from Highway 2, you'll find the trail generally in good condition, with many sections stabilized by carefully-assembled log cribs. It's about 1.9 miles to Lake Dorothy, with an 800 foot elevation gain. From there, head to Bear Lake. Here, the trail begins to climb along the hillside, taking you above the lake. You'll gain 700 feet in 1.6 miles, on sometimes rough trail to reach the pass to Bear Lake. But the way is eased by occasional enjoyable views down to Lake Dorothy.A short way beyond the pass Bear Lake can be seen glinting through the trees. It's a half-mile with a drop of 200 feet to get down to the western shore of the lake. Deer Lake is not far away. It's only 30 feet lower than Bear Lake, and at one point along the trail, bits of both lakes will be visible through the trees.Once you've made it around the southern shores of Deer Lake, Snoqualmie Lake is just under a mile away. There is a campsite just before you arrive at the lake, but if you want to be on the lake, press on to the one lying on the north shore of the large, quiet lake."

Lock up your bike if you brought it, as it is permitted only on the road. A sign indicates that this trail is not maintained due to numerous washouts in recent years; however, it is still navigable thanks to markers and cairns leading the way. Hike up the trail for 2.1 miles, pass a small waterfall and join the Wonderland Trail.Head north on the Wonderland on a gentle, forested ascent.  The trail turns from dust to pebbles, and the scenery moves from forest to volcanic and subalpine terrain. As you approach Emerald Ridge you’ll discover the reason for its name—the wildflowers and grasses make this high alpine meadow a vision in green and offer visitors a wonderful packs-off opportunity to sit and take it all in. Aster, harebell and western anemone thrive in the volcanic earth, while the odd view of The Mountain from this angle makes it seem decrepit, fragile and ancient.  The descent from Emerald Ridge is arguably the loosest rock footing on the whole trail, so go slow and use caution. In the next 1.5 miles the volcanic rock gives way to more forested canopy. Turn west on the South Puyallup Trail, watching for some interesting andesite columns, named the Colonnades. Continue descending through shrubs and thimbleberry, choreographed to the rumbling song of the South Puyallup River. At the next junction divert onto the Round Pass Trail and climb through woods for 0.6 mile to reach the Westside Road and the top of Round Pass. Spot a stone memorial dedicated to a group of Marines whose plane went down on South Tahoma Glacier. Turn south on the road for the 2-mile descent to the Tahoma Creek Trail, grab your bike or walk back to your vehicle, and celebrate a wonderful day!

Believed to be the first park in the United States to be co-owned and managed by a tribe and another government, management of the area focuses on conservation and research, public education and limited recreational use, including hiking!The preserve includes 84 acres on Kiket Island and Flagstaff Point and 9 acres on Fidalgo Island, all of which are located within the Swinomish Reservation. Here, cattail mats were once used as temporary summer shelters by the local tribe during clam digs and salmon seining. More than 2 miles of shoreline play host to native eelgrass beds, multiple fish species and shellfish. The preserve's diverse land habitats also house several endangered or threatened species, and a ""rocky bald"" -- an area with fragile, thin soil -- provides land for yet more native plants and waterfowl. The fragility of the land on the rocky bald dictates that access to Flagstaff Point be prohibited to protect the unique life that inhabits this area. But there are opportunities for hikers to enjoy this area. Two miles of walking trails currently exist, with plans to add an ADA-accessible boardwalk, another trail and amenities such as a picnic shelter, picnic sites, interpretive information and two vault restrooms.Start your exploration from the parking area by taking the gravel Kiket Trail as it crosses a tombolo (a sand spit connecting an island to the mainland) to Kiket Island. Pass Kiket Lagoon and look northwest to Fidalgo Island, where Mount Erie looms in the distance. The Kiket Trail bisects Kiket Island and is the most direct route to Kiket's west side. For a lollipop loop, follow this road to a signed intersection and turn right for the North Trail. The singletrack North Trail has some elevation gain but is gentle enough for young hikers. At its high point, a meadow overlook provides views of Deception Pass Bridge, framed by madrona boughs and old growth. From here the trail descends to a large meadow at the west end of Kiket Island, meeting up once more with the Kiket Trail. Continue west to find a second tombolo leading out to Flagstaff Point. This shoreline offers windswept views of Skagit and Hope Islands, as well as Similk Bay.Home to a delicate meadow ecosystem, Flagstaff Point was—amazingly—formerly proposed as the site of a nuclear power plant by Seattle City Light. Head back along the gentle South Trail, peeking out at tiny High Tide Island's single tree from meadow balds.

The trail drops down close to the beach before heading up again. There is a side trail to the left, but that is not your trail, take the one to the right that heads uphill. Hike along an open, grassy area on a rocky hillside, in spring look for the pink flowers of wild currant. Look out at Cornet Bay and on a sunny day, Mount Baker in the distance. All along this section notice the contorted branches and peeling red bark of the native madrone trees. These will have clusters of flowers in the spring, and red-orange berries in the fall. Some of these trees are quite old, with huge trunks and grey bark at the base. The trail drops down to a well signed intersection. Here you meet the Summit Trail. Take this one; it’s time to head to the top! The trail climbs steeply, then switchbacks through the woods. Climb out of the trees and hit the first of what is called ‘the Balds’. Bald refers to an area scraped to the bedrock by receding glaciers at the end of the last ice age. A good look at the rock and you can see the striations. It has taken thousands of years to build up enough topsoil on top of the rock to grow the plants in this meadow. Get down on your knees and look carefully, see how many different kinds of mosses, stonecrops and other plants you can find!  Please don’t destroy them by careless walking. Follow the path, and head up and under the power lines. Here will be some great views of the Cascade peaks along the Mountain Loop Highway. From here, you can follow a trail over to the high point and the top of Goose Rock at 484 feet. From the top you can see the Olympics, across the water to the San Juan Islands, and just below you, Cranberry Lake. Check out the view of the Naval Air Station and watch the jets on maneuvers.When you are ready to head back, you have several routes to choose from. Take the Summit trail back to the start of the Perimeter trail and the bridge, or go back the way you came up, and hit the Discovery trail, cross Highway 20 by going under a pedestrian tunnel, and meet the North Beach trail on the other side of the bridge. From the North Beach trail, drop down to the beach and walk along the beach. There are picnic tables scattered about where beach meets woods. If the tide is out, you may be able to walk all the way back to the parking lot by way of the beach. If it is in, you will reach a dead end at the west point headland, backtrack and catch the trail again. WTA Pro Tip: This is a very popular park and the trails are well used. For maximum enjoyment, get here early! The park hours are: 6:30 AM-dusk April through September, 8:00 AM-dusk October-March."

Turn right and continue your uphill trek. Soon you will be treated to glimpses of the Columbia River through the foliage. During the spring, you may also come face-to-face with wildflowers on the hillside next to the trail. One mile past the junction, the trail comes to a viewpoint where you get a panoramic view of the Columbia River, Wind Mountain, and the top of Dog Mountain. This makes a good picnic spot and turnaround point for a shorter hike. After enjoying the viewpoint, resume your uphill ascent for a half-mile to the second trail junction. Bear right and head up another half-mile to the site of a former fire lookout. The lookout was built in 1931 to watch for fires across the river in the Mount Hood National Forest. The wide openness makes this an excellent spot to pause and take in the scenery.From the lookout, it is only a half mile to the top of the meadow. This portion of the hike is out in the open and very picturesque. However, you’ll need to turn your focus from the scenery to your feet as you skirt the top of a cliff. It can also be quite breezy, so be prepared for gusty winds.Getting to the top is a cause for celebration, and you may be greeted by a swarm of people buzzing with excitement after having made the rigorous climb. This is not a spot for quiet introspection. Instead, join the party-like atmosphere and savor the view. Retrace your steps to return to the car. You can also make this a loop hike by coming back down the Augspurger Mountain Trail. This adds 0.9 miles to the hike, but is more knee-friendly and provides additional views of the Columbia River.  A tenth of a mile down from the top of the meadow, take the trail to the right. Continue for 1.1 miles to a junction. Turn left and follow the trail 2.7 miles back to your car. WTA Pro-Tip: The perfect way to end your Dog Mountain experience is to stop in Stevenson Washington at the Walking Man Brewery or the Big River Grill. The Walking Man Brewery serves a wide variety of their own brews along with sandwiches and gourmet pizzas, and the outdoor seating area allows you to continue your commune with nature.

From the trailhead just off Weikel Road, you’ll wind beneath steep sagebrush slopes and cliffs of basalt and andesite splotched with colorful lichens, crossing Cowiche Creek numerous times along the way. The creek is always close at hand, and the lush riparian vegetation and sagebrush hillsides are home to numerous species of songbirds, while raptors and vultures circle above the cliffs. If you’re lucky, you’ll hear a canyon wren or spot a yellow-bellied marmot or a lucia azure butterfly. In the spring, a wide array of wildflowers dot the hillsides.As you make your way down the canyon, just past bridge 5 you’ll come upon some reddish basalt columns reminiscent of the statues on Easter Island. A little farther along, soaring above the trail between bridges 7 and 8, is an andesite formation known as the Mayan Sunrise. Just prior to bridge 8 is a junction with the Winery Trail, which climbs the north side of the canyon to the Wilridge Vineyard and the Tasting Room of Yakima, while just beyond bridge 8 is a junction with the Uplands Trail that climbs the south side of the canyon to the uplands with broad vistas of Mount Cleman, Cowiche Mountain, and the surrounding countryside.Beyond here the main trail leaves the railroad bed and follows an old county road to bypass two trestles that were illegally removed when the rails and ties were salvaged. Here the vegetation crowds the trail, at times almost forming a tunnel as the trail follows a bend in the creek back to the railroad bed below some impressive basalt cliffs. After crossing the creek for a final time, the trail passes a grove of aspen, then a house and small orchard. Beyond this is the hop yard that is the source of Fremont Brewing’s Cowiche Canyon Fresh Hop Ale, and finally the trailhead at the end of Cowiche Canyon Road."

A short, steep trail leads to the functioning fire lookout as well as magnificent 360 degree views of the Stuart Range, Teanaway Ridge, Chelan and Entiat Mountains, Mount Rainier, and even Mount Adams on a clear day.Start your hike from the parking lot, continuing up the dirt road. Spot Red Top Lookout perched on Teanaway Ridge above you, and continue up the path and over a dirt mound to the trail ahead. Enter a shaded forest and come upon a sign for the Teanaway Ridge Trail. Turn left here and start your 0.5 mile climb to the lookout.  The trail is steep, but short and easy to follow. Catch your breath by admiring the variety of wildflowers lining the trail such as the tiny white flowers of the common yarrow and the pretty purple petals of the aster. Look up to Mount Rainier as it slowly peeks out from the southwest.  Breaking out of the forest, you soon reach an exposed, rocky ridge and Red Top Lookout. The Stuart Range and Teanaway Ridge spread before you to the north, the Chelan and Entiat Mountains to the northeast, and South Cle Elum, Mount Adams and Mount Rainier to the southwest. Spot a large solar panel to the immediate north of the lookout. The panel powers a radio repeater that transmits radio signals over the rugged terrain.If the lookout is open, take the time to examine the many resources inside. Take a look at the panoramic map nailed on one of the walls and see how many peaks you can identify. Check out the large, compass-like device in the center of the lookout called an Osbourne Firefinder. This tool helps lookout volunteers pinpoint the location of a distant fire, which they can then relay to the Central Washington Interagency Communication Center. The lookout is typically staffed by volunteers in the summer months and is generally open to visitors from 9:00 a.m. – 6:00 p.m. It is locked if a volunteer is not there, so if you'd like to look around inside, try to time your visit for a summer weekend when a volunteer is more likely to be there. You can walk a bit beyond the lookout on a short ridge about 50 feet long for further views. This section, and the area surrounding the lookout is surrounded by steep dropoffs and rocks that are easy to slip on; exercise caution with children and those who might need a helping hand.Extending your Hike: Make it a loop! Instead of descending back the way you came, hike north from the lookout towards the big rock at the end of the ridge. Bear right at a fork in the trail and continue down the switchbacks. The trail continues to descend steeply, and in about 0.2 miles arrive at a junction with a sign marked Teanaway Ridge Trail 1364 nailed to a tree. Turn right to head back to the parking lot. The trail here is gently rolling with a couple of narrow, rocky sections and steep drop-offs; so exercise caution. This route is slightly longer than the 0.5 mile route, clocking in at about 0.65 miles, meaning the loop is about 1.05 miles total. WTA Pro Tip: Red Top Lookout and the trail to it is a popular place to find agates and thunder eggs. Starting at the trailhead, continue up the dirt road for about 0.2 miles, until you reach the Teanaway Ridge Trail sign. Turn right at the sign to reach the agate beds in one mile. There is a guide posted near the agate beds with helpful hints about the rock beds. As with wildflowers or anything else on trail, please refrain from taking these home in order to let future hikers discover these remarkable rocks as well."

This easy-access day hike delivers comparable—if not superior—panoramic views and lung-busting switchbacks to Mount Si, with significantly less foot traffic. Start by following the signs for John Wayne Trail and Twin Falls at the south end of the parking lot near the bathroom structure. This short spur trail climbs immediately south then west before merging with a gravel logging road in a few hundred yards. Stay right at the junction, continuing to climb uphill for another tenth of a mile, and stay right at the next junction with the John Wayne Pioneer Trail/Iron Horse Trail—another wide gravel logging road. In just a few hundred feet, head south on the second trail into the forest, 0.3 miles from the trailhead, marked by a small rock cairn. This is the start of the Mount Washington Trail.The trail climbs steeply to the southwest before easing to a moderate grade over rocky terrain and crossing several small creeks. While mostly switch-backing through an old growth forest of pines and sheer rock faces, the trail opens for occasional views to the North, revealing just how quickly it’s ascended from the parking lot.  Less than a mile from the trailhead, hikers pass the base of a small cave-turned-climbing wall, with several anchors speckling the inverted hang of its upper reaches. Continue climbing and veer right on the main path when the trail reaches its first official marker—a hand-carved wooden sign that reads “MT WA.” About 1.6 miles from the trailhead, a small clearing oft referred to as “Owl Hike Spot” offers the first westward views, allowing a brief photo-op of Rattlesnake Ledge. Previous trail guides often stopped at this point, but superior views are enjoyed farther along. Continue climbing and stay right at the junction with the Great Wall Trail at two miles, revealing the first views of the summit. The trail eases, exiting the dense cover of forest as it approaches a small marsh and turns sharply east toward another unmarked trail junction. Again, stay left, following the main path east as it navigates long switchbacks and bursts into an alpine meadow decorated with scree slopes, boulders and spring wildflowers at about the three mile mark.You'll soon arrive at a sharp switchback. At the curve of the switchback you're right on the boundary between public land and the Cedar River Watershed, the water supply for the city of Seattle. Signs along this section of trail ask you to respect the watershed, so be sure to stay on the trail here and practice Leave No Trace as you round a southwest-facing slope and make the final push to the summit of Mount Washington. From the top, take in views of the peaks surrounding you, but be sure to look down at Chester Morse Lake and Masonry Pool. It's amazing to realize that these two lakes are what help keep the megalopolis of Puget Sound hydrated."

Most hikers heading into the Enchantments use the Lake Stuart trailhead, but make for the Core zone via Colchuck Lake and Aasgard Pass. However, taking the right-hand trail 2.2 miles from the trailhead leads you into an adjacent valley, with a large, shallow lake at the base of the imposing massif of Mount Stuart. Depart the Stuart Lake Trailhead and follow rolling trail along Mountaineer Creek for 2.2 miles. Along the way, you’ll pass through marshy land dotted with trillium well into summer, since the snow sticks around at this altitude for quite a while. One and a half miles in, a large, sturdy log bridge crosses Mountaineer Creek; an eight-day WTA backcountry response team worked here in 2014 to install the new bridge when the old one was beginning to show signs of decay. Past the bridge, the trail begins to climb more steeply, through forest and large glacial erratics, boulders that are the last remnants of the ages when ice covered the landscape here. As you switchback through the forest, enjoy the sound of Mountaineer Creek crashing through the landscape, and see if you can spy Colchuck or Dragontail Peak through the trees. Just over two miles from the trailhead, the trail flattens out as you arrive at a junction. Hikers occasionally make a wrong turn here, so be sure to take a look at the trees to your right. Signs indicate Colchuck Lake is reached via the trail to the left, and Lake Stuart lies down the trail to the right, rolling out ahead of you on an almost flat grade. Lake Stuart lies 2 miles away, and includes some sections of moderate climbing, but for the most part, you’ll enjoy a relatively flat stroll back into the valley that holds Lake Stuart. While much of your hike is through second-growth forest, a large meadow about a half mile from Lake Stuart offers expansive views of the valley at the foot of Mount Stuart. It’s worth a short break for a photo, if nothing else. Continue on to Lake Stuart, which may surprise you with its proximity to the trail when you finally do reach it. Several camping spots lie along the lakeshore, but because you’re still in the Enchantments, you’ll need a permit for overnight camping between June 15 and October 15. If you’re camping, be mindful of signs indicating Fragile Areas in need of restoration – there’s no camping permitted here. And if you’re just here for the day, there are several day use areas with beachfront property for hot days. With its icy waters, the lake provides excellent relief from sweltering midsummer temperatures. WTA Pro Tip: In autumn, the larches here are gorgeous, lining the hillsides with golden light in the evenings. Don't forget your camera."

The climb ends above a blowdown area where hikers can almost see Mount Townsend. But the real draw to this trail are the curious saprophytic plants in the summer: Indian Pipe, candystick, coral root, and many other interesting types of flora bloom along this trail. In winter, this is an excellent snowshoe workout.  After the switchbacks, the trail comes out on FS 030. Head southwest on this road roughly 3 miles to a sharp right switchback onto FS 043 and ascend it to the summit of Buck Mountain.

Birds are abundant on the wetlands, and the forest is lush, with large, second-growth trees, a testament to the effort that several groups have put into managing this forest in order to restore the health of this area.Thanks to work from the Friends of Island Center Forest, the Vashon Forest Stewards, Vashon-Maury Island Land Trust, and Vashon-Maury Island Audubon, this nature preserve offers a network of forest trails to residents of (and visitors to) Vashon and Maury Island. There are several park entrances; the closest to the town of Vashon is from SW 188th St, the turn-off for which is just a half-mile south of the intersection in ""downtown"" Vashon. From this trailhead, complete with picnic benches and shelters, as well as maps of the preserve, it's an easy walk to Mukai Pond, a lovely wetland ringed with beautiful, colorful willows.The westside entrance is a wide spot in the road, but don't let the nearby restored Borrow Pit or the landfill next door stop you from heading into the park! After stopping to admire the great restoration work on the borrow pit, you'll soon be in lush forest--hushed, save for birds and squirrels. You will forget you're at a County park.A third access point is the Cemetary Trailhead, accessible from 115th Ave SW off SW Cemetary Road. This trailhead is more convenient for island locals, while visitors to Vashon will probably opt for the 118th St. entrance. There are 10 miles of trail at Island Center Forest, plenty of opportunity to wander to your heart's content. But be sure to take a map; there are some confusing intersections, though many are signed. And of course, as with any park adjacent to a neighborhood, there are many waytrails leading to homes. Having a map will help you avoid wandering into someone's backyard. Some trails can be quite muddy on a rainy day, and during the rainiest months, it is not possible to approach the walks at Mukai Pond or Meadowdale Pond, due to high water. If this is the case, go back another time!Watch for bicyclists and equestrians, and remember that this is a working forest, with recovery in process, so there may be trail closures. WTA Pro Tip: Consider making this a bike trip! It costs less to take a bike on the Fauntleroy Ferry, and the RapidRide C Line makes a stop at the terminal. From the Vashon terminal, huff and puff up the admittedly steep hill or hop on the bus. The bus stops just north of town, where you can bike to the turnoff at 188th St SW. If you're riding the whole way, know that the turnoff is 5.4 miles from the terminal. Trails in the park are bike friendly, or you can lock up your bike and hike. Afterwards, you can coast back through town, stopping for a bite to eat at Dragonfly Cafe and a browse at the bookstore. When you're ready to head home, hop on your bike and cruise back down to the ferry terminal."

To this day, one of Mr. Gault’s trucks rests approximately 2000 feet above Snoqualmie Pass, on the slopes of his eponymous mountain. But to obtain a commanding view of the west entrance to Snoqualmie Pass, you do not have to ascend quite as high as “Dirty Harry” drove his truck.The true trailhead lies along the gated road to the Washington State Fire Training Academy, but the gate closed to recreational users in 2011. Users must now park outside the gate, which now adds one-half mile to the trail, for a one-way distance of 3 miles to the overlook. Follow the access road over the bridge spanning the South Fork of the Snoqualmie River. After going 0.5 miles, watch for a few concrete blocks on the right and a brown trail marker sign a few yards up the trail from the blocks. Turn right onto the trail.The trail is one of Harry’s old logging roads, and the elevation gain is a moderate 1200 feet over 2.5 miles. The grade is tolerable and relatively consistent, though the tread is rocky. Enjoy a recovering forest of alder, Douglas fir, and western hemlock as you ascend, and try not to step on Pacific banana slugs, European black and brown slugs, and yellow spotted millipedes that cross this trail. There are two creek crossings, the second of which is more significant. It is 0.8 miles from the trailhead and requires one or two careful steps over a single-track log bridge. As you make your way, look for logging artifacts, especially rusty old cables.2.8 miles from your car, you will reach a subtle intersection where the main trail turns sharply left, a fainter spur trail goes to the right, and a large cairn is piled around a small tree. An old, rusty oil can formerly marked this spot, but regrettably it has been pilfered. If you do see any artifacts along this trail, please leave them for the next hikers to enjoy. Take the spur to the right. Follow it 0.2 miles through the forest. Near its terminus, it climbs over rock formations (no significant scrambling here) and deposits you onto a rocky balcony almost 1300 feet above I-90. Opposite you, from east to west, are Mount Kent, McClellan Butte with its famous rocky horn, and Mount Washington. Bandera Mountain is to the east. Take care near the edge, as this balcony does not have rails, and the drop-off is profound.WTA Pro Tip: Dirty Harry’s Balcony is an excellent winter hike, with the trail largely snow-free or easily passable in winter."

Those who survive will enjoy the same great views we’ve all come to love on the summit— the Snoqualmie Valley, the Issaquah-Hobart basin and, on clear days, Mount Rainier and the Seattle skyline. The trail starts off on the Tradition Plateau, which I’m pretty sure was a trail-builder’s prank, built in an effort to confuse hikers. So many great trails start here; walking in nearly any direction will lead you to immediately pull out your map and scratch your head. Adding to the befuddlement is the simple fact that nearly all the trails can make loops by using other trails. The Section Line follows that pattern and can be started or completed in a number of directions. My favorite way utilizes the Nook Trail as its starting point. Find the Nook Trail by following the Bus Trail to the southwest. Pass the West Tiger 3 Trail and look to the south (left) for a small sign indicating the Nook Trail’s start. Climb the Nook Trail through dense Northwest forest canopy, enjoying the sounds made by quiet brooks, the tremble of evergreen ferns and the flitting of dark-eyed “Oregon” juncos in the trees above. At 1.5 miles, arrive at Talus Rocks Loop Trail. Stay right (southwest) for another 0.3 mile and find the Section Line Trail, where you’ll lace up your boots and begin your ascent. Technically, the trail is “unmaintained”—hiker code for “this puppy is steep, steep, steep.” Stop often to rest as you make your way up a very rocky, somewhat loose and tree-rooted 0.5 mile. Cross the West Tiger Railroad Grade which gives you hope, inspiration and some flat ground, before popping back into the climb. Continue your high-stepping, hand-to-tree holding huff-’n-puff for another 0.4 mile before you are spit out onto the unmarked West Tiger Cable Line. Turn right (south) 0.1 mile and arrive at the West Tiger 3 vista with endorphins dancing.

From high cliffs overlooking the Tacoma Narrows people can watch bald eagles feed on salmon runs passing through on the strong tidal currents. Their calls can be heard from their nests in the old-growth forest that is preserved and makes up the northern section of the park.In winter, sea lions migrating from California frolic and feed in the swirling tides that rush beneath the Gig Harbor overlook—the northernmost point of the peninsula. Harbor seals are common near the tip of the point most of the year. Seal pups are frequently observed north of Owen Beach in late summer and early fall, though humans and their dogs should keep their distance to avoid spooking the pups.The park also provides habitat for mule deer, red foxes, pileated woodpeckers, Douglas squirrels, and raccoons."

At the time it was built, it was considered the best engineered of the transcontinental railroads. Your journey will take you on one of the intricate switchbacks that once started trains up the Cascades Mountains. Start out at the Martin Creek trailhead, and here you will now find a wonderful trail for hikers with physical challenges. The first part of this loop contains almost three miles of ADA accessible trail, and it is both interesting and beautiful. It is a wide gravel trail with wooden bridges across small creeks making the journey easy on wheelchairs. Admire the small waterfalls coming down. There are several old tunnels with trails going up to the opening, and collapsed timbers that once were protection from the snow. Note the dates stamped in the concrete at the entrance of the tunnels. Many of the tunnels and snow bridges were built after the Wellington Avalanche Disaster to better protect the trains from snow. Pause and read the interpretive signs in front, but the tunnels are unsafe to enter! There are more than tunnels and timber to tell the rail story. Interpretive signs along the way also tell of the people that built the railway. In a little over three miles, reach the paved turn off to the right and the start of the alternative trailhead by the red caboose. Stop here, let the little kids climb on the red caboose while the big kids read the display and check out the history. There are vault toilets here too.     To take the upper loop, follow the signs to the Windy Point crossover trail left at the junction. This is a steep switchbacking trail that gains elevation much faster than a train could. At the top, this trail intersects with the upper trail. You can go to the right and on to the Wellington trailhead for a longer hike, adding almost six miles to your total. For a nice lunch stop and good views of Stevens Pass, surrounding peaks and the present railroad line, take the right trail for just a quarter of a mile to the Windy Point viewpoint. There are some nice lunch rocks and if you are lucky, you might hear, or see pikas. To make the loop and return to Martin Creek, take the left upper trail, a rougher trail than the lower one. This trail will take you by the remnants of several snow sheds. There are usually waterfalls coming off the top of some of them. Notice the signs beside the trail with numbers, these are the miles to (or from) Chicago, where the railroad originated. It is worth taking the Spillway Spur stairs just to see where the old reservoir once was. The new Cascade Tunnel was opened in 1929 and the old grade abandoned. Perhaps you can hear the whistle of a train climbing over the mountains even now. Follow the Martin Creek crossover back to your car.WTA Pro-Tip: Read ‘The White Cascade’ by Gary Krist, an account of the Wellington Avalanche Disaster, then hike the rest of the trail to the Wellington trailhead with a deeper appreciation of history and our Cascade mountain weather."

North Idaho's Pulaski Trail delves into the history of the man, the tool he designed, and the 1910 wildfires that still leave their mark on North Idaho.This is an interpretive trail, so plan to spend as much time reading the trailside signs as hiking on this four mile round-trip hike along a creek.  At trails-end is the tunnel and commemorative markers indicating where Ed Pulaski saved all but six of the 45 firefighters under his command by holding them at gunpoint in a mine tunnel.  His armed insistence on their remaining inside the tunnel saved them from smoke inhalation and the high temperatures outside their shelter.  Due the significance of the events that happened here in August 1910, both the trail and the tunnel are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

From the roadside trailhead you immediately plunge into rainforest, more in tune with what you would expect to see in the Olympics. The first half mile is a casual stroll amid mossy and dripping cedar, western hemlock, big leaf and vine maple, and a forest floor occasionally carpeted with western Washington's harbingers of spring; skunk cabbage and trillium. At the first junction veer right, where the trail begins climbing in earnest up the lower flank of Little Ranger Peak. Along the way, be sure to follow the signs for Snoquera Falls Loop 1167. A little more than a mile in, the trail drops into a small basin where the streaming cascade of Snoquera Falls plunges down a rocky face. The volume in the falls changes dramatically with the seasons. In springtime, when heavy winter snows are melting rapidly, the falls can be roaring, filling the basin with cold spray. In the later summer months, the falls may reduce to but a trickle, eventually picking up again with autumn rains. If the water is too high when you visit and you can't safely cross the creek on the rock face, go back the way you came and plan a return trip later in the summer.  Cross the creek at the base of the falls and begin switchbacking downhill, back towards the parking lot.

The trail is moderately steep but short, following Sawtooth Ridge 1.6 miles to the summit, where a fire lookout cabin clings to the top.Bring water, as there is none along the trail, and no amenities whatsoever at the trailhead. After parking, a look around Towhead Gap will reveal two battered trailhead signs, on opposite sides of the road. You want the one on the northwest side, where the road first widens to form the parking area. The sign may still be legible: “High Rock Lookout Trail 266.” Immediately to the right is what looks like an wider trail heading up. Ignore it; it narrows into an eroding boot path that connects with the main trail in a tenth of a mile.The main trail starts out somewhat narrow, and lined with vegetation. After connecting with the boot path, it follows the ridgeline up, entering a forest of young fir and hemlock that provides shade for most of the climb. The trail is adequately wide the rest of the way. Huckleberries are plentiful along the lower part. Bear grass, trilliums, and penstemon are less common.The ascent is moderately steep and has few switchbacks, climbing steadily to the north-northwest just below or along the crest of Sawtooth Ridge. The tread is good, with few roots or rocks to contend with. At 0.7 and 0.9 miles are wooden benches, offering a convenient place to rest. From here on, the trail steepens, as trailside vegetation thins in favor of larger trees.At 1.3 miles, the trail tops the ridgeline at a rock outcropping and viewpoint. A steep drop-off prevents getting an easy view of the summit, but it is close. Continue up the west side of the ridge top, passing below the visible lookout cabin, to the northern edge of Sawtooth Ridge, where the sheerness of the northern face becomes apparent. Turn right for the final 200 yards, onto the large and flat sloped rock that the lookout building is fastened to. The cabin was built in 1929, but is no longer staffed. Building occupancy is prohibited due to the lack of lightning protection.The United States Geological Survey classifies High Rock as a “pillar”, a “vertical, standing, often spire-shaped, natural rock formation”. The exposure on this pillar is worthy of caution; there are no longer any cables to protect you from a sheer vertical drop, as much as 600 feet on the north side. Enjoy the views from the rock or from the wraparound deck of the lookout cabin. Mount Rainier is to the northeast, as is Cora Lake, over 1800 feet below you.

In about 500 yards look for the trailhead, near the campground loop. The first half of this trail is indicated as 'moderate', probably due to the muddiness and rolling nature of the path. But it winds through lush forest and around a small inlet to a charming covered bridge, providing a dry shelter if it's a rainy day.

Also look and listen for birds, ducks and geese love the quiet waters here. The trail ends near the fishing dock and picnic area, close to the trailhead for the second hike that begins in the park. This is the Sylvia Creek Forestry Trail, which meanders for a mile along Sylvia Creek in the same forest you peeked into at the gravel road on the last trail. Cross the creek over a manmade dam that created the lake, and make your return trip on the opposite side of the creek.

The basalt butte has a rich history; first used by native people many years ago, and during the ice age, the Great Missoula Floods carved the canyons here, while the rock stood as an island in the raging river. Now, with the Columbia rolling out in its original course, Steamboat Rock lies high and dry, offering excellent 360-degree panoramas of the landscape surrounding it. The butte covers 600 acres and the trail that ascends from the base of the rock to the somewhat flat top affords hikers incredible views of the surrounding area after an initially steep and scree-y ascent. If you can get there for wildflowers, do so. There’s something surreal about strolling through a lush meadow of bobbing flowers 800 feet in the air. Even if you miss flower season, the views here are stunning at any time of year. The rolling hills of the Colville National Forest back up the flat scablands to the north, the snow-capped peaks of the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest stand sentinel near Chelan to the west, and south, the waters of Banks Lake are picturesque in almost any weather. But first, you have to get up there. There are several trails that feed into the main trail that approaches the base of Steamboat Rock. From the day use area or the campground, look for a sandy path just across the paved road that you drove on to get here. Jump on that sandy path and immediately begin walking towards the mighty rock through sagebrush and arrowleaf balsamroot. The sandy path can be a little tiring to walk in, but you’ll only be on it for a short while. In less than a half-mile, arrive at the base of the rock. The trail is now comprised primarily of loose rock—or scree—while you climb up a draw between the cliffs. Watch your footing here and be mindful of other hikers near you. After the short vertical ascent, arrive at a fork in the trail. Either way, you have just a little more elevation gain ahead of you, but the trail loops all the way around the plateau, so select either way—you’ll arrive back at this junction at the end of your hike. If you elect to head north, you’ll see Banks Lake and Grand Coulee below sheer cliffs. Those who have trouble with hikes may want to note that the trail goes quite close to these cliffs before turning south and meandering through more rolling meadows. If you take the left trail, get you’ll see more of Banks Lake and cliff walls to the east—the only direction that you don’t have miles of views. The trail to the south does get a little tricky to find, so be sure to have a map with you. Thanks to a trail that cuts through the center of the rock, it is possible to do either the Northern Loop or the Southern Loop, depending on the time you have available. The northern section can be done as a three mile loop, and the second section is about 2.5 miles. WTA Pro Tip: If you’re heading south after your hike, be sure to stop at Dry Falls State Park. The overlook is an impressive view of what used to be a giant waterfall during the Ice Age floods, and there’s an ice cream truck to refresh yourself!"

A little over a mile you find your way into the Alpine Lakes Wilderness. Wipe the sweat from your brow and look around as you pass by countless burnt and blackened ponderosa pines towering above you. But look to the feet of these burnt sentinels too; wildflowers are plenteous here, try to find Indian Paintbrush, mountain monkshood, fireweed and more. After 2.8 miles of beauty you reach the almost marsh-like Little Eightmile Lake. Rest assured this is not your destination, though it makes a nice resting spot for those that want to catch their breath before the final push to the real destination. As you start down the trail past Little Eighmile Lake, you come to another signed junction. Stay straight, following the main trail. The spur trail will lead you to Lake Caroline and Windy Pass. The last half mile from Little Eightmile Lake will take you through a small boulder field where life may surprise you in the form of a mountain squirrel, pika or marmot. As you near the lake the trail gets steeper as you pass so close to Eightmile Creek you can reach out and touch it. It’s splashing and chatter make it tempting to stop here, but you are almost to an even more inviting lunch spot. Once you reach the lake, search the treed and rocky shores for access, and enjoy the view of this breathtaking mountain lake. Pull out your map and locate Eightmile Mountain, dip your feet or jump right in, you deserve it! For more exploring follow the trail to the right as it wanders along the shore for almost a mile.Note that while backpacking is allowed at the lake, it is by permit only from June 15th through October 15th. Permits can be hard to get during this time; camping in the Enchantments Area is on a lottery permit system, so be sure to get your registration in before the deadline if you want to spend the night here.WTA Pro Tip: Make a stop at Leavenworth’s Heidleburger Drive-In for a flavorful burger and shake."

Entry is free, and official hours are daily 4 a.m. to 11 p.m. The Discovery Park Loop Trail is a designated National Recreation Trail, 2.8 miles long with an elevation change of just 140 feet. It passes through both forest and open meadows, offers extensive views, good prospects for bird watchers, and can be hiked or jogged year-round.Before there was a park here, this area was Fort Lawton and it is thanks to the fort that this large park is available to Seattlites who wish to explore an urban trail. More information on the history of the park follows the trail description.Begin your Loop Trail hike near the Visitor Center, reached from W Government Way. The center is open Tuesday through Sunday most weeks, 8:30 a.m. - 5 p.m. (closed holidays.) It offers some environmental displays, indoor restrooms, an information desk and trail maps. Find your trailhead next to a signboard at the north end of the parking lot. The board has a park map, and often has paper copies of the trail map available for the taking. Trail maps can also be downloaded: see the Maps and Guidebooks section of this entry for the link. Two additional trailheads are mentioned below. Since this is a loop hike, they could be considered as alternative starting points. For more details, see the Driving Directions. From the signboard, head north on the trail, first going down a few steps, then hiking gently uphill for 100 yards to reach the Loop Trail. You can hike the Loop in either direction, although many think views are better if you begin by going left here. Climb a very short steep section, then level out and drop a bit. Cross a paved road--one of many dating from the military era, now used only by park vehicles. Climb some more. Here, and in all forested areas of the park, be alert for the tapping sounds of woodpeckers, including the large pileated woodpeckers sometimes seen in the park.For the next quarter mile the trail heads generally south, eventually leveling out and bending around to the west. Along the way, in late winter, you might see the white blossoms of Indian plum, a scraggly shrub that is the first to blossom each year. In the spring, you might see the bright yellow blossoms of Oregon grape or the red blooms of wild currant. Later bloomers are the native salmonberry and thimble berry.Here, and in other forested areas along the Loop Tail, tall trees sometimes fall during wind storms. You may notice a few large trunks of trees that have met that end. In 2005, a large maple tree in the park was struck by lightning and literally exploded. So dynamic events do happen here, although hopefully not during your hike.Pass by the South Parking Lot, an alternative access point for the Loop Trail, reached from W Emerson Street. Then continue on west next to the access road and soon reach the highest point on the Loop Trail. A sign points right toward a viewpoint near the old chapel that looks out over the South Meadow. You can check it out if you like. Then return to the Loop Trail, drop a bit, cross a park road and approach the meadow.In winter, you may be lucky to see a rare arctic snowy owl near this end of the meadow. In summer or fall, scan the trees to the north of the meadow for red-tail or Cooper's hawks.While great blue herons generally hunt for fish in the shallows near the shore, when fishing is not good a heron may fly up to the meadow to hunt mice. If you see a heron standing completely still in the tall grass, it's waiting for lunch.Bald eagles also prefer fish, so they usually cruise along the shore or perch high in a tree overlooking the water. But their flight paths sometimes are visible from the Loop Trail so as you cross the meadow, be alert for eagle sightings.The trail continues near the southern edge of the meadow where a short side trail leads left to a restroom facility. The views along the trail improve with every step, with the Olympic Mountains visible in the distance across Puget Sound. To the north of the meadow, a large radar dome is visible. It's an FAA radar that tracks commercial flights.You'll approach a sandy area. It's not a desert, but sand does accumulate there, blown up over the bluff by prevailing winds. Loop around the north edge of the sand dune and, in summer, note the large stand of fireweed blooming just off the trail.Before you reach the next trees, a bench offers a great view toward the south end of Puget Sound, with parts of Magnolia and West Seattle visible. If clouds permit, you may see Mount Rainier in the distance.Hike a short way beneath the trees and come to a headland that offers some of the best views in the park. Take a few minutes to appreciate it all. But take note: the bluff here is unstable and slides do occur, so it's best not to approach the edge too closely.As you leave the viewpoint, a side trail heads off to the left and leads a half-mile down to South Beach and the West Point Lighthouse. Continue on the Loop Trail, now heading north. Soon the trail forks. The left fork is the official Loop Trail. The right fork follows a metal fence and soon reconnects with the Loop Trail. Unless you have a fondness for hiking next to fences, take the left fork.Come to Discovery Park Boulevard, a road that provides access to the West Point Sewage Treatment Plant. Appropriately, a portable toilet generally sits beside the Loop Trail just before you come to the road crossing. Cross the road, continue following the trail next to the road, then head down through a forested area to reach the much smaller North Meadow. Here, the Hidden Valley Trail heads off to the left and provides another route to the beach. Climb a bit on the Loop Trail, and cross two paved old roads. The second one is shown on the trail map as Kansas Avenue.Beyond Kansas Avenue, the Loop Trail winds through two heavily forested canyons. In some years, barred owls are seen here and along the next half-mile of the trail. The owls generally are not active during the day, and if seen at all they will be dozing part way up a tree. An exception is during nesting season, when the owls can become aggressive. Sometimes hikers or joggers are buzzed by an owl, or may even be rapped on the scalp by a talon. The owls seem particularly troubled by any person sporting a ponytail or headphones.Continue on the Loop Trail. Along the way, a side trail heads downhill to the left to reach the North Parking Lot, another access point for this hike. Farther along, come to Illinois Avenue, where a second trail also heads downhill to the North Parking Lot. Cross Illinois Avenue with caution. It's a public road between the Visitor Center and the North Parking Lot. The crossing is well-marked, but not all drivers are alert for hikers.Along the next part of the Loop Trail, you might catch a view of Mount Baker off to the north.A quarter mile farther along, a veteran's cemetery is visible though the trees. Soon, the Loop Trail passes though a tunnel under W Government Way and you will and find yourself back at the trail junction where you began the Loop Trail. The parking lot and Visitor Center are just a short stroll away.With luck, you will have had some interesting bird sightings on your hike. The Seattle Audubon Society lists 270 species sometimes seen in the park, or just offshore.While birds are abundant here, you may not have seen any wild critters larger than a squirrel. There are raccoons in the park, but they are mostly nocturnal, like the smaller resident mountain beavers, so they are not often seen. But occasionally larger fauna have found their way to Discovery Park, perhaps by following the railroad tracks. In early 2008, a coyote was a park resident for several weeks. In May 2009, a black bear was spotted at least passing through the park, if not actually residing there. In September 2009, reports of a mountain lion sighting in the park were greeted with skepticism. But they persisted, and soon a lion was tracked, treed, tranquilized and transported, we hope to a happier habitat. So you never know. When you hike the Loop Trail bring your camera and be alert for surprises. Enjoy whatever you do see.A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE AREAIn 1898, the War Department wanted an army base in the Puget Sound area to protect against any future naval invasion. It had been less than 40 years since US and British forces almost clashed over a disputed border in the San Juan Islands. Fortunately, that 1859 conflict was quickly defused. Only a single shot was fired and that was by a civilian. The only casualty was a pig.While the military had their own motivations, local communities saw a large military base as an opportunity for economic gain. Also, it was hoped in some quarters that the army might be enlisted to help in the event of civil unrest. Labor disputes, in particular, were common in that era. Though there was considerable rivalry between Seattle and Tacoma to see which city would host the army base, Seattle won. The city had to offer the land to the military for free, after buying out a few landowners who already owned plots there.The fort opened in 1900, and was named in honor of Major General Henry Lawton, a recent casualty of the Philippine-American conflict who had fought in earlier wars and in 1886 had played a prominent role in the capture of Apache Chief Geronimo. Fort Lawton never became the major army post local boosters hoped for. The garrison remained small, and it languished even more as time went on. At the height of the great depression, in 1938, the Army offered to sell Fort Lawton back to Seattle for only one dollar. The city declined, citing concerns about potential maintenance costs.During the Second World War, Fort Lawton was revived as an embarkation point for thousands of soldiers and tons of material headed to the South Pacific or to the Aleutians. Also, the Fort hosted a prisoner-of-war camp that held over 1000 German prisoners. During the Korean War of 1950-53, the Fort enjoyed another bustle of activity.In the 1950s, Nike anti-aircraft missile batteries were installed at Fort Lawton, and elsewhere in the Puget Sound area. A hardened missile control center that coordinated all the local batteries was located at the Fort. But within a few years those weapons were obsolete. Later, Fort Lawton was proposed as a launch site for inter-continental ballistic missiles (ICBMs,) but that plan never materialized. In 1973, much of Fort Lawton was returned to the city of Seattle to become Discovery Park, although the Army Reserve did maintain a presence there until 2012. It was the long army tenure that eventually made the park possible, since the area otherwise would likely have become suburban housing."

The park includes all of Piper's Creek (sometimes written without the apostrophe) plus the adjoining side hills and some side streams, plus a beach area. Park trails can be accessed from several points, and there is an access road that leads to a parking area near the beach. Park entrance is free, and official hours are daily, 6 a.m. to 10 p.m.The hike described here includes the entire length of Piper's Creek, plus a number of trails on the north and south ridges above the creek. For a shorter or easier hike, a glance at the trails map will suggest other possibilities.Some brief history may be of interest: The Piper family tended gardens and planted fruit trees in a logged-over area near the creek beginning in the 1880s. Their produce was hauled by wagon to city markets, then some distance away. Andrew Piper was a baker, candy maker and artist, and he was elected to the Seattle City Council as a Socialist. His wife Minna was the principal gardener and orchardist. Daughter Tillie, a Seattle school teacher, lived in a cabin at the site and was an early visitor to the Paradise area of Mount Rainier, then (1890) reachable only by horse. Land for the park was acquired by the city in 1927, using funds donated by the Carkeek family. The Pipers' former orchard was long-forgotten and lay hidden by brambles for many years. It was rediscovered in 1981, and today the non-profit Friends of Pipers Orchard works to restore it. You might check the Historical Posts link at their website (www.pipersorchard.org) for more comments about life here in the early days of Seattle.Begin your hike today at the Eddie McAbee Entrance on NW 100th Place, near 6th Ave NW. There's a signboard at the trailhead with a park map and often, paper copies of a trail map available for the taking. (Trail maps also can be downloaded from www.seattle.gov/parks/trails.asp.) Additional trailheads are mentioned below and, since this is a loop hike, other starting points could be considered. For additional details, see the Driving Directions. The Piper's Creek Trail begins with a quick descent on four short switchbacks to reach the headwaters of Piper's Creek. The creek at first is not much more than a trickle. But, as you follow the trail downstream the creek becomes more substantial in response to inputs from seeps and from additional trickles and rivulets, some arriving via side canyons, others via culverts from the surrounding highlands.In a quarter-mile your trail is joined on the right by the Viewlands Trail, another option for reaching Piper's Creek. You can find trailheads for the Viewlands Trail north and south of the Viewlands Elementary School. The two branches come together behind the school, in a blackberry patch, before descending to Piper's Creek.As you continue down the Piper's Creek Trail, the steep-sided canyon sports many tall trees, both deciduous and coniferous, and during major storms blowdowns are common. The winter of 2014-15 seems to have been a difficult one for the tall trees, and many new blowdowns are evident.You will pass Piper's Orchard, now considerably restored. Just beyond the orchard, your trail crosses a small creek that once provided irrigation water for the orchard and gardens. In February, snowdrops (galanthus) bloom on the slope between the creek and the orchard. They are not native, but are long-established in the area. They are one of the earliest flowers to bloom in the park, along with the native Indian plum.As you proceed down Piper's Creek Trail, a brown building begins to loom up downstream. The unlovely edifice is a Metro sewage pumping station that gathers and sends piped effluent on toward the main treatment facility at West Point. The pumping station seems to have no discernible impact on Piper's Creek.Before reaching the station, note a trail junction on the right. The trails map identifies it as the aptly-named Fern Glen Trail. Turn here and hike the short trail up the side canyon, gaining 100 feet, and coming to the park access road. Cross the road and enter the parking area for the Environmental Learning Center. As of 2015, the Center remains closed due to city funding problems. The parking area offers another access point for park trails.Cross the meadow, past picnic tables, to the west side and note the Education Center Trail coming down the hill from the right. That short trail gains a mere 40 feet to reach NW 116th street, and another possible trailhead for park access. It's worth taking the five minute side trip up that trail, and back, for the views down on the canyons of Mohlendorph Creek and Venema Creek.After the side trip, find the ongoing trail at the southwest corner of the meadow and descend it back to the road. Follow the road west just a few feet, crossing over Mohlendorph Creek, and find the 12th Avenue Hillclimb Trail just past a Speed Bump sign. Either take this trail or, for a less ambitious hike, cross the road and rejoin the Piper's Creek Trail continuing west along the creek.In late October and early November you might prefer the creekside option anyway, because in many years Piper's Creek has a significant fall salmon run. Current efforts to restore the run begin at area schools, where fertilized eggs obtained from hatcheries actually hatch. Tiny salmon fry are relocated to a holding tank at the confluence of Mohlendorph and Venema Creeks, and the fry are imprinted with the ""flavor"" of water from Venema Creek. They are released and go to sea for a few years, and then survivors return to Piper's Creek to spawn. A few even seek to fight their way up tiny Mohlendorph Creek to the site of the holding tank. Unless you are returning to the Piper's Creek Trail, take the 12th Avenue Hillclimb a short way uphill and come to a signed junction. The right fork continues up to 12th Ave NW, another access point for park trails. The left fork, your ongoing route, is the North Traverse. Here, and elsewhere in the park, be alert for the loud tapping of pileated woodpeckers that sometimes are seen along park trails.The North Traverse is joined by a short trail coming up from a parking area, and soon it meets the Grand Fir Trail, an unmistakable trail heading uphill to the right. You might wonder about a much fainter path a few feet before you reach the Grand Fir Trail. It formerly provided access to a trailhead on NW 116th St. But the landowner at the upper end has posted that former trailhead No Trespassing. Until the legal situation is clarified it will be better to avoid that faint trail. Instead, continue a few steps farther on the North Traverse and take a sharp right turn onto the Grand Fir Trail. Follow the Grand Fir Trail uphill and soon reach another trail junction at Signpost Number 2. The trail arriving from the right comes from an official park trailhead on NW 117th St. Continue on the trail that heads left, cross a small stream, and come to a junction with the North Meadow Hillclimb. Turn right, and head uphill, passing a large granite boulder (a glacial erratic) along the way, and join the North Bluff Trail. Turn right and, in a couple of minutes, reach the small North Meadow. You have come up about 200 feet from Piper's Creek.The meadow is bordered by back yards and offers no street access, so please stay on park land. During the winter, when leaves are down, there are views out to Puget Sound and the Olympics, but these are obscured when trees leaf out in the spring. Note a tall fir just down slope from the meadow. Sometimes a bald eagle, or even a pair of eagles, is seen perched at the top.Descend the North Bluff Trail all the way down to the picnic area, dropping about 240 feet. Along the way there are brief views out to the Sound and down to the railroad tracks. When you reach the picnic area it may be well attended. Often, school events are held there. There are unobstructed views across the Sound to the Olympics, and a display board helps to identify Olympic peaks.A bridge crosses over the railroad tracks to provide beach access. Feel free to explore the beach, but please stay off the tracks. Trains can appear suddenly, sometimes from both directions at once, and there have been fatalities here.Just beyond a signboard next to the bridge, take the stairs down toward the fence and continue on, passing a junction with the Wetlands Trail (a western extension of the Piper's Creek Trail.) Cross over the lower end of Piper's Creek as it enters a tunnel under the tracks. Come to a grassy field, and follow the fence to reach the South Bluff Trail.Climb steeply up the trail, gaining 180 feet, to reach the tiny South Meadow with a bench and (leaves permitting) more views out to the sound. Then head east on the South Ridge Trail. In just a few feet, at Signpost Number 3, a trail leaves the park headed south. It leads to Mary Ave NW, another possible park access point. Stay on the South Ridge Trail. In less than a half-mile, come to Signpost Number 7, where a trail arrives from NW Norcross Way, yet another park access point. Continue on the South Ridge Trail, cross two small streams on rustic bridges, and descend, dropping 140 feet, back down to Piper's Creek at Signpost Number 8. Turn right here, cross Piper's Creek on a new metal-decked bridge (a replacement for a wooden bridged severely damaged by blowdowns) and return to your trailhead via the Piper's Creek Trail, gaining 220 feet on the way."

From beginning to end, the route offers a wide array of scenery, from the jagged peaks of the Cascades to valleys, ridges, meadows and woods in the expansive and rugged Pasaysten Wilderness. Early fall is the best time to come, when the fall foliage puts on a brilliant display of reds, golds, yellows and green throughout this 70-mile stretch.  Though it starts in Rainy Pass, this section is actually protected from much of the rain and snow that Mount Baker and the rest of the North Cascades to the west are so well known for. For this reason, late-season hikers should be prepared to pack in water, though water sources are available at Harts Pass. From late October through mid-summer, however, hikers should still expect and prepare for snowy and icy conditions, and winter hikers must watch out for avalanche conditions along the often exposed route. Through hikers should also keep in mind that there are no supplies available along this section, and the only vehicle access is at Harts Pass, where Road 5400 crosses the trail. Also remember to bring your passport and review the border crossing procedures, as this section crosses the US-Canada border at Monument 78 66.2 miles into the trek.(NOTE: As of 10/2010, it is no longer legal to cross the border heading southbound into the US from Canada on the PCT.

Instead, a scenic trail ambles peacefully through rolling alpine meadows blanketing the broad shoulder of Sahale Mountain. This park-like setting is made all the more spectacular by contrast with the dramatic mountainous terrain that stretches off in every direction near and far. Begin by following the Cascade Pass trail. From Cascade Pass, the trail heads north (left when arriving at the pass) and switchbacks its way up a steep slope. In early summer, it is a sea of glacier lilies; in fall, it is covered in mountain blueberries. In amongst the shrubs and wildflowers here, a population of marmots-unofficial ambassadors of Sahale Arm–begin a welcome that continues for much of the hike. Lumbering through the meadows, they seem not only unconcerned by the hikers passing through, but intent on entertaining them. Approximately three quarters of a mile from Cascade Pass, the trail crests a rounded shoulder at 6,000 feet in elevation and emerges suddenly to an awesome sight: Sahale Mountain and its eponymous glacier. Shimmering silver ribbons of meltwater snake their way down the precipitous slopes of the mountain some 3,000 feet to Doubtful Lake, tucked just out of sight. The trail heads left, offering peeks at Doubtful Lake below. The next fifth of a mile is mostly flat, a gentle stroll through heather before turning right towards Sahale Mountain. Though seeming to make its way gradually through small groves of trees, the trail climbs quite steeply around the bend before once again attaining the ridge. To the left, views open up to the unforgiving terrain of Boston Basin. Peaks with names like “Forbidden” and “Torment” tower above the Quien Sabe (“Who Knows”) Glacier. Further off in the distance, Mount Baker, Shuksan and Eldorado dot the skyline. After another half mile, the trail once again levels out as it passes the occasional tarn and outcroppings of granite set amongst windblown grass. You could be forgiven for feeling as if you’ve been transplanted to the Scottish Highlands. Enjoy this section while it lasts. In another fifth of a mile, the trail pitches upward again through a rutted, muddy section along a quietly cascading stream. The trail doesn’t let up again until it reaches the Sahale Glacier Camp, a collection of flat spots ringed with rocks piled up against the wind. The final half mile climbs sharply over scree and rock.Some of the campsites sit on the very edge of the terminal moraine of the glacier. The views are simply amazing. From here, you can see beyond the peaks of Cascade Pass to an endless procession of mountains such as Formidable and Spider. To the east, Sahale connects to Buckner Mountain, and beyond sit Storm King and Goode, the tallest summit in North Cascades National Park. In fall, Sahale Arm itself is the best part of the vista, as the meadows turn a brilliant shade of rust-red. As if there weren’t enough to draw you here already, Sahale Arm is also a reliable place to spot bear. An impressively large black bear with a glossy coat has been repeatedly spotted meandering across Sahale Arm and occasionally down to Cascade Pass.

Cross the road and follow the signs, now labeled 'Steam Donkey Trail'. This is the trail on which the small steam donkey - a steam-powered winch used in logging operations - ran when this area was actively logged. Begin heading downhill now, passing several structures that WTA work crews have installed in an effort to keep the abundant water in this area off the trail. Turnpikes, culverts, and even the bridge across the large creek at the bottom of the hill are all WTA projects from years past. Before the bridge, pass a large pond to your left. The water here powered the steam donkey when the area was still a logging show. Soon you'll come to another crossing with the road.

The road is bordered by private property, so stay on the road. After a mile, enter the Mica Peak Conservation Area. The peak itself is off-limits, since it on land owned by Inland Empire Paper, and the summit is owned by the FAA, but the western slope of the peak still offers 2,000 feet of elevation gain from parking area to high point. Consult your map to plan your route. Mica Peak was acquired in 2013 through Spokane County's Conservation Futures Program. The area hosts several varieties of flora, thanks to its elevation change from the parking area to the summit. When here, look for sub-alpine low brush to fragrant Ponderosa pine forest. Aspen and birch groves also thrive here, making the hill glow gold in the autumn. Visitors can also enjoy views of Spokane Valley and the rolling Palouse."

After about a gentle mile of this trail you’ll come to the intersection with the Royal Basin trail just a few steps before the footlog bridge spanning Royal Creek. Turn right to join the Royal Basin Trail.The trail soon makes a couple switchbacks and though it rises above the creek, the clatter and din of the plunging waters provide mood music for your trek.  You’ll stay left at the intersection with the Mount Maynard way trail and soon enter Olympic National Park. The trail passes through moss-carpeted halls of firs and hemlocks with a few step-over creeks to negotiate.  Soon the trail breaks into talus-strewn open stretches with commanding views up, down and across the valley. The first of these often features a white-ribboned waterfall streaming down a cliff face about a half mile upslope from the trail. After revisiting the creek near some campsites the trail diverges from the waters and climbs via switchbacks again on open slopes.  The trail takes on a pattern of long traverses punctuated by steep climbs.  Switchbacks help you on the ascents before Royal Lake. The two climbs above the lake to get to the Upper Basin are more direct.At 7.2 miles and 5,100 feet of elevation, Royal Lake is a gem. The land around has suffered in the past from overuse that prompted the Park’s camping reservation system. Up valley from the lake is a seasonal Ranger post. Follow the side trail past the Ranger tent platform to a fine view of waterfalls.   Shelter Rock with its massive sheltering overhang is hard to miss on your left as you continue upward. With the rock looming almost directly above you, you’ll cross a short footlog and start striding upward to where the trail levels off at Arrowhead Meadow. Enjoy the views and the gentle grade. You’ll soon be crossing an unbridged stream and ascending to Upper Royal Basin. The blue tarns are to the west and a little bit higher at about 5700 feet.Some off-trail hikers can head even farther from the upper basin, either south over a ridge into Deception Basin or east over a ridge into Milk Creek Basin.WTA Pro Tip: Most of this trip is in Olympic National Park. If you plan on overnight camping, the area around Royal Lake and Basin has limited camping permits. Contact the Wilderness Information Center at Olympic National Park for permit and reservation."

After the second big waterfall, at one and a half miles, the trail climbs away from the river.  Although there are no mountain views, the forest here is still beautiful. Stately sword fern, soft maidenhair fern, deer fern, moss and twinflower line the path. Still mostly good trail, there are some rocky, rooty and muddy spots along this section. The trail will drop down and cross a few creeks before climbing one more time. The trail eventually levels out, then drops down, crosses a muddy swamp, and ends at a nice camp spot along the river, a good place for lunch and maybe a little wading. This used to be called Boulder Ford, as the trail once continued on to Tupso Pass and Three Fingers Lookout. Sadly, there is nothing left of it now."

Though doable as a day hike, it is better enjoyed as an overnight destination, with nearby Alta Mountain and Lila Lake making excellent side trips.Start by following the trail to Rachel Lake, a 3.5 mile trail that gets increasingly steep and rugged as you get closer to the lake.  There are some waterfalls along the way to distract you from the trail, but the ratio of scenery to effort is low on this early section of the trail. It's a haul up to Rachel Lake, but once there, you'll be happy you took the time to do it.As you arrive at the lake, look for a trail on your right marked “Trail”, near the trail to the privy (marked “Toilet”). This trail heads north initially, and then turns west as it travels around the north side of the lake. Once you have located the trail, take a break for a few minutes to enjoy Rachel Lake. The lake is a worthy destination in its own right, with plenty of space to spread out and camp, swim, or just relax.  When you’re ready to continue climbing, head back to the trail signed “Trail”.  This rocky trail switchbacks steeply up to the ridge in just half a mile.  Along the way, you will enjoy periodic views of Rachel Lake.When you get to the ridge, you’ll see a trail off to your right, and then a few feet later a sign marking that trail. The trail to the right heads to Lila Lake and Alta Mountain. Lila Lake is more open and features distant views. A climber’s path to Alta Mountain branches off of the Lila Lake trail, and is even more rough and steep than what you have already experienced. But your destination is Rampart Lakes, so save the trail to Lila Lake and Alta Mountain for another time and turn left on the trail to Rampart Lakes.As you near Rampart Lakes, you’ll notice a maze of social trails. It can sometimes be difficult to tell which one to take. Look carefully at trail junctions; sometimes you will see a pile of rocks or sticks blocking a trail. This indicates a trail to avoid using.Following the main trail, you’ll encounter lots of berries, several lakes, a signed backcountry privy, and eventually the two largest lakes. You’ll probably also find plenty of people swimming, camping, and enjoying picnic lunches.  This environment is fragile and overused. To help keep it intact, be careful to stay on the trail or durable surfaces such as rock. If you’re staying overnight, take note that there is a back-country privy near the large lake, with signs pointing to it.WTA Pro Tip: If you’re backpacking, consider side trips to Lila Lake and Alta Mountain."

Lake Whatcom has the unusual privilege of functioning both as the city's watershed and as an active recreation area for residents. As such, recreation in this area is well-controlled, and this trail is one of only two points on the lake that provides public access to the waterfront. But step just a few feet down the trail and you'll leave the crowds behind, with only old-growth trees and silent cliffs to keep you company. Accessible year-round, this trail is perfect for hikers from all backgrounds, since it only has 100 feet of elevation gain, and plenty of distractions along the way in the form of streams, waterfalls, and lake views. In autumn, the trees blaze with color, reflecting in the lake's surface. An interpretive kiosk provides information about the area about half a mile in, and the one-mile point is marked by a large waterfall, which is always worth a photo. Press on, and at 2.5 miles, you'll see enormous old-growth trees lining the path, which is an old railroad grade. The wideness of the path and the gentleness of the grade make it a great multi-use trail, so be prepared to share it with runners and mountain bikers, as well as fellow hikers.

Then work your way around the lake on a 2.6 mile smooth gravel loop path close to the lakeside. Keep an eye out for mallard ducks, American coots, cormorants, buffleheads, and other waterfowl on the lake. Around the north side of the lake, take a turn up into the hills above the lake to avoid the crowds. This 0.8 mile detour is about the same length as the section of gravel loop around the lake that it parallels, but it’s a slightly less well-maintained trail with fewer people, and it goes deeper into the forest. Along this trail watch for deep conifer forest as you ascend, emerge into moss-covered deciduous trees along the way, and don’t forget to admire the layer of sword ferns along the forest floor.

The Fragrance Lake trailhead is on Chuckanut Drive, directly across from the main entrance to Larrabee State Park. You’ll find a small parking area to the left just past the ranger station, or, if space is available, there are a dozen parking spots on the east side of Chuckanut Drive. A Discover Pass is required in either lot. A pass kiosk, water and flush toilets are available in the park.Because the trail sees a lot of boots, it gets a lot of trail maintenance attention from WTA. Apart from one perpetually muddy section, the wide trail does a great job of sloughing off rain. Switchbacks take the bite out of the steeper sections. Many nearby trails allow backpackers, equestrian and mountain bike use, but the trail to Fragrance Lake is restricted to day hikers and (leashed) dogs. There are “kissing gates” at either end of the trail to help with enforcement. After a mile of steady uphill hiking through old-growth forest, arrive at a junction to a short spur trail that ends at an unexpected viewpoint of Samish Bay and the San Juan Islands. Back on the main trail, enjoy a brief downhill stretch before the trail steepens on the way up to the lake. At the next junction, continue left for two tenths of a mile and arrive at Fragrance Lake. Whoever was responsible for the name must have been inspired by the tall trees that completely surround the lake, and the rich scents of bark, pine and soil they provide as the breeze wafts by.Shed your pack and have a snack! There’s a 0.6-mile loop trail along the shore that provides additional viewpoints and privacy. Rockhounds will love exploring the huge boulders on the west side of the lake. If the weather is good and the body is willing, wade in and cool your feet. Or swim out and join the trout for more frigid exercise. Head back the way you came, skipping the spur trail on the return. Strong hikers with map in hand could continue to Lost Lake to add another 5.5 miles and 860 feet of cumulative gain to their day. A car drop or key exchange hike might incorporate the recently constructed Rock Trail.

Native Americans weren't far off in their comparison, since the 848-foot basalt column once formed the core, or belly, of an ancient volcano. During the ice age, icebergs and flowing waters slowly carved away the softer exterior rock, leaving Beacon Rock sticking straight out of the north banks of the Columbia River. Lewis and Clark camped here on their way to the Pacific, and it was at Beacon Rock that they first noticed the tides affecting water levels in the Columbia River, more than 120 miles from the mouth. It was this team of explorers that gave the rock its modern name, though they were initially undecided on whether it should be ""Beacon Rock"" or ""Beaten Rock.""Its sheer walls were unscaled until 1901, and the modern trail to the top follows that original route. Climbers are still able to scale the rock today, but only on the northwest face. The rest of the rock is closed to climbing, to protect nesting falcons. From a developed parking area on the south side of the highway, the hike heads up immediately -- after all, you have 848 feet to climb in less than a mile. But the grade is surprisingly gentle, with plenty of places to catch your breath and enjoy a view. Moss covered boulders line the wide gravelled path at the base. The trail then curves around to the south side of the rock, where you encounter handrails and a sturdy boardwalk trail that switchbacs all the way to the top of the mountain. Along the way, the trail winds in and out of trees -- surprisingly huge for growing out of a rock mountainside. You'll enjoy views up- and down-river of the mighty Columbia, and far below is a boat launch and the day use area of Beacon Rock State Park. Even on foggy days, the views are interesting and the fog can add to the mystique of the trail. There is also a small lake visible in the meadows at western edge of the rock. This is Riddell Lake, accessible via a wide trailhead at the picnic area at the base of Beacon Rock. It's a nice option for folks who might not want to venture up to the summit, since it offers an interesting southern view of the monolith but beware of bugs! Roundtrip to the lake is less than half a mile. The summit of Beacon Rock features a sign offering you a congratulations on summitting, as well as an expansive view upriver towards Bonneville Dam.

Oystercatchers probe the tidal pools left behind on offshore reefs. Sea otters, once on the brink of extinction, bob in the protected coves. Whales can often be spotted farther out.People, too, have adapted to this landscape, which is often draped in fog and receives over 100 inches of annual rainfall. Directly offshore is Tatoosh Island. Named for a Makah chief, this 20-acre treeless island once served as a summer fishing camp for the Makahs. The U.S. Coast Guard first constructed a lighthouse on the island in 1857. The current structure is automated.

Views for most of your trip will be determined by the power of your headlamp, but there will be some sights on the other side. The attraction of this hike is the mysterious, dramatic tunnel itself. However, note that the tunnel is closed November 1st through May 1st, so plan your trip accordingly.After reaching the parking lot, find the trail opposite the bathrooms.

At this point, think about donning a jacket as even on the hottest summer day the tunnel stays cool, even chilly. With the damp air, water periodically dripping from the ceiling and the darkness, you will certainly feel cold without that coat. Some people will even bring gloves and a hat for the walk through. Just before entering the darkness, strap on your headlamp or dig your flashlight out of your pack. You don’t want to be looking for your light source in the dark! Did you check that they work and do you have spare batteries?Other than a slight curve to the left at the beginning, once you’re in the tunnel your hike is pretty straightforward, literally. You may even be able to see the light at the end of the tunnel. It’s prudent to remember that the tunnel is 2.3 miles long, so while the light may seem promising, the end of your hike is still a long ways off. The tunnel is wide and very tall so there’s plenty of room for all, as you go through this fascinating piece of Washington State history. The trail in the tunnel is in great shape with just a few potholes, which you can expect to find where water is dripping from the ceiling. Once through, you will find a few picnic tables, a pit toilet, a garbage can and some nice views of the neighboring Cascade Mountains along the I-90 corridor. If it’s a clear day try and find the lookout on top of Granite Mountain! After you've located the lookout and eaten a snack, head back into the tunnel for your return trip.

The entire hike is five miles in length with about 1200 feet elevation gain and loss. It is certainly one of the best hikes in the Spokane area and also a great place to snowshoe in the winter. What's more is that you have the possibility of encountering moose and elk."

From the trailhead parking, which offers about twenty spaces, hike to the bend in the road and cross it; you will see a white gate across what looks like an access road. This is your starting point. Go around the gate, and begin hiking along the access road. This is the Mount Kit Carson Loop road, which was used back in the day for Sunday drives as a scenic route around Kit Carson. Camps used to be set up all along the road, and residents of Spokane could drive to the mountain and take a long slow circuit tour via automobile around the peak. Your tour of Mount Kit Carson is a little more strenuous. After a slightly descending traverse and two creek crossings, take the trail branching off to your right, signed for trail 104. Most of the trails on this hike are multi-use, so be aware and observe proper trail etiquette. Trail 104 switchbacks up and away from the Mount Kit Carson Loop road, gaining about 500 feet in a third of a mile before meeting a junction with Trail 100. For the duration of this hike, you’ll note many side trails. All major turns in your route will be at signed junctions. Turn left onto Trail 100, which now traverses the flanks of Mount Kit Carson. You’re hiking through a quiet forest. Descend to Smith Gap, a place where Trail 100 and the Mount Kit Carson Loop Road intersect. Here you’re a mile from the trailhead, and you have the opportunity to relieve yourself in a port-a-potty, or simply have a rest at the picnic table. Be sure to visit the snowshoe hut, which is just a little ways up the hill from where you came to the intersection. WTA crew leader Randy Greyerbiehl built the white pine bench and picnic table that furnish this delightful little alpine hut from a tree that fell nearby, and locals have contributed creatively designed coat racks made from old parts of skis. Sign the guestbook and have a rest if you like, then head back to the intersection to continue on. Hike down the Kit Carson Loop road for a few hundred feet, looking for a junction to your right with Trail 140. Turn onto Trail 140 and begin a long switchbacking route up the hillside. You will pass from low, close-in forests of Douglas-fir to more open forests of Ponderosa pine. You’ll arrive at Saddle Junction, a central location that you’ll visit twice more during this hike. This time, use the port-a-potty if you need to, then start hiking on Trail 160, which takes off uphill and to your left. At a junction with Trail 130, stay on Trail 160, continuing uphill. At a second junction on Trail 160, turn left and proceed uphill for a quarter mile to your first peak – Mount Kit Carson. A granite outcropping here offers views to Spokane and the rolling hills of the Palouse, as well as the snow-capped Washington Selkirks over your right shoulder. When you’ve taken enough photos, head back down the spur trail, arriving at the junction with 160. Take the left trail. This is Trail 130, and it descends steeply for three-quarters of a mile through quiet forest. This section of the hike is the furthest from easy public access, so it’s unlikely that you’ll see many people here. If you’re hiking this loop early in the day or late in the evening, you might even see a bear, since huckleberries line the trail here. Arrive at a small saddle and junction with Trail 130. Go left, and begin climbing out through an open meadow that bursts with wildflowers and grasses in late spring. After one-third of a mile, arrive at another granite outcropping—you’re on top of Day Mountain. This is a great spot for more panoramic views and pictures. You can see the wooded top of Mount Kit Carson behind you, and views north to the Selkirks have improved. This is not the true summit of Day Mountain—that’s behind you in the trees you just came through—but it’s the best spot to take a rest and have a snack before pressing on. With two peaks bagged and the biggest yet to come, backtrack a few feet from the granite outcropping and look for a trail descending through the meadow to your left. Take this path, which is Trail 130, and begin a mile-long descent through calm forest with peek-a-boo views into Idaho. WTA worked on this section of trail, installing a rock wall to reinforce switchbacks near the trail’s junction with the Kit Carson Loop Road. Pop out on the Mount Kit Carson Loop road and hike along it for about a mile back to Saddle Junction. This time, make a 90-degree left turn onto Trail 140. 140 traverses the flank of Mount Spokane for a bit before taking a steeper grade and switchbacking through increasingly open forest. About a mile in, the trail comes into view with the Kit Carson Loop Road. A small path connects these two, which you will take on the way back. For now, continue up and up on Trail 140. Notice the dead trees that make up much of the landscape here–their stark silhouettes provide great contrast with the fluffy pines you’ve hiked among for so much of the hike. About a third of a mile shy of the summit of Mount Spokane, an open rockfield to your left is visible through the trees. This windswept field is a sacred area for the Spokane tribe. Break out of the forest onto the summit of Mount Spokane. The true summit is at Vista House, a structure up the hill to your left. A structure on the National Historic Register, Vista House has been here since 1934 and was the original fire lookout for Mount Spokane. It is operated as a concession in the winter when the ski resort is open, but is available for hikers to enjoy in the summertime. Get photos from just outside Vista House, where the mountains stretch out before you into Idaho and Washington. Scotchman’s Peak in Idaho pokes above the rest of the peaks. On clear days, it’s possible to see as far as Montana. Be sure to visit the other side of the summit, where an Eagle Scout built signs and indicators for the lakes visible from the top of Mount Spokane. Once you’ve explored the summit to your heart’s content, it’s time to head down. Retrace your steps down Trail 140 to where the Kit Carson Loop Road is visible. This time, take the connecting trail and jump on the Kit Carson Loop Road. Turn right, and look for a stone entryway to the CCC Cabin. This little detour is a nice historical sight – CCC crews built the stone steps leading up to the cabin and the cabin itself. It is currently being restored by various volunteer groups. There’s also a port-a-potty here. After exploring the cabin, rejoin the Kit Carson Loop Road and hike along it for about a half mile back to your final visit to saddle Junction. Now you’ll take Trail 110 downhill. You’ll notice that this section of trail is in excellent shape, with wide, stable tread—the section you’re hiking on now was built with the help of a crew from a nearby correctional facility.Hike two miles downhill until you arrive at a junction with Trail 100. Continue heading downhill, crossing a bridge installed by WTA crews in summer 2013. Stay on the main trail, ignoring a branching route that descends steeply to the right, and head all the way out towards the white gate that you came through to begin this hike."

The Methow Valley has long been recognized as a mecca for cross-country fanatics, but snow­shoers will find the hills and valleys of this thinly forested mountain region just as much fun.The Lookout Mountain route combines a modest warm-up hike up a narrow access road with a long cross-country climb along the open steppes of a windswept flank of Lookout Mountain. The route provides plenty of local scenery to admire and enjoy, but the real thrill is found on the upper slopes, where sweeping views encompass the majority of the Okanogan National Forest. Gaze out over the ragged crest of the Sawtooth Range to the south, admire the expansive Twisp River and Methow River valleys to the north and east, and stare in awe at the shimmering white peaks of the Cascade Crest to the west.The first 1.5 miles follow FR 200 as it climbs the west side of Elderberry Canyon toward the summit of Lookout Mountain. The ascent along this section is gradual, gaining just over 1000 feet in that distance. As the road crosses the creek and starts to climb the opposite valley wall, the going gets tougher. For the easiest approach, stick to the road as it loops south 0.5 mile before switching back and climbing north to reach the ridge top. Because the trees are thin from here on out, if you are feeling adventurous, leave the road to the skiers and put your snowshoe cleats to the test by angling up the valley wall at a steeper angle, crossing the road somewhere after it has started back from the long loop south. This will shave about a mile off the hiking distance, but it will put a burn in your thighs. Take a breather after you rejoin the road and enjoy the increasingly spectacular views. To the south, the Sawtooths are rising into view and to the north, straight up the ridge line, the small elevated wooden cabin at the summit of Lookout Mountain beckons.Take a visual bearing off the lookout cabin, and lay in a course to intercept it. The upper ridge is open meadow and generally easy going. Nearly 1.5 miles separate the upper end of the road and the lookout structure, but the slope is only moderately steep and the snow is generally well packed by the breezes that continually caress this peak.The lookout tower is boarded up for winter--no need to watch for fires when the forests are wrapped in a protective cocoon of snow--but you can enjoy a well-deserved snack on the leeward side of the building while soaking in the world-famous winter scenery of the sprawling Methow Valley.Author’s Rating: More DifficultSome previous snowshoe experience helpful. Some winter survival skills recommended (basic knowledge of avalanche evaluation, emergency shelter construction, etc.). Elevation gain is usually less than 1000 feet with a gradual slope."

Park at the Tubal Cain trailhead and walk up the road to a trail signed “Little Quilcene Trail #835” on the left. Not one to lull you into a false sense of ease, the trail starts off climbing steeply and stays that way for two miles. There's a sign at the beginning of the trail warning hikers that the grade gets up to 40% in places before the first junction--it's a burner, to be sure. Just before the junction with the Mount Townsend trail, break out onto a ridge and take in your first of many expansive views.Catch your breath and look for the Tubal Cain trail across the valley before dipping back into forest before arriving at a signed junction 2.3 miles in. Here, leave the Little Quilcene Trail, proceeding straight on the trail signed for Mount Townsend. You'll hike through subalpine forest and wide open talus slopes dotted with shrubs as you progress 2.4 miles to the summit of Townsend. Your progress is still upward, but at a much more merciful grade than the previous two miles. Just past the wilderness boundary is a fork in the trail. Either one gets you to the summit, but the right-hand trail is a more direct route. If you take the left fork, you’ll reach the second summit first, then continue to the first, generally more peopled summit. Either high point is an ideal spot to dump your pack and enjoy a leisurely lunch while taking in the panoramic views of Olympics, Hood Canal, Cascades, Strait of Juan de Fuca, Port Townsend, Seattle, and more. After chowing down and taking your photos, head south down the ""main"" Townsend trail toward Quilcene. Descend about a half mile, down several switchbacks on the south flanks of the mountain before reaching a junction signed for Silver Lake. The sign is on a tree that you may miss coming from this direction, so keep a sharp eye out to your right as you descend. The way to Silver Peak shoots off at the bend of a switchback, so instead of continuing downhill, go straight onto the trail toward Silver Lakes. From here, it's 2.5 miles to Silver Lake.Ascend through a notch, then switchback down into the woods and traverse along the valley wall, crossing Silver Creek and heading back uphill just a bit until you reach a beautiful, calm lake. After you set up camp, there are plenty of exploring options, including a second lake over the ridge across the creek. After enjoying the campsite, head back to civilization via the same trail you used to get here.WTA Pro Tip: Need those last minute items before you head off, or craving Cheetos and a cold pop when you’re done? The best gas station/convenience store with real bathrooms (flush toilets, TP and soap) is the Longhouse Market & Deli & Gas Station, conveniently located on US 101 just south of Louella Road."

All that traffic does a number on the trail, but fortunately WTA work parties have worked hard here, ensuring that all trail users can easily follow the picturesque path to Pratt Lake. The first mile may be crowded, but after passing a junction with the popular Granite Mountain trail, the crowds disperse – or at least spread out. Hike along the wide Pratt Lake Trail, crossing several sweet streams fed by snowbanks high up on the flanks of Granite Mountain. In early spring, these stream crossings can be high, even treacherous, so evaluate each crossing for safety according to your own ability. Three miles in, you’ll come to a junction. The left-hand fork leads to the Ollalie Lake Trail in just 0.2 miles, but Pratt Lake is found by taking the right-hand fork, which traverses the hillside and then begins climbing to a junction with the Island Lake/Mount Defiance Trail after 1.2 miles. Just before this junction, you’ll reach a clear spot in the trail, where Ollalie Lake lies still and green in the valley below you, and Rainier hovers straight ahead. In this open area, beargrass flourishes in early spring. It’s a great spot for a snack and photo opportunity. At the junction for Island Lake, take the right hand path that heads down into Pratt Lake Basin. All the climbing you have done from the trailhead is now reversed, as you switchback steeply down a forested hillside to open granite talus slopes. Here the trail is quite exposed – be sure to bring (and use) your sunscreen. Hike down the talus to a marshy section that sometimes requires bug juice – mosquitos and black flies can be an irritation here, but a breeze can lessen their onslaught. This marshy area opens onto yet another talus field. Stop for a moment to take in the sapphire-blue waters of Pratt Lake before pressing on. From here it’s less than half a mile to the Pratt Lake campgrounds and day use areas.WTA Pro Tip: Camping at Pratt Lake makes a great base camp for backcountry adventures, including fishing (catch-and-release), a short stroll to Lower Tuschohatchie Lake just 0.6 miles away, or a day hike to Melakwa Lake, a more demanding six-mile roundtrip hike."

Suddenly, laid out beneath your feet are the icy waters of the lake–-deep blue in the shade, bright aquamarine in sunlight–-while high above you at the far end of the lake, the twin spires of Dragontail and Colchuck Peaks seem to crowd out the very sky. And all this is within relatively easy reach. While the final ascent to the lake is steep and rough in places, Colchuck’s overall elevation gain of 2,300 feet makes its spectacular scenery accessible to hikers of almost any ability. In summer, cars fill not only the trailhead parking lot, but the road leading to it. As if Colchuck Lake alone weren’t enough of a draw, it is one of the two gateways to the Enchantments, and the trailhead also accesses Stuart Lake, an easier and equally awesome destination. Begin on the Stuart Lake Trail #1599. The first mile and a half climbs very gradually in forest, first dense and dark, then thinner and lighter, within earshot and sometimes sightline of Mountaineer Creek. Occasional breaks in the trees offer glimpses of the steep walls of the valley. At the end of this first mile and a half, the trail crosses to the right bank of Mountaineer Creek on a sturdy log bridge. On hot days, standing at the midpoint of the bridge, hikers can catch some welcome relief from the breeze coming off the rushing whitewater of the creek. After the bridge, the route steepens and grows rockier, a small taste of what’s to come over the hike’s second half. Three quarters of a mile later, the trail flattens out and drops a little before reaching a trail junction. Straight ahead the path to Stuart Lake rolls out, while the Colchuck Lake Trail #1599.1 breaks off to the left. Follow the trail to the left and after a short stretch in the trees, come to another log bridge that takes you across a narrow, turbulent section of Mountaineer Creek. The trail is a bit of a jumble as you hop boulders in a large talus slope along the creek’s bank. A short distance later you near the creek again, but here its waters turn suddenly glassy smooth; a nice spot for a meditative pause before starting to climb once again. At first, the trail switchbacks gently, but the closer it gets to the lake, the steeper and rockier it gets. At several spots along the way, views open up, first to the valley you’ve just climbed out of, then up to the toothy ridge of Dragontail Peak. After one final steep stretch, the trail takes a jog to the right, drops into a small swale and suddenly, there you are at one of the finest lake views in the Cascades. The trail seems to end at a broad granite face overlooking the lake. This is a great place to grab lunch and take in the scenery. Immediately across the lake is the imposing massif of Dragontail Peak. To the left of Dragontail is Aasgard Pass, the climb that serves as the unbelievably steep “shortcut” to the Enchantments. To the right are the remnants of the Colchuck Glacier and the slopes of Colchuck Peak, its true summit tucked out of view behind rocky towers. The trail continues along the lakeshore another two thirds of a mile, at times rough and a little hard to follow. One of the least obvious route junctures is at a large tarn -– it’s a common mistake to follow the well-trodden dirt to the right, but the trail actually proceeds over rocky slopes to the left. After a series of bends and ups and downs in the trees, the trail reaches a rock field at the bottom of the terminal moraine of the Colchuck Glacier. Here, subalpine firs give way to larches, and the formal trail gives way to a rock-hopping route that eventually heads up Aasgard Pass. WTA Pro Tip: There are campsites all along the lakeshore, but be aware that camping here is managed under the same strict regime as the core Enchantment Zone -– overnight stays are by permit only from May 15th-October 31st."

Strip off the boots and continue southward with the sand in your toes. After 1.3 miles of beach walking you cross Petroleum Creek. Campsites can now be found around the beach and in the sheltered forest upslope.Continue the last stretch to the Point of Arches, a mile-long parade of rocky sea stacks. Wander the tide pools and observe the daily goings on of the resident coastal critters. Drop your pack and spend your time relishing being in one of the most scenic locations in the Northwest.NOTE: Overnight backpackers will need TWO permits: a Makah Recreation Pass and an Olympic National Park wilderness permit (available in Port Angeles or Forks). As with all coastal hiking, use a tide table to plan your visit, and always be aware of surf conditions. Make sure you camp above the high tide mark."

Beautiful forest, a rushing creek, waterfalls of all shapes and sizes, history, and of course a large blue-green lake surrounded by snowy peaks. At 10.4 miles, it can be either a day-hike or a quick early season overnight. You won’t be alone, though – this is a popular trail with both hikers and backpackers.The trail starts at the far end of the large parking lot. In just a few minutes, come to a well signed junction for the Upper Elliot and Lower Elliot trails.  They’ll rejoin in approximately three miles, so the choice is yours. Consider taking one trail to the lake, and the other one on the trip back to your car.The trail to the right drops down to the creek.  You will be on a twisty trail surrounded by conifers, alders, ferns and skunk cabbage. The first mile or so is close enough to hear the creek and periodically enjoy peek-a-boo views of it. The tread is soft, and the stream crossings are small with stepping stones that may be partially submerged in the early season.The trail to the left follows an old road. It is straight and wide, with a mild but constant uphill and then downhill grade. The trail consists of an old layer of packed gravel, and is lined with alders. Stream crossings are more difficult early season, but still manageable. There is an eroded culvert in one of the streams that is a little tricky to navigate, so take it slow and if you feel unsafe, don't go beyond your ability level. If you opt for the upper trail views along the way will be of jagged peaks, two really nice waterfalls, small patches of wild strawberries, and lots of bleeding hearts. Be sure to avoid the Chokwich Creek Trail, which branches off to your left at 3.6 miles from the trailhead. On the trip back to the trailhead, you might not even notice this junction.Shortly after the trails rejoin, the way gets a little rocky and the grade steepens. As you switchback up the hillside, keep your eyes and ears open for a large waterfall on your right. Continuing uphill, arrive at the root-ball of a large fallen tree. The trail switchbacks to the left here, but the adventurous will want to take a quick side trip to the right. There was once an old wood-planked road here and a bridge across the river to an old town site. The bridge is gone, but there is still a rushing waterfall worth visiting. You’ll have to contend with some fallen trees, but none of them are too bad.After a bit more climbing, reach a well-signed junction just before the lake.  The campsites and two open-air privies are to the left. There are at least 15 sites here, though none of them are particularly private. The forest is open and the camp resembles a terraced hillside. The trail to the lake continues to the right. After a short distance, arrive at a signed day-use area. This is your best bet for a lunch overlooking the lake, or for letting your kids run around. Even though the trail is popular, there is some room to spread out here."

With huge extinct and active volcanoes on the horizon and an unbelievable bounty of flowers in the spring and huckleberries in the fall, Jumbo lives up to its name--stunning surroundings on a grand scale. Starting from the Sunrise Peak trailhead, head southwest on the rough trail. It's a short but steep slope for about three-quarters of a mile to a lovely viewpoint featuring Mount Adams to the south, and ahead of you, Jumbo Peak's jauntily placed summit block slopes away to the northwest. Continue along the trail--now quite a bit flatter than what you just ascended--wending your way around Sunrise Peak's flanks to a junction one mile from the trailhead. Your route lies straight ahead, though the trail heading up to Sunrise Peak is a worthy diversion if you have the time. If you do, it's two miles round trip, including a bit of scrambling to achieve the very top. If you elect to head straight to Jumbo, proceed along the trail in front of you, gently descending for 0.3 miles to another T junction. Turn left here, the right hand trail is the multi-use access to Sunrise Peak.Continue your gentle descent to where the trail flattens out in a hanging valley. If you're doing an overnight, this is an excellent spot for dispersed campsites, but take note that there is unlikely to be any water here.Hike through the flat section and begin climbing yet again, now on the flanks of Jumbo Peak. The trail is moderately to steeply graded, but views northeast to Rainier and Sunrise Peak keep you distracted and there are plenty of photo opportunities. Round Jumbo's northern flank and continue to a saddle with in-your-face views of Mount Adams. From the saddle, the trail begins yet another climb to a false summit, but don't lose heart! Once at the false summit you'll have your first breathtaking views that will stick with you to your lunch spot. Now it's a relatively flat meadow walk through unbelievable vistas in every direction. In spring, beargrass, paintbrush, and phlox dot the meadows and in fall, you'll have more than enough huckleberries to fuel your hike. This route doesn't actually go to the summit of Jumbo, but rather circumnavigates it. Head around the west side of the mountain, enjoying views of St. Helens along the way. The trail here becomes quite narrow in places. Remember that this is a multi-use trail, and in the Dark Divide, that includes motorized vehicles, so be aware of the possibility that you may meet oncoming trail users and observe good trail etiquette. Soon you'll arrive at an open meadow with rocks--great for sitting and snacking while enjoying the views all around you. Adams, St. Helens, and the Goat Rocks are visible here, as well as Dark Meadow and Holdaway Butte nearby.WTA Pro Tip: Jumbo Peak can also be accessed from Dark Meadow or other feeder trails. Consider including it in a long traverse of several trails in this area and enjoy ever-changing vantage points of this incredible area."

At 1.1 miles is a junction. Go straight to start on the Ptarmigan Ridge trail. Crest over a ridge then drop 200 feet (now lower than the parking lot), to pass below a rugged rock face, then reattain the ridge on the far side.Contour below the ridge top on the southeast side, climbing gently for half a mile, through a talus slope that often holds snow late into the season. At 2.9 miles, crest over the ridge at 5630 feet and change directions from southeast to due west. Weather permitting, Coleman Pinnacle and Mount Baker dominate the view to the west. The visible trail shows a continuing gentle ascent.Pass beneath Coleman Pinnacle on slopes that usually retain snow patches late into the season, arriving at a junction 3.8 miles from the trailhead and at 5950 feet. The views here are fantastic, making this a popular resting spot and the destination for many day hikers.To the south is beautiful green Goat Lake. The large plateau leading to the lake offers camping when water is available. But the trail down (once melted out) is loose, gravelly, and treacherous for the first 500 feet.Should you go further? From here, the trail changes abruptly, both in direction and in character. It turns right, getting narrower and steeper as it climbs quickly to 6100 feet. Then it drops slightly over the next half mile, passing nondescript Camp Kiser along the way.You can glimpse The Portals, the prominent rock formations known to climbers of Mount Baker’s northeast side, and access for the Park Glacier climbing route. At 4.5 miles and 5970 feet is a plateau suitable for camping, and what maps show as the end of the trail.Beyond the plateau, a primitive boot trail continues up the rocky hill: East Peak (also known as The Portals East). It does not lead to climbing routes, but rather climbs above them to 6500 feet over 1.1 miles, fanning out into numerous social trails before dead-ending at a precipice with sheer drops. The up-close views are outstanding, but the path requires route-finding skills and possibly mountaineering experience (depending on snow conditions). Each hiker must decide where their stopping point is, before returning the way them came.Note: The term “The Portals” is used to identify the rock formations flanking the climbers’ route. But they are also known by various names and compass directions, such as “West Portal” or “The Portals South” or “Portals East Peak”."

Though the campground is seasonal, the trails are open year round. Bring the dog and the kids, stretch your legs, and take in some fantastic scenery located 4 miles south of Quilcene, immediately off of Highway 101.You have two options; one is quite easy, and the other a little less so, but still manageable for even young children, though you may be giving shoulder rides on the way back.  If you're looking for the easiest route, head right. This is a flat 0.1 mile loop that will give you a picture perfect shot of the falls in its entirety. If anyone in your group is afraid of heights, you may want to brace yourself. There is a fence at the viewpoint, but you can still see the dropoff. However, this trail offers the best unobstructed view of the falls you can find here. The more challenging route is available to the left. From the trailhead, drop steeply, about 200 feet in a tenth of a mile, into the canyon with lots of switchbacks, and railroad tie “steps” to guide you around corners. At the bottom, a great picnic or relaxing spot awaits, with boulders to climb, a quiet pool to cool your heels (it’s very cold), and a view of some moderate rapids on the Big Quilcene River.  If you want to continue on -- and you should -- cross the little wooden bridge over a creek, and follow the river up through the second-growth coniferous forest and under a green canopy of deciduous trees. The further up the river you go, the bigger the rapids become, and the raucous river noise is never out of earshot even when you cannot see it. Intermittent views through the forest will reward you white rapids surging around huge mossy boulders. At about a half-mile in there is a wooden bench placed by the forest's trail department. Take a seat, take a pull on the water bottle, and take some pictures of the river below you, then thank the trail crew for being so awesome!Continuing south, shortly past the bench, you will arrive at a fork in the trail. The right continues along the river, the left rises slightly through more woods closer to the highway (you can hear traffic passing by) but it all loops together and no matter which way you choose, the trail will bring you right back to the bench. When you return, backtrack past the bench and down the way you came to the base of the canyon. Remember all those switchbacks? Here they are again at the finish, and there's only one way to go but up. It’s a bit of a work-out, but there's no shame in taking a break to search for furry forest friends or snap pictures of the green and silver mossy trees while catching your breath. Once you get to the top, congratulate yourself for taking the time to enjoy this gorgeous trail.WTA Pro Tip: Until the campground opens in late spring, you can park outside of the gate, and walk around it into the campground. Veer left through roughly paved roads and moderate winter debris until you arrive at the marked trailhead. Also note that in winter and early spring, there are no open restrooms here, either."

You will come close to the new trail on a hairpin near the end of this segment, but keep left to avoid the crowds. You will reach the junction with the new trail along a turnpike segment. Take careful note of this unmarked junction-—it's important for your return trip. If you miss it, you'll to return to the wrong parking lot! Join the new trail here, and head up some more. Soon the haystack will hove into view. The basin and the haystack at the top of Si, along with panoramic views of West Defiance Ridge, the Snoqualmie Valley, and Puget Sound are only 0.2 miles away. On your descent consider taking the segment of the Boulder Garden Loop that you missed on your ascent to complete a round trip of 7.4 miles.WTA Pro Tip: Hike this trail during the winter or on weekdays to experience more solitude."

Start with a couple miles of gentle up-and-down, through forest coated with thick mosses, with glimpses of a crashing river that’s an ethereal shade of blue-green. Then begin steadily climbing up switchbacks, the beginning of your journey through an aging forest fire, and on to views of a verdant river valley rolling out at your feet. An added bonus – this is one of WTA’s most frequently-visited trails. Trees in the burn area fall routinely, so the access you enjoy to these surroundings is thanks to volunteer crews who visit this trail year after year to remove them. Begin from the trailhead parking area and immediately head gently uphill along a wide, rocky tread through thick forest. A creek runs along the inside of this former roadbed, so WTA crews have installed drainage structures along this first mile of trail, to keep the small stream from eroding the trail away. As the trail curves around to the left, take in the enormous bigleaf maples that line the way, and listen to the wind sighing through the trees. After a mile, pass a sign indicating The Brothers Wilderness. Descend a short hill, then follow the trail as it flattens out through some stunning fir and pines. WTA wields their tools here as well, evening tread and providing sturdier footing for hikers. Two miles from the trailhead you have your first glimpse of the Duckabush River. Hike alongside this mighty river, which may be silty from spring runoff, or crystal clear in winter. Head upstream about half a mile before an enchanting glen opens up before you. Hikers are dwarfed by enormous cedars, and pillowy moss spreads out in all directions from your boots. Soon you’ll begin climbing Big Hump. The first assault is a series of tight switchbacks on black rock dotted with colorful lichen to an overlook. This is informally known as 'Snack Rock'. Have a bite, then continue here through a large section of the 2011 Duckabush Fire. This is where WTA work crews have made their mark. Each year, at least three backcountry response teams make the trek back here to log out hundreds of trees that fall to winter storms. In 2015, a crew even headed up for a soggy weekend in November and removed 80 trees over the course of four days! The trail meanders through this area, then continues switchbacking uphill to the crest of Big Hump. Enjoy views from the top, and look down, on the north side of the hill. There’s a camp down there, 650 feet down and about 5 miles from the trailhead (hence its apt name, Fivemile Camp). If you’re looking for a good picnic spot, head down there. Otherwise, take in the views and head back the way you came."

It’s a long journey at about 7.5 miles, and steep in places, but nothing a healthy dog, child or senior citizen can’t do. You’ll meet all of these smiling folks on this hike during the peak seasons.Located in the Columbia River Gorge Natural Scenic Area within Beacon Rock State Park, Hamilton Mountain can be tackled one of two ways. Try hiking it straight up and down for a six-mile roundtrip, or take the loop for a 7.5 mile round trip. Either way, it’s a great trek.It’s a steady easy pace for the first mile up the wide, well-built trail.  In addition to avid hikers from Portland, Vancouver and elsewhere, you’ll encounter incredible old-growth Douglas fir along this stretch. Wildflowers love this mountain, and you might want to check the trail sides for tasty wild strawberries in the late spring.  At one mile in, you’ll likely hear the waterfalls before you see a trail heading down to the Hardy Falls viewpoint. This is a steep little pitch, and the views are mostly obscured by trees, so if you’re into the big cascading falls, keep on going until you see a side trail leading up to Rodney Falls and Pool of the Winds.  The upper falls is protected by a rail, but you can get close enough to feel the spray. From here you’ll see the lower falls, so head back down to the main trail and catch the falls from below for some great views and photo ops. The rigid Columbia basalt rock makes its presence known at the falls, as these carved rocks stood the test of time through catastrophic floods and landslides that scoured the gorge for the past 15 million years.  The trail gets a little steeper past the falls, but there are some rugged stairs that help out.  At 1.3 miles in, the trail intersects Hardy Creek Trail where the sign declares “Hamilton Mountain - More Difficult” and “Hardy Creek Trail - Difficult”.  Take the “More Difficult” route and continue counter-clockwise up the Hamilton Mountain Trail, switchbacking up for a 1400 foot climb to the top. You can take the Hardy Creek Trail for a 3.2 mile route clockwise to the top to complete the loop, but the better route is to take the Hamilton Mountain Trail up. Plus, it’s easier on the knees coming down the Hardy Creek Trail.    When you reach the top of Hamilton Mountain three miles up, you’ll be rewarded with panoramic views of the photo-worthy Cascade peaks, but it you continue another .75 mile northwest on the narrower loop trail, a prominent ridge will provide even better views! Wildflowers are in abundance up here.  Most people descend the same way they came up, but for an extra 1.5 net gain in mileage, you’ll explore the west side cool lush forest and likely will have it all to yourself.  The northernmost part of the trail is four miles in, where a well-marked sign points the way to the Hardy Creek Trail, shared with equestrians. From here, you’ll descend along an old road bed part of the way. There are signs of black bear in this lesser-used area, so you might want to make a little noise so as not to surprise any if they happen to be hunting for berries near the trail. Near Hardy Creek, there is a picnic table and major trail intersection with a trail sign. Take the left trail (southeast towards the Hamilton Mountain Trail) and continue on this hardy trail that boasts tremendous log retaining walls and bridges along the slick hillsides. After 1.4 more miles, you’ll intersect the Hamilton Mountain Trail and will turn right to descend back to the parking area, unless of course you want to climb back up to the top!"

The Meadowlark trail (2.6 miles) stays closer to the lake and the feeder stream, crossing the diversion canal at the south end using small rock steps. You can simply slosh through the water -- a refreshing respite on a particularly hot day. The Whitetail Trail continues up to the north end of the canal and crosses there, adding about a quarter mile to your total distance. From the north end, the Whitetail trail heads to the south end of the diversion canal, then begins zigzagging along the property line, while the Meadowlark Trail sticks closer to the stream that feeds Bennington Lake. Alternately, the Kingfisher Trail is just 1.7 miles, and follows a moderate grade along the north and south sides of Mill Creek itself."

It's a long meander through the Tigers, passing near the high points but not going to any of them. As the raven flies, Custer's Bridge is less than three miles from the trailhead. By the TMT it's nearly eight. So why hike this route? Along the way you hike through deciduous, coniferous and mixed forests on both the shady north side and drier south side of West Tiger; past areas where the decaying stumps from old logging are evident, through moist areas with small creeks and an abundance of ferns and shrubs, and other areas where the forest canopy is so dense that little grows in the understory. Look for, and appreciate, these differences as you do the hike.In season, you may find many forest wildflowers. In early spring look for trillium, yellow violet, bleeding heart and coltsfoot; a bit later miner's lettuce, vanilla leaf, salmon berry and red currant; in late June or early July, goatsbeard, foamflower and thimble berry. Many others, less common, are out there. Perhaps take a few photos, then consult a wildflower guide when you get home.As a tribute to volunteers who had major roles in building the trail in the 1970s, certain locales were dubbed with folksy names such as Anschell's Allee, Ruth's Cove, Pete's Pass, Hopping Bridge, etc. A few of these names - only a few - are shown on the Green Trails map. All, initially, were identified by rustic signs posted along the TMT. Also, small markers were installed each mile to indicate the distance from the south end. Sadly, in recent years many of these signs and markers have disappeared, their fate unknown. Look for a few remaining ones on your hike.From the parking area, follow the signs and hike the wide gravel trail 0.1 mile south. At the signed fork, turn left toward the W. Tiger #3 Trail and the Tiger Mountain Trail. In a short distance, turn left again at a rustic sign, this time onto the Tiger Mountain Trail (TMT) itself.The route starts out fairly level, then gains elevation with many switchbacks. In 1.25 miles the trail straightens and begins a long southward stretch along one side of a narrowing canyon, termed Anshell's Allee. Just beyond the Allee, cross two tributaries of High Point Creek on secure bridges. After the two bridges, come to an intersection with the K3 Trail. It's signed ""unmaintained,"" but it's maintained by volunteers so is as good as any trail in the Tigers. From here, the TMT makes a long loop to the east then loops back west at a higher elevation. The K3 takes a shortcut across that loop. It's steeper, but it's 1.5 miles shorter. Well, you are out to hike the TMT, aren't you? So don't cheat. Of course, if you hike far enough on the TMT, you can keep K3 in mind for your return leg when saving that extra 1.5 miles may seem very welcome. (If you take K3 on your return, the round trip to Custer's Bridge is about 14 miles.)About a half-mile farther, come to the first crossing of High Point Creek. A few years ago a bridge here was heavily damaged by flood waters and blowdowns. An impressive 200-foot steel span was constructed in 2015 to replace it.In another 0,1 mile, come to the T-junction with the High Point Trail (it arrives here from I-90, Exit 20, by a different route than the TMT.) At this point, you have come 2.6 miles from your trailhead and, for an easy hike, this is a possible turn-around point.Or press on an additional half mile, passing a signed junction with the Lingering Trail, to reach Ruth's Cove. It's a pleasant spot where a new small bridge crosses a tributary of High Point Creek. In spring, skunk cabbage blooms here. Ruth's is a nice place to pause for a break. It's just over three miles from your trailhead, and is another possibility for a turn around.A couple of hundred feet past Ruth's Cove, look on the left for a very small fir that often is decorated with a few holiday bangles, even in summer. It's one of two (at least) such trees in the Tigers (another is near the Bootleg Trail above the Paw Print Connector.) It's not known who keeps up the decorations, or who sometimes removes them.Continue on to Fred's Corner, a trail junction in an area of tall maples. While you are there, look up in the trees. It's not unusual to see a few wild pigeons - very different birds from their urban, street-smart cousins. The trail forks here, with the West Tiger RR Grade heading left and the TMT going right. In 0.3 miles the route starts to level off. Formerly, the TMT crossed High Point Creek on a bridge here, then traversed a former landslide before coming to a junction with the West Tiger RR Grade and continuing on uphill. If you have hiked this part of the TMT before you probably remember this section and your map may still show it as the route.In early 2014, the bridge was removed and in the summer of 2014 an entire section of the TMT was rerouted to avoid the former landslide and to bridge High Point Creek at a more secure location upstream.Before reaching the former bridge site, the TMT now turns left (uphill.) Take this newly- constructed section of the TMT and soon cross High Point Creek on a new, very secure bridge. Climb a bit more, then enjoy a nearly­level section of trail that meets up with the old route at the upper end of the K3Trail. Keep the K3 in mind for the return leg of your hike.Continue on (up) to Tom's Crossing, actually a T-junction. At about 2,500 feet, it's the highest point along the TMT so you have come up about 2,000 feet from the trailhead. In spring, look for red currant blooming here. (From the junction, the West Tiger #2 Trail climbs steeply, gaining another 270 feet, to reach that summit.) Stay with the ongoing TMT as it drops a little, passing though a section of forest with a dense canopy and little growth in the understory. In 0.3 mile from Tom's Crossing, reach Pete's Pass where the TMT crosses the ridge between the West Tiger #2 and #3 summits, each less than a quarter mile away.Press on five minutes to Manning's Reach where a very small bench offers room for one or two hikers to sit. There is a minimal view through the trees down to the lowlands, although tree growth is shrinking even this window and it may disappear in a year or two. Manning's Reach is another of the high points on the TMT and, like Tom's Crossing, has an elevation about 2,500 feet. If you continue on to Custer's Bridge you will drop about 440 feet - and have to regain it on your return. If this is unappealing you could turn around here.Or continue on 1.25 miles to a junction with the One View Trail (a route to Poo Poo Point, or to the High School Trail.) Then, in another 0.1 mile, come to Larry's Crossing and the intersection with the Hidden Forest Trail (Left, uphill, goes to the West Tiger #1 summit, in about a mile. Right, downhill, connects with the Fifteen Mile RR Grade and, eventually, the West Side Road.) In another on 0.1 mile on the TMT come to the fancifully-named Hopping Bridge crossing a small, seasonal stream. Yes, there are a few rabbits in the Tigers, but it's unlikely you will see any here.Continue on a bit more than a mile, passing Dieter's Spring and, at about 7.25 miles from the trailhead, reach Lone Rock, a glacial erratic boulder perched quietly amid the trees next to the TMT. If your previous Tiger hikes have included the Talus Rocks Trail then you have seen boulders of comparable size. But those, on the moist north side of West Tiger, are heavily covered in moss. Lone Rock, here on the drier south side, is not so adorned, and the characteristics of the stone can be appreciated more readily. Take a close-up look, run your hand over it, and perhaps scramble part way around to compare the different sides. Then consider whether you might want to turn around here.Or you can continue on, about another half mile. Drop down a hundred feet or so and cross the signed Fifteen Mile RR Grade. Drop a bit more and, a couple of minutes later, come to Custer's Bridge. It's as remote a spot as you are likely to find anywhere in the Tigers, in terms of distance to a trailhead. So you might have it all to yourself.The bridge, located near the midpoint of the TMT, is a low, rustic structure crossing the head of Fifteen Mile Creek. In spring, look along the banks for skunk cabbage. In summer, when the vegetation is so thick you may have difficulty seeing down to the water, look for ripe salmon berries and a few wildflowers. Any time, spring through fall, the bridge is a pleasant stopping point. Sit a while, sip and snack, and relax to the soft sounds of the flowing stream.If you haven't turned around already you really should now. You've hiked half the TMT, some would say the better half. It's almost eight miles back to your trailhead (less if you take K3,) and you have to regain the 440 feet of elevation you dropped getting here from Manning's Reach. Perhaps you have caught ""TMT fever,"" that uncontrollable urge to see what's around the next corner on the TMT? That's OK. It happens. Come back tomorrow, or in a few days. Start at the south end and hike north to Custer's Bridge. Then you will have experienced it all. Better yet, collaborate with a friend, arrange a car shuffle, and do the entire TMT as a through hike starting at the south end. It's a worthy adventure."

To get to the trailhead, either take the Lady of the Lake ferry or your own boat to Lucerne and dock at Refrigerator Harbor. Once there, hike along the Railroad Creek Road #3100 east for about one quarter mile to the Domke Lake #1280 trailhead. You will be able to see Chelan, the third deepest lake in America, from several look out points along the way. This trail is also great for beginning backpackers, as it is only 3.5 miles to the top with a moderate slope. Alternative routes include heading through Emerald Park, 7.6 miles one way or Holden Village which is 13.5 miles one way.Once you reach the top of the trail you will walk past a house dwelling up at the lake. Don't be afraid, that is just Sid, a former Park Ranger who is now retired and takes care of the lake cabins up there. He lives there in the spring, summer and fall months before heading down lake during the winter. If you are staying, you can rent a rowboat or a small motor boat to take out on Domke Lake and explore. There are several camp sites at Domke Lake, but make sure to bring your own water or water filtration system as well as your own toilet paper for the outhouse. If you have the opportunity to stay the night, you will hear the buzz of the forest and see many forest critters such as, chipmunks, bats, owls, crickets, frogs and other birds. Large predators like bears and cougars have not been spotted in quite some time but it is not to say that they haven't been seen before. Same goes for the occasional raccoon or skunk. None that Sid has seen and you can always check with him to get the latest scoop."

This pleasant ridge romp works well as either a dayhike or an overnight backpack. The trail starts high and gradually descends, remaining in the forest for the early miles, then breaking out onto the high Sawtooth Ridge with fantastic views of the surrounding countryside. The wilderness here is so untrammeled that the trail begins to disappear into the underbrush after the first 3 easy miles. Watch for the spur trail to Burnt Flat and Lady Camp at an unmarked intersection at approximately the 3 mile mark. The camp is nearly a mile off the main trail. Nearby Lady Spring is difficult to locate and may dry up later in the summer, so hike here at the height of wildflower season for the best chance of finding sufficient water.Back on trail, use your map and compass to continue, and when in doubt, remain on the ridgetop. At approximately the 4 mile mark, a green-and-white sign on a large tree marks the boundary between Washington and Oregon, a good turnaround spot. According to Forest Service maps, the trail continues another 10 miles to the Wenaha River, but on the ground this trail may prove too difficult to locate. WTA Pro Tip: Near Sawtooth Ridge, in 1826, naturalist David Douglas made the discovery of North America's first known wild peony. Watch for its low blooms of mauve tinged with yellow hiding among the showier flowers along the route."

As you gain elevation, wide views taking in Mount Adams and Mount Rainier open up. The lower portion of the trail to Ape Canyon starts parallel to a wide lahar flow and climbs through one of the only remaining swaths of old-growth forest on Mount St. Helens, this with Douglas-, silver, and noble firs. After climbing for a few miles, the trail emerges from the forest onto a wide volcanic plain that offers jaw-dropping panoramas in all directions. The glaciated St. Helens resides directly in front of you, with clear views of Mounts Adams and Rainier in the distance. After a short distance, the trail comes to the precipitous edge of the trail's namesake rock formation, named after a possible Sasquatch sighting in 1924. Continue across the plains of light-colored cinders. The trail ends at the Loowit Trail but by wandering north on the Loowit, you can increase your mileage all the way to the Plains of Abraham trail, with huge views of Mount St. Helens eastern flanks, where colorful summer wildflowers dot the barren landscape.WTA Pro Tip: The Ape Canyon Train is popular with mountain bikers, who like to start at Windy Ridge and ride southward (downhill) across the plains.

However, ice axes, trekking poles, and crampons or microspikes (depending on the season) are required to summit. Hikers who put this investment in will be rewarded with stunning views on a clear day, as well as the satisfaction of having made it up one of Washington's five volcanoes. Many climbers attempt this mountain over two days, beginning their ascent from the trailhead and heading to the Lunch Counter for the first evening. With an early morning wakeup call, they reach the summit early in the day, when the snow is still sturdy from cold overnight temperatures, and head down after snapping some summit shots. It is also possible to camp below Crescent Glacier in the Morrison Creek drainage, to avoid crowd that can form at the Lunch Counter. Begin at the South Climb Trail (183), at the end of a rough forest road (8040-500). Note that the last three miles past Morrison Creek Campground is very rough and narrow, so drive carefully. If you are coming late at night, you may consider camping at Morrison Creek to avoid a late-night car-to-car encounter on the road. From the trailhead, follow an old road bed through the 2012 Cascade Creek burn zone. In times of high wind, this can be a dangerous area, and there is very little shade until you arrive at a stand of trees near the intersection with the Round The Mountain trail. Luckily, this is only about a mile in, and on relatively flat trail, it doesn't take long to arrive there. Because of the exposed nature of the hike, you'll want to bring plenty of water, and consider refilling when you cross Morrison Creek. The summer route up Adams, beyond Morrison Creek becomes rocky and rough. Be sure to have sturdy shoes, since the tread is loose, and can slide out underfoot in steep sections. Traverse this section, then arrive atop a ridgeline northwest of Morrison Creek. The trail continues to climb relentlessly until you reach the snowfields below the Lunch Counter. Continue up to the Lunch Counter. Along the way, there are ample opportunities to throw down your tent, if necessary. Potential tent sites dot the trail from Morrison Creek on. Again, you'll want to be sure you have enough water, or fuel to melt snow, since water sources here are spotty at best.  From the Lunch Counter, it's another grueling climb to Pikers Peak, but that's not all -- Pikers Peak is a false summit that nonetheless can take hours to reach. The wind here can be quite strong, so while you'll be pooped when you reach it, you may not want to stick around too long for your snack break. But you'll want to have some sort of refueling stop before pushing on to the summit. It's a hefty push to the summit cone, and like most mountain climbing ventures, it's thin air towards the top. From the summit, you can see Mounts Jefferson, Hood, St. Helens, and Rainier, and Baker on a clear day. Other peaks spread out in front of you, and despite the chill you may feel from the near-constant breeze at the summit, you'll want to be sure to take plenty of pictures and soak it all in before heading down. WTA Pro Tip: A Cascade Volcano Pass is required May 1st through September 30th for anyone hiking above 7,000 feet, whether or not they are making a summit push. It is $10 for weekday trips and $15 for trips taking place Friday-Sunday. These may be purchased at the Mount Adams Ranger Station in Trout Lake or at the Cowlitz Valley Ranger Station in Randle. If you won't be going above 7,000 feet, then only a Northwest Forest Pass(purchase at ranger station) and Wilderness Permit (free, self-issue at trailhead) are required."

From the trailhead, the path immediately enters a forest of impressive silver fir, red cedar, and Douglas-fir, where lush mosses and lichens grow underfoot. Huckleberries and ferns line the trail, as do a wide variety of wildflowers: avalanche and fawn lilies, queen's cup, trillium, columbine, and bear grass. Church Creek, though clearly heard, remains out of sight in a deep ravine. By way of switchbacks, the trail climbs steeply toward the South Fork Skokomish and Wynoochee River's divide. As you cross a series of streams, look for marsh-marigolds, shooting stars, pioneer violets, and fairyslippers. At about 1.5 miles, reach a decommissioned road and follow until the route rejoins the trail. The climb resumes, and after about 0.5 miles, arrive at the 3200 foot divide. Near the crest, a massive western hemlock stands guard. Beyond the sentinel hemlock, the trail rapidly descends through silver fir and western hemlock. Beyond a cascading waterfall, the trail makes a few sweeping switchbacks and emerges at the northernmost and largest of the five Satsop Lakes. A trail wanders along the lake, passing through thick swaths of willow and salmonberry, and continues to FR 2372.WTA Pro Tip: Spend a full weekend exploring the trails of the southeastern Olympics.

The trail from here to Independence is short but rough with plenty of large roots, rock and mud to navigate as well as a few unnecessary and steep downs and ups. However, these bumps will soon be forgotten when you start glimpsing the lake.

Or are there four trails to the top because Mount Townsend is so popular? Let’s just agree it's a popular hike and that there are many reasons for it. Townsend offers rhododendrons in May and June, wildflowers in June through August, then berries in August and September and fall colors in, well, fall.  Add in old growth, some tucked away waterfalls, and a windswept, alpine turtleback summit with views north across the Strait and San Juans, west and south into and along the Olympics and east across the Sound to the Cascades, and you've got the perfect year-round hike. No wonder it is popular.The most loved of the routes up Townsend starts at what is commonly referred to as the ‘Upper Trailhead’. The ‘Lower Trailhead’ on this route starts 1.2 miles and 400 feet elevation farther down the valley. It can be a good access option when snow has closed higher elevation roads. The trail starts out accompanied by the crashing of Townsend Creek and soon switchbacks through old-growth with a thick understory of rhododendrons.The track makes a long westward-rising traverse through fir and hemlock, interrupted by three ravines. These ravines get progressively more open both up and down their drainages, providing peek-a-boo views across the valley.  Shortly after the trail breaks into a broad, sloped meadow, stop and listen.  You may be able to pick out first the sounds and then sights of a couple small waterfalls. The more obvious one drains off of Townsend and the other off of the Welch Peaks to the southwest.Switchbacks resume in this open area and take one from meadow to forest and back to meadow. The open views to the east offer better and better views across to the Cascades. Shortly before Camp Windy the trail crests an open rock face that brings most hikers to a brief halt to enjoy the views and the moment. At 2.6 miles down the trail, overnighters can enjoy Camp Windy as a nice camp spot. The water source, shallow Windy Lake, is a great reflecting pool for the surrounding trees and cliffs.The switchbacks above Camp Windy bring you to the intersection with the Silver Lake Trail at 3.0 miles. Swing right to stay on route to Townsend. Soon you'll find yourself in open country punctuated by clumps of krummholz skirted subalpine fir.Take your pick of any of the outcrops at the south summit of Townsend (four miles from the trailhead and at 6,260 feet of elevation and enjoy the views in all directions. Use the rocks for a windbreak during your well-earned rest and snack before heading back.Wondering where the other three trails to Townsend are? Silver Lakes Trail approaches from the west, and is reached via the Silver Lakes Way Trail. The other two approach from the north: Little River Summit from the northeast and Dirty Face Ridge from the northwest. The trail up Dirty Face Ridge (shown on maps as the Little Quilcene Trail) shares a trailhead parking area with the Tubal Cain Trail on FR 2870. WTA Pro Tip: For a fun loop hike, start on the Dirty Face Ridge Trail, summit Townsend and head south on the 839 trail until you meet the Silver Lakes Trail and take it over the pass and down into the Silver Lakes valley. Then turn north on the Silver Lakes Way Trail. This trail ends on the 2870 road that you follow back to your vehicle."

The folksy name is a reference to the steam whistle sounds heard throughout the Tigers in the early days of logging. More recently, around the 1970s, the area around Poo Poo Point was logged by its then owners, Weyerhaeuser Corporation. The result is a large clear area used now as a launching pad by paragliders who generally backpack their lightweight gear up the Chirico Trail, or sometimes arrive by minibus.From the parking lot, take the obvious trail across the landing field. Be alert for any paragliders who might be coasting in quietly to land. At the eastern edge of the field enter Tiger Mountain State Forest and find yourself on the Chirico Trail.The first part of the trail, with its steep, forested hillside and many stone steps is very picturesque. If it strikes you as akin to stepping into a classical Chinese landscape painting, you are not alone. Appreciate the magic. This steep face of Poo Poo Point is known as the Yah-er Wall. As you continue a steep traverse across the Wall the trees become smaller and more spaced out, and the hillside-but not the trail-becomes less steep.Farther along, impatient hikers have, over the years, cut some of the corners. To minimize erosion please try to follow the official trail.Continue hiking in regenerated forest and, at about 1.6 miles, come to the South Launch Viewpoint. This  open area sometimes is used by paragliders, and it is a good place for a short break while you enjoy the unobstructed view of Mount Rainier, clouds permitting.Then continue on another quarter mile, gaining 140 feet, and reach Poo Poo Point and its North Launch Viewpoint.The gravel road you see arriving at the Point is the West Side Road, one of several non-public service roads that begin at the Tiger Summit on Highway 18.The Point is a great spot to sit, have a snack and enjoy the view northwest across Issaquah and Lake Sammamish toward Bellevue's downtown. To the west are Squak and Cougar Mountains, with a hint of Seattle's tallest buildings showing beyond. On a clear day, more distant mountains may be visible. If your timing is right you can enjoy watching paragliders launch from the steep northwestern face into the sky .There are two picnic tables at the Point, and there is a Clivus toilet. There is no regular water source."

Geologists say the rock formation is the result of erosion from a great flood near the end of the last Ice Age, about 12,000 to 15,000 years ago.A Cayuse legend states that the natural monument was formed when Coyote, an animal spirit, fell in love with three sisters, then became jealous of them and turned two into stone. The third was turned into a cave, says the legend. Regardless of the reason the pillars were formed, the trail here--though short--provides some remarkable adventures. From the area at the base of the Twin Sisters Rock to the highland area rocks to the south, you'll enjoy amazing views of the Wallula Gap on the Columbia River.Yes, this is a short hike, but it offers a lot in that short distance. This trail offers a great study of the geology of the Columbia Basin, as well as an introduction to the desert flora--which is easy to see here as the plethora of desert blooms push right up against the trail (and the access road).From the trailhead, an old-fashioned stairlike stile gets you over the fence at the trailhead. The trail leads up a steep gully to a junction. Going left at the junction takes you up to the base of Twin Sisters--be careful of the loose rock here. Going straight takes you back behind to the east side of Twin Sisters and great views of them. Small sand dunes nestle along the base of the pillars. About 0.5 mile out, you'll find a fence and marker of private land behind it. Don't cross the fence. Hike to the highland just south of Twin Sisters and enjoy the stellar view of Wallula Gap."

Here there are rocks to sit on and water to splash in on hot day. Of course, be aware if you’re with little ones—this is a river after all—but enjoy the water and the sun-warmed stones and then continue on.Just after departing the trailhead, you’ll arrive at a fork. The right-hand trail heads steeply up to the rocky bluffs of Polallie Ridge, so unless you want a thigh burner, keep left and stay close to the river. While the river plays hide-and-seek along this stretch of trail, wildflowers keep you occupied. Look for arrowleaf balsamroot, trillium, calypso orchids, vanillaleaf, lupine, and Indian paintbrush, among many others.When you tire of examining the forest floor, look up. The old-growth forest you’re walking through is populated by cedars, white pine, Douglas-fir, and vine maples, whose bright reds and oranges are stunning in autumn.Two miles from the trailhead, pass another good riverside sitting spot and follow the trail as it flattens out in open forest. In late summer, you can stop for a trailside snack—berries grow here along with more wildflowers near the river. You’re nearly to your destination of Cooper Lake at this point, and the undulating trail just keeps going – there is hardly any elevation gain at all.WTA Pro Tip: Lunch spots along Cooper Lake are plentiful, but the best are a half mile along the Pete Lake Trail, which skirts the northeast side of Cooper Lake.If the group feels up to it, press on to Owhi Campground, where you can lay out a picnic and enjoy views of Chimney Rock’s photogenic summit block."

This makes its peak easy to point out to your friends when you say, ”I was up there.”Mount Ellinor also gives you two trailheads to choose from. The lower trailhead at 2,600 feet welcomes you to the ascent with an easy grade at the outset. The route from the upper trailhead at 3,500 feet starts out with a nearly immediate upward jolt. Both routes show off the skill and diligence of the Mount Rose Trail Crew in improving and maintaining the trails.Note that while a Northwest Forest Pass is required at the upper trailhead, hikers do not need one to access Mount Ellinor from the lower trailhead. From the lower trailhead, you’ll enjoy a 6.2-mile round-trip that starts in old growth. The trail climbs with gentle switchbacks, traces the edge of a recovering clear-cut, then it flirts with a ridge edge. Several ridgeline openings-–one with benches--give broad views across Lake Cushman and far to the southeast.From the upper trailhead, the round-trip is 3.2 miles. The more important figure to note for this route is the 2,444 feet of elevation it gains in the 1.6 miles to the summit. The track ascends a set of stacked switchbacks for 0.3 miles until it meets the lower trail.The trails from the upper and lower trailheads merge at 3,900 feet and from there the trail continues upward at the same character-building grade of the path from the upper trailhead. More switchbacks and many with stairstep risers that add to the grade. The trail moderates briefly at the well-signed junction with the winter climbing route before heading up to the first of several panoramic viewpoints.  Stopping to admire the views at each of these is a great way to catch your breath. The trail breaks out of the trees and rises onto rock-strewn slopes and across gravelly meadows before heading through a notch and continuing upward on the west facing slopes. Take time to contemplate the new view into the southern Olympics.  Just below the summit, the trail swings around to the east facing slopes. The summit area has 360-degree views and is also popular with salt-seeking mountain goats."

A wide path switchbacks gently at first and then just a little more steeply uphill through old- and second-growth forest to a large lake ringed by silent sentinels--huge old-growth fir trees that keep watch over day hikers and campers who elect to stay overnight at this wilderness refuge. Beginning at the trailhead, an inviting path leads uphill into the forest. Roots and rocks are present, but for the most part, the way is smooth, and you’ll enjoy the sound of Lena Creek crashing downhill until a long traverse takes you away from the big stream. But you’re hardly leaving water. All along the way, waterfalls, streams, rivulets, and small drips cross the trail, keeping WTA volunteers busy each year building drainage ditches to keep your feet dry. Where the creek crossings are large, bridges provide not only a dry crossing, but also photo opportunities looking both uphill and down. One mile from the trailhead you’ll enter a forest made up of more old-growth than second-growth. Carry on, keeping an eye out for a truly enormous boulder; a glacial erratic from eons past. Shortly after the boulder, find yourself on a beautiful bridge that crosses a dry gully! Take some photos from this unusual crossing, and then continue on to a fork about three miles from the trailhead.The right fork takes you down to the lakeshore just a few hundred feet, but hiking along for roughly one-quarter mile leads you to a beautiful overlook of Lena Lake. You can’t access the lake from here, but it’s a great spot to stop and enjoy lunch, laze in the sun, and get some good shots of the large lake below."

Cross over High Point Creek and, where the pavement ends, find the signed beginning of the High Point Trail. The trail loops around tiny High Point Pond and heads south, gaining about 200 feet in 0.3 miles before reaching a power line.A sign here indicates ""Lingering Trail,"" with a single arrow pointing south along the route. But you're still on the High Point Trail. The sign is there because this is the former location of a junction with the Lingering Trail. That trail has been rerouted, and you now will pass the junction 100 yards south of the power line. (The Lingering Trail is an option for your return hike.)Continue south on the High Point Trail about 0.4 miles, come to a signed junction with Dwight's Way, turn left and climb a few steps. Continue on Dwight's Way about 0.7 miles, crossing over the Lingering Trail.Dwight's Way has some gentle ups and downs with a net gain of about 100 feet. Along the way enjoy some of the nicest second-growth forest in the Tigers. Cross small streams on rustic bridges and, in one case, on a large log. Appreciate the exuberant growth of moss and ferns, and note occasional huge stumps, remnants from logging a century ago.Reach a signed junction with the Preston Trail (formerly the ""West Tiger No. 1 Trail,"" a name your Green Trails map still may use.) At this point, prepare for some uphill. You'll gain about 350 feet before the grade begins to level off.After 0.4 miles on the Preston Trail you might notice a faint trail merging with your route on your left, but you would be forgiven for thinking it's just another path where water runs off the trail. Actually, it's the route shown on your map as the Lower Bootleg Trail, a path that arrives here (via part of the Preston Trail) from near the D.O.T. Highway Facility on SE Preston Way. Also, it's part of a route by which a few mountain bikers access these trails, even though the trails officially are closed to bikers. You might not encounter bikers on your hike, but you could see tire tracks here, and along the ongoing Bootleg Trail if you return via that route.Continue on another 0.1 miles and come to a signed trail junction where the Middle Bootleg Trail heads off left. The ongoing Preston Trail, your route, climbs steeply uphill to the right. Gain about 500 feet in a half-mile, cross over a gently rounded knoll, and enjoy a brief stretch of downhill. But it's elevation you will have to gain back.At the low point, where the uphill resumes, note an old railroad grade heading left with a faint path visible along it. If you are here on a future hike and feel adventurous that's a path you could explore. It's rudimentary, but it does go through to join the Bootleg Trail. For today, just stay on the Preston Trail, climb another 100 feet and reach a signed trail junction where the West Tiger RR Grade arrives from Fred's Corner. By now you probably are thinking this hike has a lot of uphill. It does, and there's more. Stay on the Preston Trail and climb another 600 feet in a half-mile to reach a signed junction with the upper end of the Bootleg Trail. From here, the ongoing Preston Trail continues west below a ridge top. In 2014, the slope above the trail was clear-cut. Trees at the edge of the trail now are subject to the full force of storm winds, and there have been some blowdowns.As of early 2015, this part of the Preston Trail was completely blocked by a massive blowdown. (Check recent trip reports for the current status, and for any advice.) In less than a quarter-mile, come to a signed junction with the Poo Top Trail. Here, to reach the summit of W. Tiger No. 1 (or as close as an electronics tower will allow) you need to take a short side trip. Hike up the Poo Top Trail, gaining about 75 feet on four short switchbacks to reach a high point next to a large granite boulder. At 2948 feet, this is the second highest summit in the Tigers (only East Tiger, at 3004 feet, is higher.) It may seem somewhat anti-climactic, both because of the adjoining tower, and because there is no view. But don't despair! You soon will have your view. The Poo Top Trail continues on south to meet up with the Hidden Forest Trail, but that's for a different hike! For today, turn around and take the Poo Top Trail back down to the Preston Trail (from this side the sign says it's the Bypass Trail, because it bypasses the electronics.) Turn left and continue west on the Preston/Bypass Trail a quarter mile. Pass through some very dark forest and emerge abruptly into the bright sun (clouds permitting) at the Hiker's Hut Viewpoint.The hut itself is a small, round metal structure that might serve as a very basic storm shelter in winter. A graveled service road arrives here from the west to reach the electronics gear, and a bench is available across the road. Sit and take in the view. On a clear day, Mt. Rainier will be directly in front of you and of a large swath of the Olympics will be visible to your right. While you are at the viewpoint, you may be visited by a few gray jays. Humming birds also often are seen here and, in summer, large dragon flies. In spring, check the surroundings for wildflowers such as lupine and tiger lily (a few years ago tiger lilies bloomed right under the bench!)When you have had your fill of the view, and finished your lunch, it's time to think of returning. Either return the way you came, possibly taking the optional Lingering Trail, or see below for another possibility.Extending your hike*As of Spring 2015, a sign at the upper end of the Bootleg Trail, at its junction with the Preston Trail, indicates the Bootleg Trail currently is closed due to ""Logging Hazard.*On your hike up to W. Tiger No. 1 you passed two ends of the Bootleg Trail, so it's an obvious option for your return hike that will add about a half-mile to your distance.If you decide to return that way then, when you reach the junction at the upper end of the Bootleg Trail, turn right, follow it a short distance below the ridge top, then begin to descend steeply. At the point where the trail steepens, another short trail arrives from the right. It just leads up to the ridge top service road. (If, in the future, you are hiking the Bootleg Trail in the uphill direction, be alert for this unsigned junction near the ridge top, and watch for a large red arrow painted on a tree trunk to indicate where the Bootleg Trail bends west.)Descend the Bootleg Trail another 0.6 miles and approach a junction with the Paw Print Connector. Above the junction you might notice, off to your right, a small fir tree that sports holiday decorations, even in summer. It's one of two (at least) such trees in the Tigers (another is along the TMT above Ruth's Cove.) It is not known who adds the decorations, or who sometimes removes them.Continue down the Bootleg Trail. Eventually, it reaches another old railroad grade and abruptly levels out. The trail may seem to go both directions along the railroad grade, but the left branch is your ongoing trail. The right branch used to be very indistinct, but in recent years it has enjoyed more traffic and become more visible. It connects with an old logging road that is shown on your Green Trails map.Beyond the railroad grade, cross the East Fork of Issaquah Creek. Generally, this is an easy crossing on stones although the water level can be higher after a recent heavy rain, or when snow is melting above. After the crossing, continue down the Bootleg Trail to reach its junction with the Preston Trail. Follow the Preston Trail back to Dwight's Way, and return to your trailhead.Optionally, along Dwight's Way, when you come to the crossing of the Lingering Trail you can turn right and take it back to rejoin the High Point Trail above the power line."

One of those is the south Lost Lake trail, which in turn has two options for starting the hike. One starts close to and the other starts from the Lost Lake (formerly Clayton Beach) parking area near the entrance to Larrabee State Park. The slightly more scenic but longer route follows the Fragrance Lake trail. Hike the trail for 2.3 miles until it reaches the service road. Turn right on the service road and go 0.1 mile until you reach the Lost Lake hiking trailhead on your left. You can also walk directly from the parking area, following the service road. Pass a cascading waterfall at 0.8 miles, and 1.2 miles later turn right at the sign for the Lost Lake hiking trailhead.The Lost Lake hiking trail proper follows the route of an old logging road in a southeasterly direction for 1.25 miles, steadily gaining elevation with occasional switchbacks. WTA has recently (November 2014) worked on this section to prune brush and improve drainage in this high-rainfall area. Along this segment, ascend to a high point of 1650 feet with views of Samish Bay in the winter. You will then start to descend, coming to a sign at a junction, indicating that the route to Lost Lake is to the left. If you do take the fork to the right, you will reach a clear-cut vantage point in 0.1 mile where you can look down upon the entirety of Lost Lake.Proceeding left at the above sign, continue north 0.6 miles to a small waterfall, and then the junction with the Rock Trail, on your left. Continue straight ahead; the lake lies 0.6 miles beyond. As you pass red cedars and hemlocks, marvel at old growth, munch on salmonberries if they are out, and stare at the rock walls to your left. When you reach the lake, at 1200 feet of elevation, continue upward again briefly and reach the junction with the north Lost Lake trail. Turn right to double back and find a large rock that offers views of the lake, and explore the waterfall at the outlet. Enjoy your time beside the lake’s calm, evergreen-encircled waters.WTA Pro Tip: the many trails of Larrabee State Park need your help! The rangers do not have adequate staffing to maintain the trails on their own, so consider volunteering for a WTA Work Party to preserve this trail and others so that they may persist into the future."

On your right, a boardwalk crosses a marsh and leads you to a flat grassy field and a picnic area. This is the site of an old hotel, but not much remains now except a large chimney. To reach the viewpoint into the caves, continue straight, crossing the Stillaguamish River on an aluminum bridge high above. Look down and notice the old trail below. WTA helped create the new, higher trail you're walking on and the bridge was installed in order to withstand the flooding and washouts that have plagued this trail in the past.

You will now have a good view of Big Four Mountain and the waterfalls sheeting down the cliff face. Turn from the mountain for a minute and check out the wildflowers beside the trail. In late spring you will see trillium, then valerian, queens cup and some nice stands of bright magenta fireweed. You now have your first view of the caves. Formed by melting snow, waterfalls from the above cliff and wind, they are really snow caves under an avalanche chute. Inviting as they look on a warm day, there are signs everywhere warning of the danger. Do not go into or climb on top of the caves! Other hikers may  be doing just this, so parents, have your “Just because everybody else does it…” speech ready. The signs are there for a reason; people have been killed here as recently as 2011 by avalanches in the spring and collapsing snow bridges in the summer. There is a plaque at the end of the trail in memory of Grace Tam, an 11-year old girl who was killed in 2011. It serves as a reminder of the ever-changing nature of this area, and the potential for danger that the melting ice holds. The trail ends in a circle of rocks perfect for safely admiring the caves, Big Four and the surrounding beauty. On your way back to the car, take the boardwalk across the marsh, watching for birds, dragonflies and frogs. Have a picnic, check out the old hotel site and call it a good day.

In 2014, King County made a land purchase on the west side of Squak Mountain, with the intention of creating a forest preserve.Named in honor of Margaret MacLeod, a park planner for numerous local, state and federal agencies, whose long career resulted in the preservation of hundreds of acres of land along Issaquah Creek and Squak and Tiger Mountains, Margaret's Way is a delightful 2.5 mile forest ramble along wooded hillsides and near rushing creeks. Beginning from the Squak Mountain Lodge, the trail heads through the parking and camping area using old access and logging roads before becoming true trail. Roads once laced the upper reaches of the mountain, but these are now mostly overgrown with moss-laden bigleaf maple, cedar, western hemlock, and a few Douglas-fir, thanks in part to MacLeod's work to preserve this area. Once you step onto the trail itself, you'll wend your way along a hillside, continuing on a moderate grade through green underbrush and silent sentinel trees.Debbie's View, a delightful lookout point with views of Mount Rainier and the surrounding foothills makes for a great rest/turn-around spot.  Where Margaret's Way ends, turn right on Chybinski, then another immediate right on Perimeter Loop, and watch for a sign to Debbie's View."

A railroad once ran along the canyon, passing through small communities. Logging was done in the area, and lime once was produced from limestone here, in a kiln that still stands. The railroad and communities are gone now, and much has disappeared over the past eighty years. But a few artifacts still remain and can be seen near the trail.The trailhead and much of the hike lie within the Robe Canyon Historic Park. Information about the park, and historical photos, are presented on a two-sided bulletin board at the trailhead. It's good material, although some of the text is printed in a relatively small font size, and glare from plastic covering the photos can make viewing them a challenge in some lighting conditions.The route begins with a gentle climb of about 200 feet, followed by a gradual loss of about 600 feet before reaching a longer, nearly-level section along an old railroad grade. In fact, most of the elevation gain occurs on the return hike. The route crosses both public and private land, and the footing varies from old road beds to narrow, stony trail. There are numerous signs along the way, so route-finding is not a problem.Begin your hike in a forested area, with an exuberant growth of ferns below. Then venture out onto a former road that traverses private property. In late summer, you may find a few ripe blackberries - not the native variety - beside the trail. The route leaves the road and heads downhill on a narrow, stony path passing close to Hubbard Pond. But the undergrowth near the trail is quite dense and you may have difficulty seeing the water.The route widens again, crosses a sturdy bridge and continues along another old road before turning left onto a narrow trail and heading downhill. You will hear the sounds of a creek off to the left, hidden beneath a lot of vegetation. The sound of flowing water increases as you approach the South Fork of the Stillaguamish, where the trail meets and continues along the former railroad grade.Signs along the grade offer bits of history, including the route and dates of the Everett and Monte Cristo Railroad, the location of the former community of Cutoff Junction, and the site of a former logging spur railroad. Artifacts of various kinds appear near the trail. Some are easily identified, including remnants of a cast iron stove, broken pieces of rotary saw blades, old bricks, and a bent length of steel rail. Many of these items are quite photogenic. Feel free to take photos, but please leave the artifacts for future hikers to enjoy. At one point the trail turns up a side canyon, climbs just a few feet, then crosses to the other side. Soon, the lime kiln looms up rather abruptly on the right, a short way off the trail. It's about 20 feet tall, with considerable moss and ferns adorning the sides. The overall form of the kiln and the shape of the arch on the side first seen from the trail, combined with the very green mossy surroundings, invite comparisons to a Mayan jungle ruin.The kiln was built in the 1890s and used until the early 1930s to convert local limestone into ""lime,"" i.e. calcium oxide. The product was transported by the adjoining railroad, mostly for use as a ""flux"" to promote melting of ores in smelters in the Everett area. The limestone apparently was loaded into the open top of the kiln from carts that approached from the uphill side. Unfortunately, none of the loading structure remains. The kiln has stoking ports on three sides where fires would have been tended--gathering sufficient dry wood as fuel in this very moist area must have presented a challenge!Beyond the kiln, the trail follows the railroad grade upstream another 0.7 miles, where a sign directs hikers left for the 0.2 mile ""River Shore Loop,"" or right for the ""Railroad Bridge Site and End of Trail."" Actually, you can go either way. Each branch of the trail loops back on the other, and part way around the loop there is a signed side trail that leads 150 feet to the site of the former bridge that once crossed the Stillaguamish, though nothing now remains of the bridge.The loop trail does descend to the stony river bank for a close-up view of the water. In late summer or early fall the water level is low, the river flow is calm, and a bit of sandy beach may be exposed. But in winter or early spring the river can become a torrent and should be approached cautiously."

Covering 1,463 acres of forest, ponds and meadows, the area is named for homesteader Mitchell Lord who farmed the area in the late 1880s. Hikers can roam all day on the network of trails leading through the forest, down to the Snohomish River and up to views of the Cascades and Snohomish valley. Explore, and keep an eye out for the wildlife that live in these woods.There are hundreds of possible adventures at Lord Hill. Try the loop described below for a full day of exploration. If that's too much, try the short Beaver Lake Loop which follows Beaver Lake to the Pipeline Trail, then to the Main trail and back to the parking lot. A longer option is the trail that borders the Snohomish River. Whatever you choose, be sure to have a map with you as you plan your route. The many wanderings to be had here start off as you leave the parking lot on the boardwalk trail. Head either left on the Main trail or right on the Beaver Lake trail, either way is good. The Main trail will lead to the junction with the West View trail. Follow that, and it will lead to a nice loop and a viewpoint on Devils Butte, with nice views looking north across the valley to the mountains. The Beaver Lake trail heads down to hit the Pipeline trail, the most direct north-south route. This description will follow the Pipeline, taking you by several ponds, old quarry sites, and eventually to the Snohomish River. Once you reach the intersection with the Beaver Lake and Pipeline trails, take the side trail down to Beaver Lake. Here the lake is filling in with grass and becoming more like a marsh. You can continue along a trail around Beaver Lake, but as of this writing, this trail is not on any maps. If you don’t feel comfortable just poking around without direction, stay on the Pipeline trail, which meets up with the Temple Pond loop trail. Are you in an exploring mood? Take the route around the east side of the lake, skirting the park boundary above the lake in a wooded area. Keep following the trail through the woods, cross a little outlet stream and head up. You will see signs marking this the Red Barn trail, but again, it does not appear on a map. This area was logged at least twice, once of its old-growth trees, then again of the second-growth. You can still see some big stumps with springboard notches, now serving as nurse stumps for red huckleberry. Because the trees here are third-growth forest, enough light comes through for sword fern and salal to thrive. Eventually this trail comes to a 'T' junction with the Temple Pond loop. Take the left fork and head to Temple Pond, the biggest pond in the park. Reach the shores of Temple Pond after a nice stroll through the forest. The remains of old stumps, clumps of cattails and reflections of the surrounding trees are certainly photo-worthy. Try to capture a picture of a few of the resident ducks. With a little luck, you may see a beaver. Once done, finish the loop and end up back on the Pipeline trail.Once back on the Pipeline, follow it downhill, zigzag past a tiny pond where there is an intersection. If you're looking for a shorter hike, you can loop back to the trailhead here. To lengthen your hike, keep going downhill toward the Snohomish River. Here is another intersection with the Pipeline loop, which makes a loop through the woods here. Go straight down a steep little hill and hit the Quarry trail heading to the west, an unsigned intersection at this writing. This interesting trail takes you past a big grassy bowl that used to be an old quarry, past a large pond, then up and around a ledge above the pond where a nice bench awaits you and your trail snack. Keep following the trail north and it eventually hits the Main trail. The Main trail goes west, then south to the Snohomish River. Eat lunch by the river and watch for eagles above.Following the Pipeline trail to the end will bring you to the southern trailhead off of Tester Road. Follow the River View Quarry trail along an old road. Look for some old rusted equipment along this stretch of the trail. The grass is too high for good river views, but you can make your way down to the river bank from the old road. Loop back and hit the Quarry trail, then proceed to wander at will, eventually ending back at the main trailhead.

If you are introducing someone to hiking, limited on time, or trying to add on another hike or activity in the area, this is the hike for you. The trail begins in a gravel parking lot just after entering the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest from the west. It's actually more like a glorified shoulder off Highway 2. The trailhead is located on the west side of the parking area. An information kiosk is located about 20 feet up the trail from the parking area, but there are no facilities, so make your pit stop prior to arrival.Once on the trail, head east, paralleling the highway for a short time before turning left and heading away from the road. Remember that it's only a 1.3-mile hike to the lookout, so feel free to take your time; you'll be gazing up at the massive building soon enough. As you walk through the woods, enjoy the greens of the ferns and moss. Listen to the birds signing and keep an eye out for squirrels and chipmunks scurrying about. Appreciate and note the well-maintained trail, worked on as recently as 2013 by WTA trail crews.The trail is a tranquil walk in the woods until right before you reach the lookout where you are presented a view of the mountains on the other side of the highway. You may be tempted to stay and soak in the views, but turn around and you will see the lookout; there are much better views from up there!There has been a lookout at this location since 1925 with each lookout getting a little taller. The latest improvements were done by the Everett Mountaineers. Thanks to them, hikers can reap the rewards of their hard work by climbing the 89 steps to a viewing area, where you can have a snack while enjoying the views of the valley.Weather permitting, you'll be able to feast your eyes on Mount Persis and Mount Baring. See if you can spot Bridal Veil Falls cascading down the side of Mount Index. For those who might be a little nervous going up those stairs to the lookout, there is a picnic table nearby that you can rest at, just be sure to ask the rest of your group to take lots of pictures so you can enjoy the view from the lookout as well."

It occupies only 15 acres, but offers a close-up view of ponds and wetlands at the head of Brookside Creek, plus a half mile of trails that climb up 120 feet to loop over a forested hill. A separate section of the park to the southeast serves as a wildlife sanctuary, and currently has no trails.Look for wildflowers here in the spring, and in October enjoy the fall colors. Often you will see waterfowl foraging in the wetlands. Squirrels are common on the forested slopes, and occasional sightings of larger fauna have been reported, even deer and coyotes. A variety of birds including woodpeckers and owls nest here.From the small parking area, walk 200 feet north on the wide graveled shoulder of 30th Ave NE. The beginning of the boardwalk will be obvious on your left. You can read the informational signs and follow the boardwalk out across the wetlands for 400 feet or so to reach a viewing platform. Depending on the season, a few waterfowl may appear for you. Please don't offer them scraps of food. The wetlands already provide enough of their natural diet.Brookside Creek, a former coho salmon stream, has its source here in the wetlands. The creek flows into other creeks that drain into Lake Washington, and signage indicates there are hopes the annual salmon run can be restored in the future.When you are ready to explore the rest of the park, return to the parking area and head west on the graveled trail. Short side trails on the right offer views of Brookside Creek and nearby wetlands. About 500 feet from the parking area note a trail merging from the left. That will be your return route. A short way along, another tail branches off to the left. That trail provides a steep shortcut to the highest point of the hill. For a slightly longer, but more scenic route take the right branch instead.Farther along, where the main trail switchbacks sharply to the left near a park bench, you will note a less-used trail that seems to continue on to the right. If you like, you can explore it for 100 yards or so. It once led out to NE 168th St, but erosion has cut a deep, steep-sided ravine across that trail, and the route now has warning signs posted on both sides of the ravine proclaiming ""Keep Out Unstable Area,"" so it would be prudent to turn around and return to the main trail.As you continue, your route is bordered by a mix of deciduous and coniferous trees. At the highest point, a short side trail leads left to a sitting bench. (Note the steep, shortcut trail arriving at the high point from below.) Continue right on the main trail and begin your descent back to the trailhead. Be alert for more wildflowers on the way. In spring, you may be treated to the sight of a piece of blue eggshell on the trail, indicating a new generation of songbirds is being raised nearby. And it's likely you will hear a lot of birdsong during your visit here.The park was created through efforts of the Lake Forest Park Stewardship Foundation, and other concerned citizens, beginning in 1998. For a history of the preservation efforts, and some photos, explore the links on the Foundation's website at www.lfpsf.org.

Ingalls Peaks reach high above the lake on the one side, while Mount Stuart stands majestically to its northeast. There are few places as lovely as this. Follow a boot path around the far side of the lake for a different, beautiful perspective.WTA Pro Tip: Be prepared on summer weekends to share this wilderness wonder with other outdoor enthusiasts. It’s a destination that cannot be denied. In the fall, the larch trees turn an electric orange which will surely draw the eye.**Note that dogs are not allowed at Lake Ingalls.

The trail boasts over 75 varieties of wildflowers, evidence of an old mining operation, and vantage points into the Cascades from two different passes - one is unnamed, the other is Fortune Creek Pass.The trail begins at the end of the North Fork Teanaway Road. Follow the trail as it meanders along an old mining road to a junction with the Ingalls Way and Longs Pass Trail (1390) in less than half a mile. Continue straight and wander through trees, then meadows, cross streams, and gain elevation, making long switchbacks as you go. In the summer, flowers are prolific in the meadows and along streams which cascade gently down the often rocky and otherwise dry terrain. The wide, old roadway eventually narrows as the trail climbs higher along the hillside. Eventually, the trail skirts the slopes of Ingalls Peak as it heads northwest. Approximately 3 miles from the trailhead, an intersection with Trail 1226 heads north to a pass overlooking Lake Ann. Taking this trail to the overlook is worthwhile, and adds just about 2 miles to your trip and nearly 500 feet in elevation. Otherwise, continue hiking straight, staying on Trail 1394. It travels the side hill until finally reaching the barren ridge which is Fortune Creek Pass. The views here open west to Hawkins Mountain, Mount Daniel and Hinman to the northwest, and if one scrambles the rocky hill to the south of the pass, Mount Rainier can be seen in the distance beyond Gallagher Head Lake. Of course, Ingalls Peak is showcased immediately to the north, a different view than many hikers get from its more visited other side."

Koppen sits on an easily accessed ridge line which lacks the crowds of many of the other hikes in this area. Commanding views of the Stuart Range, and further away, the Pacific Crest make for stunning scenery. Although this trail’s rewards are an end unto itself, it may also easily be combined with numerous other peaks, ridgelines, or drainages for longer loop trails. From the rustic DeRoux campground you will ascend the multi-use DeRoux trail 1392 for about a mile and a half. Thimbleberries can be thick through here in the summer. The North Fork of the Teanaway and DeRoux Creek merge shortly after you’ve gotten underway; sturdy bridges are present so the raging waters are easily crossed in the springtime. After about 1.5 miles, bear left at the signed trail junction and head uphill on trail 1392.1. Going straight will take you to Gallagher Head Lake and to other trails up Esmerelda and Hawkins Mountains. Your trail now switchbacks significantly as it climbs 850 feet in about three-quarters of a mile on a very steep hillside. Large outcroppings of serpentine rock will start to appear near the top. This shiny greenish-black rock was formed in subduction zones in contact with salt water millions of years ago. Upon reaching the saddle, take a left turn towards the south. The Koppen Mountain trail 1225 to the summit is not marked but can be easily found after passing through two campsites on the ridge. This old trail climbs quickly through light brush. There are a few blow downs and stretches that can be very steep. Reference your map if the trail peters out. The views just grow and grow now. The hillside is draped in fabulous flowers in the spring and snow can last into early summer many years. Be sure to budget time for lounging on top as the views are superb and you aren’t likely to meet anyone else here. There was a brief history of this peak being a fire lookout, but its one year stint in 1933 left no remnants. There are a number of extensions to this hike for the adventurous.

Further complicating things, the glorious views prevent hikers from devoting their full attention to the trail--there's just too much beauty and natural splendor to enjoy. Great meadows stretch out all around, and on every horizon stand picture-perfect mountain ranges, with the hulking presence of Mount Stuart to the north dominating all others. Enjoy these sights, but make sure you give plenty of attention to the route too, and don't be afraid to turn back and hike out the way you came if you lose the loop.The trail angles northwest along Beverly Creek for 0.5 mile before the path diverges (the right is your return route). Go left to stay alongside Beverly Creek, and in the next 2.2 miles climb the steep, narrow valley of this creek to a junction with a small trail on the left.Leave the creekside here and climb steeply to the right (north) to reach a pass (elev. 5600 ft) separating Beverly Creek basin from Fourth Creek basin, 3.3 miles from the trailhead. This pass sits on the spine of the Wenatchee Mountains, below the craggy rock summit of Iron Peak. One look at the mountain's reddish hue explains the name--the iron-rich rocks have oxidized (rusted) to a russet orange.From the pass, turn right and follow a long traverse to the east, looping around the head of Fourth Creek basin and climbing slowly to a high pass (elev. 6387 ft) between Fourth Creek and Hardscrabble Creek valleys. The trail then drops to a junction with the Hardscrabble Creek Trail at 5.1 miles from the trailhead. The trail to the left descends Hardscrabble Creek, and while it can be narrow and brushy, it is generally easy to see.Straight ahead, though, our path plays hide and seek in the broad fields of rock and wildflowers. The trail can be hard to follow, but by maintaining an easterly heading and staying at the 5900-foot elevation, scramblers can work their way across the 2-mile stretch of trail between the Hardscrabble and the Cascade Creek Trails. Enjoy the views down into Ingalls Creek valley and across that valley to Mount Stuart and the jagged line of the Stuart Range.Once you reach the junction with the Cascade Creek Trail at about 7.2 miles, turn right and hike south, descending into the Stafford Creek valley. After about 1 mile you'll encounter the Standup Creek Trail. Turn right once more and follow this path up and over the ridge between Stafford and Standup Creeks, and cross the pass on the flank of Earl Peak.At 5800 feet the trail splits, about 10.5 miles from the start. The main, easily followed trail drops along Standup Creek, but the faint, hard-to-follow path you want cuts west along the flank of Earl Peak and drops steeply into the Bean Creek basin, where you'll find a junction with the Beverly Creek Trail.

The result was worthy of the name. But the ""geyser"" part did not last, and the flame, at first several feet high, soon dwindled to a few inches. Today, even that is gone. But visitors can view a small, still active, bubbling geyser, enjoy views of the Green River, enjoy a strikingly beautiful forest and, in spring, a luxuriant growth of wildflowers.The hike suggested here visits the site of the flaming geyser and the bubbling geyser, and includes the River Trail and Ridge Trail, all encompassed in the park. It follows roughly a figure eight path that can be traversed in any order. If you are a weekend visitor, you may need to park where space is available and modify your route accordingly.If possible, park at the eastern end of the park road, near the small turn-around loop. Walk past the steelhead rearing ponds (in the spring, a few small fish may be visible) and continued on to the site of the eponymous flaming geyser. While the gas flow rate now seems too low to sustain a flame, you may note the faint odor of sulfur fumes in the air - an indication the underground source is not completely dead.Cross the bridge over Christy Creek and turn right up the side trail signed Bubbling Geyser. It's about an 0.15 mile hike, with some steep up and down, partly on rustic stairs, with a net gain of about 150 feet. In spring, an impressive variety of wildflowers grow along this route. Please stay on the main trail, and avoid social trails that contribute to erosion.The official trail ends at a small viewing platform next to Christy Creek. The ""bubbling geyser"" is a small pool along the far side of the creek, not much larger than your bathroom sink. Like the flaming geyser, it resulted from prospecting holes drilled down into gaseous coal deposits. If you watch closely, you are likely to note a few bubbles bursting at the surface of the water every few seconds. Note too the greyish deposits of calcium carbonate that line the stream here.To continue on to the River Trail portion of your hike, return to the main trail near the bridge and, at the unsigned trail fork, take the right branch (It's the official River Trail. The left branch leads about 200 yards to the bank of the Green River at a spot where rafters and tubers sometimes launch for a ride downstream.) The River Trail continues upstream about a half mile, with occasional side trails that lead to views of the river. (You will note a short section on the right side of the trail where interesting layers of sedimentary rock are exposed.) It is not unusual to encounter occasional short muddy sections along the trail, particularly in the spring, but these generally present only minor problems. In season, look for wildflowers, and be alert for an occasional stinging nettle overhanging the trail. The official trail ends at the river bank, although a rough fisherman's route may continue on a short way upstream. There's a good view of the river here, and of the steep, cliffy north bank.To continue on to the Ridge Trail, return to the parking area and head west about 0.1 mile along the creek. A number of signs here comment on the fall salmon and spring steelhead runs in the Green River and its tributaries. Across the road from the playground, and just left of a large bulletin board, note a very rustic sign proclaiming ""Trail."" This is the current east end of the Ridge Trail that formerly connected with the Bubbling Geyser Trail until that route was blocked a few years ago by a landslide.The trail begins next to a wetland where you may see geese, ducks, redwing blackbirds and seasonally, some skunk cabbage. The route then heads steeply uphill, climbing about 200 feet before leveling off and heading west. In spring, look for the buds and blooms of ball-head waterleaf and, farther along, Scouler's corydalis.At an unsigned trail fork, head right and descend to a small parking area next to the road at the west end of the picnic area. If you prefer, you can check the map and explore the left trail branch that continues on and joins the equestrian tails at the west end of the park. Then hike back through the picnic area along the river to reach your car.Extending your hikeThe park map reveals an additional trail that approaches the Green River from the north side. If you want to check it out, leave the park the way you came, turn right on SE Green Valley Road then, in about a half-mile, turn right onto SE 354th Street. This gravel street descends steeply, passes a home, and ends at a small parking area. (A Discover Pass is required here too.)A wide trail begins past a closed gate, and leads across an open grassy area near a picturesque old barn. It drops a few feet and continues on across a wetland area where you may see some waterfowl. In the spring, look for blue penstemons blooming farther along. Stay on the main trail as it eventually narrows and heads downhill. About 0.7 mile from the trailhead it reaches the Green River at a point where the stream has divided to flow around an island.The northern branch in front of you may appear to be only creek-sized. On the other side, the trail does continue onto the island but there is no bridge. Wading the stream is not recommended and should be attempted, if at all, only when the water level is very low, the current very slow, and when you can use poles for balance. If there is any doubt, please turn around here.NOTE: If you hiked the park trails a few years ago, or are relying on an older edition of a hiking guide, you need to be aware of some changes and additions to the trail system.

Once this river trail could be followed all the way to Chancellor and then into the Pasayten Wilderness or towards Harts Pass. Alas, wash outs now close the trail five miles in at Mill Creek. This is a fabulous trail for families as the first few hundred yards are open forest which is well shaded and runs alongside the rocky Granite Creek. Soon after departing the trailhead, there is a large bridge to cross the river. After a few hundred yards, the trail bifurcates, the right branch taking the Chancellor Trail (Canyon Creek) and the left heading to Jackita Ridge and Crater Mountain. It is worth taking a small detour downt the left fork a short ways to the beautifully built Beebe Cabin. Originally built by three shipwrights it was moved to this location in the 30s and used as a guard station. Back at the intersection ascend the right hand fork. The trail quickly steps up the side of an old lateral moraine and then another a short distance beyond the first. Note the long even slope and imagine how it was formed by glaciers thousands of years ago. At the top of the moraine sits a fine camp site. Beyond this, the trails' grade eases and the noise of Highway 20 is drowned out by the river's crashing below. The trail’s gradual climb side-hills above Canyon Creek hundreds of feet below. Occasional old-growth trees dot the hillside, but mostly the needle-rich, soft duff trail just winds off into the distance.Trail runners will enjoy the gentle grade and almost complete lack of rocks.

Its sign is broken but as of this writing, the phrase “closed to horses” remains. Venture down this trail for a thrilling look into a hole but keep pets and children close by, a slip will be fatal.Continuing along, the hillside gets steeper and rock outcroppings are rounded. Watch for old blasting holes on the outside corners where rock was removed to create this old pack trail. Side creeks become more frequent and water is generally available at Discovery Creek about 2.5 miles from the trail head. The cool forest here is full of stair-step moss, twin flower, and many other fun plants. Lipstick lichen, also known as British Soldier lichen for its bright red caps is prolific along this trail. Boulder Creek is reached at around 3.5 miles after a descent of several hundred feet. Look for a great bench on the river's southern bank for camping.

Now the new Volcano View Trail offers hikers of every age a mile-long nature trail that curves around stumps, boulders and hemlocks.A thick green canopy of trees high above the trail shades hikers, keeping it considerably cooler on the hike, even when tempuratures soar in midsummer. The trail follows an old logging road, though it may be hard to tell. Trees have grown up over many sections of trail, and WTA volunteers worked hard to create a more natural experience for hikers as they built the trail over several years. From the trailhead, follow a gentle uphill grade to a flat section near some old-growth nurse logs. Kids will marvel at the western hemlock saplings that spring from the ancient stumps. This twist in the trail was intentional. WTA and land managers who laid out the trail wanted to show hikers a glimpse of the future; the saplings of today could be the magnificent trees of tomorrow. Past the nurse stumps, the trail traverses a hillside and passes over some mossy boulders. There's an open area here that can be used for picnicking, snacking, or simply a rest before continuing just a few minutes further to the south view of the volcano. Don't be surprised by the small parking lot nearby.

The first fire lookout here was established in 1916; a lowly tent perched on the peak until a cabin with a cupola was built in 1922. This was hit by lightning in 1927 and a second lookout was built, but it was subsequently destroyed in 1965 and never rebuilt. Remains of these structures can still be seen on the mountain, when you can tear yourself away from the view. But you'll have to earn the views on this hike. Even for conditioned hikers this is a physically demanding hike with almost 5,300 feet of elevation gain in a little over five miles. A scramble section with some exposed areas can be treacherous in snow or adverse weather conditions and intimidating to an unseasoned hiker. If you can safely navigate this trail though, the rewards are many.From the trailhead enjoy a pleasant hike through deep forest with several stream crossings. You'll gain a modest 1,300 feet to reach three and a half acre Lake Metan at 1.5 miles. Immediately you will see a ""T"" in the trail when reaching the lake. The trail to the right leads to several primitive camping opportunities while the trail to the left is the main trail. If you look up from the ""T"" you will see your destination high above your head. Lake Metan is the final water source on the trail, so be sure to refill here; you'll need it.From Lake Metan the grade steepens. Continue from the lake under the forest canopy as the trail switchbacks up the mountainside at a calf burning grade, eventually emerging at a boulder field in the basin below Stujack Pass, elevation 4,900 feet. This is a good spot for a break. Enjoy the view of Stujack Pass and listen for pikas squeaking in the boulder field.From the boulder field, continue to Stujack Pass, hiking on talus slopes and through wildflower meadows stocked with Indian paintbrush, aster, yellow monkey flower, lupine, and many more. During your hike in the basin the views open up to Sloan Peak and Three Fingers, and the Sauk River Valley below. Views improve all the way to the summit and sometimes mountain goats can be seen. Beware that the trail is starting to slough off at places here, so avoid taking shortcuts, which can worsen the erosion problem.From the saddle of Stujack Pass, elevation 5,750 feet, enjoy outstanding views. Many hikers will choose to end their hike here -- it's a good stopping point for hikers with pets or people with concerns about heights.If you choose to proceed, leave Stujack Pass and enter Glacier Peak Wilderness, indicated by a weathered sign. From here, the trail turns into a scramble route. Continue around the northeast side of the mountain on a path blasted out of cliffs and on heather slopes. Eventually you will reach the remains of a tram that was used to supply the fire lookout. From this point the trail is exposed and you will continue along a razorback ridge with a permanent snowfield. The White Chuck River Valley spread out below you on your left and the Sauk River Valley on your right. Continue along the knife edge and arrive at a cleft above the glacial trough. Use your hands to continue scrambling, passing an iron ring protruding out of the rock. Sometimes there will be cairns in this section showing the way. This part of the hike is considered a non-technical scramble, but in times of snow or adverse weather conditions it is best left to those with mountaineering experience. If you can negotiate this, the rest of the way is steep but easy to follow.When you finally reach the summit, relax and savor your well-earned achievement. Before you are glorious views in all directions, the most dramatic being Glacier Peak to the east of you.

It is quite steep at times and even includes a scramble or two. Steep sections remain snow-covered late into the season, and once it begins to melt out, snow bridges appear. Note also that depending on how far you wander once you arrive in the basin, your total mileage may vary from what is posted here. Your hike begins at the parking area in Barlow Pass with a one-mile road walk down a closed road that parallels the Sauk River. From the large parking lot, walk east along the highway for about 200 feet to a large “Road Closed” sign. Pass the sign and hike the closed road for one mile, looking for a trail heading off to the right and an outhouse, your last best bet for relief before the trail hits exposed talus fields that characterize the upper section of the trail.and into the woods.After turning off the road, it's an easy half-mile of forest rambling before Weeden Creek must be crossed. Take a moment to appreciate a scenic waterfall here--the trail begins climbing steadily as soon as you make the crossing. The business of ascending begins in earnest after Weeden Creek, with intermittent views and creek crossings. Several spots along this trail require light scrambling over frequently wet rocks.Take your time and enjoy the views, both micro and macro. The peaks of the Monte Cristo area loom off to your left. Some mining remnants remain, and crazy abundances of wildflowers choke the trail well into the end of July. Snow crossings also last until late in the season. As always, caution should be exercised as the trail can be blocked or made difficult to navigate by avalanche run-outs late into the season. Scrambling is necessary year-round in this section, so be sure you're comfortable with doing so before embarking on this adventure.Once in Gothic Basin, you'll be greeted first by Gothic Lake, gateway to this special place and deserving of much respect. Melting ponds, gurgling brooks, chirping marmots, and towering rock faces greet you in every direction. The temptation is to wander aimlessly. Instead, remember the Leave No Trace principles and confine your travels to durable surfaces such as rock and snow. If you’re looking for further wandering, head to Foggy Lake, off to the right as you follow periodic cairns and the most prominent footpath. Allow yourself extra time to find the path and to appreciate the natural beauty surrounding you. WTA Pro Tip: This is a popular area for camping. On a sunny weekend, start early to allow plenty of time to find a site. Note that Gothic Basin is an extremely fragile area, so be sure that you're camping on an established site or sturdy surface, like rock or dirt, and avoid camping in meadows or grasses, as this can damage the landscape. You’ll also want a bear can, as there are no trees in Gothic Basin suitable for a bear line."

Its sheer wall of a summit is very striking and easily instills visions of alpinism in those headed to Mount Forgotten Meadows, but the route takes a roundabout journey that requires not so much vertiginous daring-do as it does oodles of patience. The views from the top are spectacular, particularly the unobstructed view straight up Glacier Peak.Start out at the Perry Creek Trailhead and follow the Perry Creek Trail to its end (full description here: http://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/perry-creek). At the Mount Forgotten Meadows, head left to a spot where the high point above the tarns tapers down to the ridge. The biggest obstacle on the way to the top is here at the start, as the route drops over the edge. A short scramble without a lot of distinct holds (and very slippery when wet) ensues and descends to dirt and rock that is steep, but not quite steep enough to allow use of hands. After a hardscrabble loss of 200 feet in elevation, a rough, but distinct, trail emerges and traverses the southeast side of the mountain more or less in a straight, steadily ascending line. The next six tenths of a mile will feel mostly like a hike. Only in spots does the trail get truly informal and seem to dead end against the bark of a random tree. If you lose your way, stay on your most recent line, and chances are the trail will pick up again pretty much exactly where you would expect it to. After a long traverse and the occasional switchback, the trail reaches a broad shoulder on the east side of the peak looking out over the Sauk River drainage. The route now makes a hairpin turn, proceeding due west up a loose gully. After a short, steep climb over scree, the trail reaches solid ground again. From here, a surprisingly well groomed path proceeds through open slopes of heather. And then the trail abruptly ends in a few relatively short boulders that mark the summit. From this direction, Mount Forgotten is tame as a kitten. What happened to that airy summit? It hasn’t gone anywhere – the boulders of the summit mark the boundary between idyllic meadow and the sheer dropoff you may have gazed at longingly before deciding to march up here. A word to the wise if you pose for heroic mountaintop photos – remember where you are and watch your step! From this vantage, all the usual suspects (White Chuck, Pugh, Baker et al) dot the horizon, but Glacier Peak is the real star - there is nothing but open space between you and its volcanic slopes. WTA Pro Tip: While the route is mostly tame and well established, the trail beyond the meadows and tarns is unmaintained. Some routefinding may be required, as other climbers (and animals) have created spur trails and shortcuts in spots."

If you drew lines from the tops of Vesper and Sperry Peaks to a spot halfway between them, the resulting right angle would rest in the center of the lake. While there are few finer spots for a scenic lunch than on Vesper Lake’s shore, getting here is no picnic – it is reached by a rugged miners’ trail that will make you swear it gains more than its moderate 2,700 feet…or possibly just make you swear, as you scramble up the loose rock of Headlee Pass. The Sunrise Mine Trail #707 begins in second growth forest and almost immediately begins a quick series of creek crossings, first by way of a log bridge, then over a snaking tree root, and finally by whatever means available over the south fork of the Stillaguamish River. “River” here usually means “tame trickle,” but in times of heavy runoff, it can pose a serious obstacle. Improvised log bridges are strung up and washed away on a semi-annual basis. Check conditions; proceed accordingly. Beyond the Stillaguamish, the trail climbs steeply up a rocky hillside through dense vegetation, until rounding a bend to the left into the dramatic valley of Wirtz Basin, a deep slot anchored by the flanks of Morningstar Peak directly ahead and by the sheer walls of Sperry Peak to the right. Throughout the basin, pikas bark their warnings and scamper out of sight in jumbled talus. The trail heads more or less straight up valley, gently climbing at first through stunted firs. Emerging from the trees, the trail seems to peter out in a rock field. Cairns often mark the rough bootpath, but if you lose sight of them, just head straight towards the top of the valley until you find the trail again – look for an opening where it intersects with another stretch of trees. The trail switchbacks up the valley wall through large old growth before again seeming to head straight for the head of the basin. After a long straightaway over another open rock field, a hairpin turn to the right begins a series of ever tightening zigs and zags between the walls of a steep, narrow couloir. Watch for other hikers above -- the footing is loose, and rockfall is a real risk. The vertiginous climb peters out in a notch in the ridge, marked by a dead tree and an old weathered sign declaring: Headlee Pass 4,600 feet. The trail now drops a short way through trees on the other side of the pass before heading in a straight line across yet another talus slope. In a third of a mile, it meets the headwaters of Vesper Creek. The trail follows the right bank of the creek, around a bend, and up a short rise to the lake. Vesper is a relatively young lake. Older maps show it as a spot of ice, and the landscape seems to confirm that a glacier once squeezed itself into the rock here before melting away not all that long ago. The lake’s newness may also be why there’s still some debate about its name. Though most know it as “Vesper,” it is also often called “Lake Elan.” The lake is nearly encircled by an amphitheater of granite, and there isn’t a bad seat in the house. In one direction, admire the smooth rock of Vesper Peak and its wisp of a summit. In the other, crane your neck looking straight up at Sperry. Beyond the mouth of the lake, the interior Cascades stretch off into the distance in row after row of serrated ridges. As you depart, the surroundings offer up a final parting gift as Morningstar Peak is framed by the deep ‘V’ through which Vesper Creek exits the lake basin. From the correct angle, the peak is reflected in the creek’s surface where it flattens out between a jumble of bleached boulders.A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE AREAWhy is the trail called the Sunrise Mine Trail and not, say, the Vesper Lake trail? The folks who pounded a path into the landscape were after minerals, not mountains or lakes. Its original destination was a mining claim staked by a group of three miners led by Thomas E. Headlee, whose name still graces the rugged pass you cross on your way to and from the lake. Headlee, a lawyer by trade, would go on to be mayor of the city of Everett in the early 1900s. The Sunrise Mine fared much better than most nearby mining claims. A climbing party from The Mountaineers that wandered through here in 1918 reported it still in operation, long after nearby Monte Cristo had gone from boom to resolute bust. In fact, so promising was the Sunrise Mine that a Canadian company tried to get it going again in the 1970s, exploring every which way to reach the metals beneath Vesper Peak –- from the north, from the south, even underground through miles of rock if need be. The opening of one of their abandoned mine shafts –- now blocked off –- is visible to the keen-eyed in Wirtz Basin. Much of the area, including Vesper Lake, Sperry and a large portion of Vesper Peak, not only fall outside of protected wilderness, but also the boundaries of the National Forest. The area may always be in some sense an unrealized mining claim. Ironically, one of the main things that prevented its realization was the threat of lawsuit from the city once headed by Thomas Headlee himself, a city that owes its very existence to its role as the terminus of the rail line built to move the metals mined in Monte Cristo. When the plans to mine Vesper from the south were floated in the 70’s, Everett stepped in to protect its watershed in the Sultan Basin. For those who love the scenery for its own sake, it’s a relief that this place - developed by miners and unprotected by wilderness or park – is left by default to be the domain of hikers and climbers. Hard to say what Headlee – mayor, lawyer, prospector - would have thought of that; but as you return through Headlee Pass on your way out, you might give a nod to all three of his professions - first for uncovering and then for incidentally preserving, such a remarkable spot."

People who have taken the route to the top report feelings of sudden euphoria with minimal exposure and relatively painless routefinding.Follow the Sunrise Mine Trail #707 (described here: http://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/headlee-pass-and-vesper-lake) to the point where it intersects Vesper Creek. Rather than following the trail to the right towards Vesper Lake, cross the creek at its narrowest point. A rough, but well established trail proceeds straight up the opposite bank, quickly reaching a broader shoulder.For the next fifth of a mile, the trail meanders gently through heather and rock before steepening as it passes through a slope of low cedar and other subalpine evergreens. At times rocky and at others a slick muddy rut, the trail soon pops over a lip onto a flat spot below a rocky apron, briefly trailing along an exposed edge that offers views of Vesper Lake below. Soon the vegetation gives way to the smooth granite of Vesper's upper reaches. Here, the scramble begins. As off-trail scrambles go, this is one of the most straightforward, which makes it ideal for beginners. It is mostly low angle rock, making a major fall relatively unlikely. This isn't to say there is no risk. Falls of 10-20 feet are certainly possible in places, and it’s also possible to wander into parts of the mountain with greater exposure; but accidents and injuries here are rare. Exercise good judgment and stay within your abilities.Head in a straight line towards the highest point, more or less directly ahead when looking uphill. You want to follow a subtle rib - if you find yourself in a bit of a gully, you may have gone too far left. If you find yourself with air beneath your heels, you’ve wandered too far right. If you have to err to one side or the other, left is the better choice. As you climb through Vesper’s sea of granite, you will only occasionally and for short distances need to complement your feet with hands. Routefinding is a breeze - almost any line will do, and if things get impassable, a quick correction to either side usually presents itself. A steep snowfield often lingers just below the summit, but can be avoided by a quick jog to the left (to the right here is the most dangerous terrain on the east flank - steep rock with greater exposure requiring some technical moves to complete).If this is your first off-trail summit (and maybe even if it's your tenth or hundredth), the view from the top will have you feeling like the master of the mountains. Vesper sits in the middle of a lattice of intersecting ridges running between Del Campo Peak, Morningstar, Sperry and Big Four. Between Vesper and Big Four, the smooth ridge of scoured granite would look right at home another couple of thousand of feet higher in elevation. Northwest of the summit, the Vesper Glacier descends a deep chute to Copper Lake, tucked from view behind the rarely seen and surprisingly red, chossy backside of Big Four. Vesper Peak is definitely not for the novice hiker, but for those thirsting for one step beyond hiking into backcountry adventure, it's a good leaping off point. The potential consequences of stumbling here are decidedly lesser than they are on other summits along the Mountain Loop."

The route has numerous small ups and downs, meandering alongside the river. At the 4-mile mark is Red Creek, where a new bridge makes crossing a snap. During the time that there was no bridge this was a difficult ford, but now hikers can easily carry on to Mackinaw Shelter at 5.5 miles, where the North Fork Sauk River hike ends and climbing begins. Go as far as you like. This can be a short hike to the junction with the Pilot Ridge Trail, or up to 11 miles roundtrip to the shelter and back. WTA Pro Tip: If you can't have a hike without views, you can find them, even on this trail. Soon after leaving the trailhead, come to a junction with the Red Mountain Trail. Turning onto this trail, hike one mile. You'll gain 700 feet of elevation before you arrive at the site of the old Red Mountain Lookout. This is not the top of the mountain but a good viewpoint nonetheless. The lookout site and the first few miles of the North Fork Sauk Trail makes for a good day, allowing for both forest exploration and heart pumping elevation gain."

This point housed a lookout tower from 1935 until 1964 when, ironically, it burned down.   Because the surrounding forest had burned in the 1905 fire, the Barlow Point fire lookout had unobstructed views in all directions.

It’s a fine mountain in its own right too; you’ll ascend nearly 4,000 feet on your way to the top. This is a three-season trail. In late fall, before snow closes the Mountain Loop Highway short of the trailhead, it makes a spectacular snowshoe route. In late spring and early summer, it is the quintessential view hike. And in late summer and early fall, it offers a treasure trove of plump blueberries. Start out at the parking lot Dickerman shares with the Perry Creek trailhead. Large as the parking lot may be, it fills to capacity and beyond on sunny weekends. For the first two or so miles, the trail switchbacks through dense forest. The first part of the trail is enlivened by the occasional rocky outcropping and a spot or two where fallen trees practically form a roof over the trail. After those first two miles, breaks in the forest canopy begin offering up tantalizing views of nearby peaks, like Big Four and Vesper. In another two thirds of a mile, the trail breaks out into the open for a brief series of quick switchbacks before it dives north and heads into a mostly flat section. With the exception of a few zig zags, the trail heads almost straight ahead as it traverses a broad shoulder from the southeast flanks of the mountain to the peak’s west ridge. Unless it hasn’t rained in a very long time, the flat terrain and exposed terrain combine with spring runoff to make for a muddy half of a mile. The trail hits the ridge and stays at or near it for a while. Where it intersects the ridge, be sure to stop and enjoy the views to the north. Particularly striking is the view up the ridge to the cliffs of Dickerman’s summit, hanging high above the Perry Creek drainage. After a third of a mile, the trail heads east, away from the ridge and out into the open, south-facing slopes below the summit. Here, fields of blueberries bask in the sun, making it one of the first places in the Cascades where this scarce crop fully ripens. The trail resorts once again to switchbacks on its steady climb through the meadows, with a brief pause for a side trail to a vantage point with direct views of the summits of Gothic Basin and Monte Cristo. In another third of a mile, you reach the summit ridge. Several groves of trees force a bit of a choice here: stay below the summit and gaze south or stand on the very top and gaze north. There is no bad decision, since views to either direction are spectacular. The summit drops away sharply to the north into the adjacent valleys between Stillaguamish Peak, Mount Forgotten and Twin Peaks. The occasional mountain goat may play peekaboo from the rocky ledges below the summit, but be careful when playing along; the north side of the summit is nothing but a sheer dropoff. Looking back to the west and north, you can scan through all the major peaks of the northern Mountain Loop: Three Fingers, Whitehorse, White Chuck, Pugh and Sloan, while Baker, Shuksan and Glacier Peak hover above and seemingly just beyond. On your way down, the visual trek continues through Monte Cristo, Del Campo, Morningstar, Sperry, Vesper, Big Four, and Pilchuck. With the possible exception of Hidden Lake Lookout, this is the finest summit view around--a rare chance to get so close to so many other summits at the same time. Mount Dickerman may have asked a lot of you to get here, but it will have more than held up its end of the bargain."

Located in the Mount Baker Wilderness, the trail traverses the south-facing slopes of the High Divide. As you climb, you are treated to spectacular wildflowers shows in spring and early summer. Come autumn, the hillsides are vivid in orange, reds and yellows. This is a breathtaking area at any time of year, and so understandably popular. Expect plenty of company on trail and arrive early if you plan on camping. From the trailhead, the trail begins and immediate ascent. You will share the trail with hikers bound for Tomyhoi Lake on this steep ascent, which gains nearly 1500 feet of elevation in just under a mile and a half. As the trail climbs, you switchback through an avalanche path (meaning this is a trail best done when snow-free) and enter a forest before popping out into a meadow. Fortunately, along the way various flora keep you occupied. Try and identify the trees in the woods as you trek along, and in the meadow, look for Indian paintbrush, lupine, heather and fireweed, among others. Bringing a field guide is a good idea; with it, you can take breaks and identify interesting trailside trees and blooms. For the more geologically inclined, rock formations carved out as the Puget Lobe retreated north provide equally fascinating distraction. And for photo buffs, there are of course the stunning views of  Mounts Baker and Larrabee, the western section of the High Divide, and, in Canada, the Border Peaks.Soon you reach the junction for Yellow Aster Butte – a mile and a half from the trailhead. Your destination is to the left. Heading right follows a trail to Tomyhoi Lake, another 2.5 miles away. The trail to Yellow Aster Butte flattens out some on this next section, as you traverse around the south flank of the mountain. You can breathe easy and take in the views all around you for a little more than two miles, until reaching an unsigned junction 3.6 miles from the trailhead.Backpackers may want to ditch heavy packs at camp. If so, head left. This trail descends on narrow, steep switchbacks to the camping area. Day hikers will want to head right, to the summit of Yellow Aster Butte. From here, the views are stunning, with Baker, Shuksan, Tomyhoi, and many other jagged, snow-covered peaks lining your horizon. WTA Pro Tip: Due to its popularity, the camping area is likely to be full by midday. Please only camp on snow, rock, or bare ground – the meadows here are as fragile as they are beautiful, and even a short overnight stay can seriously damage them."

The remains were estimated to be more than 10,000 years old, but when the Army Corps of Engineers finished construction of the Lower Monumental Dam on the Snake River, the site was inundated, despite a large berm that was built to protect the site. Today, a faint and narrow trail leads to the pond, which is stocked with trout by the Lyons Ferry Fish Hatchery. Visible on sunny days as you hike, they float near the surface, occasionally breaking through to snap at a gnat or fly. Bring your pole, that’s for sure. From the parking area, head north, up and over a small hillock featuring a picnic table and a dog play area. Pass two bathrooms that may be closed (the park’s facilities are in the direction opposite to the one that you’re walking). Continue on to a large kiosk and another small parking area. You may wonder why you didn’t just park here. There’s far less room at this lot, and the nearby locked gate indicates that the road behind it is for staff use only. Stick to the parking area near the water. Take a look at the kiosk at this lot before you leave. A large map shows you the land ownership of this area and you’ll also see your trail, a little dotted black line that takes off half a mile up the paved road. Note that most of your hike takes place on land established as the Lyons Ferry Habitat Management Unit. Hunting is allowed here, so be aware and wear your orange.The trail roughly follows the maintenance road, owned by WSDOT. Parallel the road first, just east of a railroad track. If you’re lucky enough to have one come through as you hike, you’ll have a great photo opportunity of it as it crosses the trestle bridge behind you.  A mile and a half from the kiosk, the trail begins looping east, around a large rocky outcropping. The rocks in this outcropping soar feet hundreds of feet above you – it’s impressive from any angle. Enjoy it as you come around to the east side. From here, the trail beings to wend between many other smaller outcroppings in classically spectacular Channeled Scablands topography. Keep an eye out here for wildflowers and rattlesnakes. In summer, these cleverly camouflaged reptiles enjoy sunning themselves on the trail and in the brush to either side.Other wildlife call this area their home. Listen for kestrels and crows, and underfoot, keep an eye out for scorpions and porcupines as you make your way along the trail.It’s two miles to Marmes Pond, where you’ll be able to sit and take a rest in the warm sun, maybe even cast a line. Be considerate of other anglers, though, and refrain from swimming here. Views are gorgeous, where the bluffs of the scablands meet the rolling hills of the Palouse. Looking downriver, you may see a very faint path beneath the east side of the high bluffs and outcrops you passed on your way in. This is a narrow, overgrown bootpath that does offer an alternate way to return to your car, but it can be precarious in spots, and a missed step could mean a long fall."

The trail is very narrow and the hillside is steep. Be aware of where you step to share the trail with fellow hikers. Climb steadily through balsamroot and lupine, as well as bluebells, phlox, and a myriad other wildflowers, depending on when you visit in the season. As you ascend, look for the east edge of the Stuart Range to come into view, until you come to a fork in the trail at half-mile point. The left fork offers excellent views of the Wenatchee River Valley and the peaks surrounding you. Icicle Ridge looms in front of you, and views of the Enchantments are stunning. The right fork offers straight path through shady forest to the summit. Take either fork, as the trail reconnects later on at one-mile point, just before the viewpoint. The trail is marked at half-mile points, allowing you to keep track of your distance. Eventually cross into National Forest Land and an old logging road. There are notices here indictaing a logging operation. Continue through forest until reaching the summit of Sauer Mountain, where hikers will find good views of the surrounding peaks, and a helpful wooden sign that indicates Rock, Clark, Glacier Peak, and many other summits.Not tired yet? Don't worry -- the Sauer Mountain sign and summit register is not the end of the trail.

There are trails aplenty at Palouse Falls State Park with outstanding views of the waterfall fit for the whole family.At the end of the last ice age, repeated glacial floods, known as the Missoula Floods, swept across eastern Washington carving out the unique scablands landscape we see today. Among the coulees, potholes, buttes, and plateaus, Palouse Falls remains as one of the magnificent and lasting remnants of these glacial floods. It is the only major waterfall left along this thousands of years old glacial flood path, and as of February 12, 2014, is Washington's official state waterfall. Standing at a height of 198 feet and surrounded by striking basalt cliffs, the powerful waterfall lies on the Palouse River upstream of the confluence with the Snake River. Formerly known as Aput Aput, meaning “Falling Water,” so named by the Palouse Indians, Palouse Falls is located within Palouse Falls State Park. The park boasts a 105-acre camping area with 11 tent spaces, including one campsite that is ADA compliant. All sites are available on a first come, first served basis. You will also find other amenities including sheltered and unsheltered picnic tables, information kiosks, pit toilet restrooms, and wheelchair accessible paths. All visitors should be aware that this area is home to rattlesnakes, so be careful where you walk. You may also encounter the infamous yellow-bellied marmot during your visit. Many reside in the park and can be found grazing throughout the area. From the trailhead, continue for 1/3 of a mile until the gravel path comes to an end. Keep an eye out for wildflowers that add splashes of color to the landscape. You will see a dirt path ahead that descends into the canyon; this is a user-created social trail that the State Park encourages hikers NOT use.Signs indicate where this trail starts. It is quite steep and riddled with loose rocks making for a potentially hazardous descent. In late 2015, due to misuse of these trails and many injured hikers, the park closed the bootpaths leading to the base of the falls, reopening them with warnings about hiker safety.WTA Pro Tip: Time your visit to the falls with the sunset. Watching the light and shadows change along the canyon walls is an experience not to be missed. This time of day also offers the opportunity to take advantage of the optimal golden hour lighting that so many photographers seek."

Great views of the bridge over Deception and Canoe Pass, calm Lottie Bay, a woodland walk through hemlock, fir and Pacific Madrone, plus the legend of the Maiden of Deception Pass are what await you here.Begin your journey by walking out on the fishing pier to see what people are catching and snap a few pictures of the seagulls hanging around hoping for a handout. Unless you have a line in the water, walk back and head south along the shore of Bowman Bay to the trail to Lottie and Lighthouse Point. Pick up the trail as it crosses over a marshy area and up a small steep rocky cliff.  Drop down to sea level and come to a signed intersection. Left takes you up to Highway 20 and Pass Lake, but you'll hang a right and shortly come to another intersection. Head left here and follow the trail around Lottie Point. Take this trail for views of Deception and Canoe Pass and the impressive bridge above. Admire also the beautiful red peeling bark and twisted trunks of the Pacific Madrone trees along the cliffs. This striking native broadleaf evergreen has clusters of tiny white flowers in the spring and showy orangey red berries in the fall. It prefers a sunny dry and rocky site and grows along the rugged coastal cliffs of Puget Sound. Once you have done this short half-mile loop, meet the trail to Lighthouse Point at the intersection again. The trail to Lighthouse Point crosses a very narrow sliver of grassy beach. Here you may want to dig out your binoculars and check out whatever ducks may be on the calm waters of Lottie Bay. The trail forks by a large hollowed-out, burned tree. Take the left fork for a nice mile-long loop around the point.  Surprisingly, for such as small area, there are some nice old Douglas firs here. Walk through the woods a short way and come to more views of the bridge and across to Whidbey Island and North Beach. At one point you will be able to drop down to the beach and climb up a large grassy rock outcropping. Look for the geological survey marker, marking it as Lighthouse Point, elevation just about 22 feet. Feel winded? Pull out those binoculars and watch for harbor seals that like to swim offshore. When you've got your breath back, continue on to Vista Point. Here the trail fades off into a bunch of little paths through the salal and Oregon grape, go back and catch the obvious trail for the loop, or explore a little and head back to the main trail when ready. Once back at the fishing pier, continue past the parking lot, through the picnic area and past the CCC Interpretive center and you will find the trail to your last destination, Rosario Beach. Start off with a short, steep little climb, then level off as you head above the bay. There are plenty of paths leading to scenic overlooks. Notice Gull Rocks just offshore; they should be named Cormorant Corners, since there seem to be more cormorants than seagulls!  Reach Rosario Beach picnic area in a half-mile. If you hike this in winter, no that the park here will be officially closed, and the restrooms will be locked. There are picnic tables along the narrow stretch of land between the parking lot and Rosario Head. Here you will find a large pole carving of Kwuh-kwal-uhl-wut, the Maiden of Deception Pass. A legend of the Coast Salish people, take the time to read her story on plaques which circle the pole, along with some facts about the Native people that called this place home. Take the loop trail around Rosario Head, but be careful of the steep drop off along the cliffs. Keep children and dogs away from the edges. Here there are more expansive views out across the Sound to the Olympics. If you are camping nearby, remember this place for some sunset photography or a little romantic picnic. Once you have completed the circle, head back the way you came with a full pack of scenery.WTA Pro Tip: To extend your hike, hike to Pass Lake, then walk along the highway and across the bridge for hikes up Goose Rock or down to the North Beach."

The trail can accommodate a range of hiking interests, from short day hikes to overnight backpacking excursions. And thanks to the trail’s low elevation, it is accessible even when most other Cascadian trails are buried under snow.The trail flanks the eastern edge of Baker Lake, created by the 1959 damming of the Baker River. Starting from either the north or south trailhead, hikers will encounter a forest of maturing Douglas firs. Cedar used to dominate, but the 1843 eruption of Mount Baker triggered a forest fire, reducing the old-growth cedars to burnt snags.Cedar remains among the towering firs provide evidence of this historical event. Along the trail, foliage, fungus, lichen and moss never fail to impress. Mushrooms dot the forest floor allowing hikers to forage for fabulous fungus as they traipse through the woods, and the towering trees draped with old man’s beard provide shelter from the drizzly mist that accompanies most winter hikes in the Northwest.Numerous cascading creeks cross the trail as they make their way from the mountains above to the lake water below. Sturdy bridges span these tributaries keeping your feet dry and your brain pondering how a trail crew could build such a strong structure in the wilderness. Most impressive of all is the suspension bridge over the rushing Baker River, just a half-mile from the northern trailhead. (To hike this trail from the northern trailhead, see the East Bank Baker Lake entry from Craig Romano's Day Hiking the North Cascades http://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/baker-lake).

It’s a well maintained trail that meanders beneath a thick canopy of maple, alder, and cedar trees and between a dense understory of salmonberry, ferns, and numerous wildflower species in the spring.The popular trailhead is located in the Cougar Mountain Regional Wildlife Park. There is a veritable maze of trails and trailheads here so it is helpful to bring along a map of the area. Cougar Mountain was extremely busy with coal mining from 1863-1963. The miners tunneled six miles under the mountain and strip mined the surface, eventually hauling out 11 million tons of bituminous coal. Remnants of the mining past are obvious when you see the large holes in the ground alongside the trail. These “cave holes” were formed when miner’s underground extractions got too close to the surface, which eventually led to cave-ins. Be sure to stay on the trail so as to avoid the deeper and potentially dangerous cave holes. One of the larger holes in the area is rumored to go 518 feet below sea level.The forest endured logging in the past and there are some pretty remarkably large stumps left behind to remind you of what was once there. There is a fair amount of stinging nettle edging the trail, so be sure to stay on the marked route!From the trailhead veer left following the Red Town Trail. The trail starts off very wide.  At the first trail junction, 0.1 miles in, veer left, joining the Cave Hole Trail. The trail gets a bit narrower here but it is still wide enough for vehicles. After 0.2 miles along the Cave Hole Trail, you will encounter another trail junction, continue along the Cave Hole Trail for an additional 0.4 miles where you will reach your third trail junction. Here, veer to the right to begin along the Coal Creek Falls Trail. The trail becomes much more narrow here. This trail used to be notorious for its muddy conditions but thanks to a reroute completed by WTA in 2014 your shoes should stay relatively clean.  As the trail begins to descend you should hear the sound of running water from nearby Coal Creek. After a short set of stairs going down it’s just 0.3 miles further and you reach Coal Creek Falls! This 28 foot waterfall is fueled by runoff and has its best flows in the rainy, winter months. The falls do run dry during the summer months, usually mid June to whenever the rainy season starts up again in the winter.There is a large parking lot at the trailhead, but it’s heavily used and fills up quickly. The trailhead is equipped with two privies, garbage cans, a picnic table, historical interpretive signage, and doggie bag dispenser."

The 25-foot falls are the final waterfall along Cherry Creek. The falls drop over a wide, rocky ledge into a large pool. This pool is inviting to hikers, but as always with waterfalls, be careful when splashing and playing in rocky areas. Cherry Creek flows well all year long, but by autumn the left-hand side of the falls usually dries up.To find the unmarked trail head entrance, look directly behind the road sign marking the junction of Kelly Road and Moutain View Road. This is the unmarked trailhead entrance, near a locked blue gate. Note that parking is limited to the shoulder of Mountain View Road only, there is no trail access near road signs marked Private or No Parking. From where you park, follow the road-turned-trail behind the gate and the corresponding junctions as follows. At three-quarters of a mile you’ll cross Margaret Creek on a bridge. Shortly after that, stay left at the first junction and right at the second, ignoring any grassy overgrown roads.After climbing a short hill, stay right at the third junction and proceed downhill. At 1.5 miles, the road makes a sharp hairpin to the right. Head left on a muddy track through the woods. Stay left at next junction to then rejoin the overgrown road. Taking a right at this junction leads you past a crashed car in the trees. Stay straight for another mile, hopping across a few creeks then arrive at Hannan Creek, a large washout that has been leveled by machinery. Ford the creek--walking sticks left by other hikers can be of assistance here. The trail to the falls branches off to the right on the other side of Hannan Creek. It may be hidden from view by a large dirt pile. Follow the sound of the falls, and shortly a firepit area is reached, which overlooks the falls. There is a short path leading to the base of the falls, a total of two and a half miles from the trailhead."

Accessible year-round, this is an all-weather, year-round hike, though it's worth noting that the area is open to hunting during the season. Climb 800 feet in about two and a quarter miles, being aware of the low spots that can get muddy in the winter, despite the boardwalks through these areas.  Most of the hike is through forest and a previously logged out area that offers a nice view. With several sections of step-ups, the trail is a good workout, and though it crosses a couple access roads throughout Pack Forest, it is well-marked and easy to follow.At the top, end in a small meadow with a couple of benches and a trail register.

Sheep Lake is nestled in a subalpine area that explodes with wildflowers in July and August. The lake is a good place to relax and enjoy nature or perhaps take off your boots and go wading. Sourdough Gap is a small saddle in a rocky-edged ridge. The hike from the lake to the gap offers increasingly picturesque views of the south Cascades with every foot of altitude you gain. Once at the gap, you will be rewarded with grand views of Sheep Lake on one side and the Chrystal Lakes basin on the other side.The hike to Sheep Lake is a 2.1 mile gentle climb on a good trail. The first mile traverses a steep slope above Highway 410. The hillside is decorated with wildflowers in the summer and red huckleberry plants in the fall. Although the trail dips in and out pockets of trees, the views are quite good, and you can get a bird’s eye view of the deep valley of the Rainier fork of the American River. You will also be treated to glimpses of Mount Rainier and Naches Peak.After the traverse, the trail turns north, leaving the highway and the road sounds behind. The trail enters a forested area interspersed with small meadows, and eventually enters an alpine setting and climbs a bit more to Sheep Lake. Sheep Lake is a green gem that pops into view as you near it. You may hear the happy sounds of children playing in the water or see hikers lazing on the rock outcropping where the trail comes to the lake. This outcropping is the perfect place to take a break, while the nearby beach may tempt you to take off your boots and go wading. The hike in to Sheep Lake is good, but the 1.4 mile hike up to Sourdough Gap is even better. The trail wraps around the lake and then begins a steeper climb along the valley wall up to the gap. The scenery becomes more beautiful as you gain elevation. You can look down on the basin containing Sheep Lake. On a clear day you can see the surrounding South Cascades, including Mount Adams and Mount St. Helens. Once at Sourdough Gap, the scenery is postcard beautiful with Sheep Lake and Mount Adams to the south and Placer Lake and Norse Peak to the north. You can also observe the Pacific Crest Trail as it continues north on the hillside above the Crystal Lakes basin. After enjoying the views, retrace your steps to return to your car."

With an elevation gain of 1806 feet in the first two miles, and another 372 feet in the next mile, this trail is perfect if you're in training. Balsamroot decorate the hillsides as you proceed up up up, but soon the relatively clear trail turns into a route-find through downed trees, felled from beetle kill and old burns. Expect to scramble over more than a few blowdowns on your way to the top. The Rattlesnake Ridge trailhead is just off the Tucannon River Road, two miles past the Tucannon Guard Station. There’s no parking area as such, so your best bet is to have a Discover Pass to park in the Camp Wooten lot opposite the trailhead. Another option would be to stay at the Panjab campground, just 200 yards further down the road. In fact, the trail departs from the campground, so it’ll be right in your backyard. Begin by fording the Tucannon River, which rushes by the campground. The most well-established path to the water leads to a flat spot where the river passes over a small underwater berm of rocks. It’s 3 to 4 feet deep in high water, and 15 feet to the other side of the water here. The rocks underfoot are slippery. Keep this in mind when fording. If you’d rather not start the hike wet, you can brushbash upstream to a tangle of trees that, with a little acrobatics, you can cross without too much trouble. The trick here is getting back downstream to that ford. Watch your footing – a small user trail has been established but parts of it are very close to the water. Once you’ve arrived at the other side of the ford, the fun really begins. Immediately begin climbing steeply up the hillside, switchbacking through huge ponderosa pines, and whippy willows. WTA crews cleared the first mile of this trail in 2016 – this first part gives you a glimpse of what the trail could be like compared with the rest of the trail, which is slumping at best, at worst, it's hard to find due to blowdowns. The trail curves to the west side of the ridge, where balsamroot bask in the sun on the hillside. Keep climbing, and look also for lupine, paintbrush, desert parsley, and bitterroot as you go. Cross back to the east side of the ridgeline about a mile and a half from the trailhead, at your first peak -- 4776 feet. Here the trail becomes fainter, and many downed trees slow your pace. But you’re chugging upwards, and a pause now and then to figure out how to get around these knotted trees might be welcome. Skirt another outcropping masquerading as your second high point. Now begins your first traverse – just below the top of a ridgeline looking southeast. The trail here is narrow and crowded with brush. Watch your footing. After a bit of a breather, you’ll resume climbing, but this time a little more gently, to a broad open meadow, the intro to the second high point at 5748 feet. Skirt a small island of trees that shelters the high point, and follow the trail as it passes west to a point where it abruptly turns northeast and begins descending into a saddle. During this section, you may hear Alnus Spring burbling away, though it is out of sight, downhill from the trail. The saddle is an old burn area with other trees struck by beetle blight – lots of them are down and climbing over them takes some time. From the lowest point in the saddle, the trail begins to climb slightly as you follow a drainage (this is actually the trail, but water taking the path of a least resistance over the years has gutted it). Just as the brush and tree remnants seem to completely overwhelm the trail, pop out into yet another large meadow, and turn right. Trees are down (surprise) across the trail, but it just follows the forest border. Do the same, and soon see the trail turn away from the woods into the meadow. Join up with the trail and gradually hike uphill, past Red Fir Spring. Past the spring, parkland opens up and glades of forest dot the landscape which is primarily wide open meadows full of Jacob’s shooting star, glacier lilies, and myriad other vibrant wildflower. Snow stays here for much longer, so the trail may be wet as the water runs off. But the traverse is gorgeous, with beautiful wildflowers and views of the Blue Mountains beyond. Rattlesnake Ridge trail terminates about five miles from the trailhead, at an intersection in a meadow known as Indian Corrall. Taking a sharp right puts you on the 5.6 mille Panjab trail, which you can do in conjunction with Rattlesnake for a semi-loop (it requires a three mile road walk back to the Rattlesnake trailhead. Continuing straight on at this junction is the Misery Ridge Trail, and a slight right leads to the Crooked Creek trail. If you're just hiking for the day, turn around here or continue down the Panjab Trail. If you're continuing on, best of luck in your further adventures!"

From the parking area, follow the trail as it winds through fields of balsamroot and cheatgrass, gradually leading to the rim of the canyon about a half mile from the trailhead. Here you can peer down into Yakima Canyon without risking vertigo -- the ground falls away in a staircase pattern so it's not a sheer drop. Despite that, keep children close at hand here. Continuing onwards and upwards, note the gorgeous expanse of wildflowers all around you. Look for purple bitterroot, purple larkspur, white and pink buckwheat, even fluffy big-headed clover early in the season. Keep an eye out for wildlife as well. Bighorn sheep live in the canyon, and pelicans like the Yakima River Canyon. You may be lucky enough to spot a few soaring on the breezes as they come out of the canyon. The trail proceeds uphill for another mile, following the fenceposts. Then it turns away from the rim of the canyon briefly, allowing you a respite from climbing as you traverse through ever-thicker wildflowers. But soon it turns back toward the canyon rim, and you'll enjoy the rest of the hike to an old hitching post at the high point. It's two miles to this hitching post. The view here is gorgeous, and it's a great place to stop for the day. But, you can proceed even further on if you wish. Dropping into the saddle offers even better views of Roza and the dam that provides irrigation to some of the Yakima Valley. It's nearly 6 miles roundtrip if you continue on to the saddle. Or go big. Head for the high summit visible from the hitching post. Locally known as Gracie Point, it adds another two miles to your hike and a fair bit of elevation gain, but views from the top, on a clear day, are incredible."

This route offers all the beauty and majesty found in the wintry mountains without the stren¬uous workout usually required to see such splendor. It is perfect for taking the family on a gentle snowshoe stroll or for introducing newbies to the joys of snowshoeing. The trail is wide - actually, most of the ""trail"" is on a section of the unplowed Mountain Loop Highway - and flat, so first-timers can get the feel for walking on snowshoes without having to worry about climbing, crossing, or descending steep slopes. But despite its mild nature, this trail accesses some truly wild country. Trekking up to the base of Big Four Mountain, snowshoers can gawk in awe at the towering peak before them. The granite monolith of Big Four, with its long icicle fingers and snowy cap, captivates most visitors, but it's not the only natural wonder found here. Huge ancient trees, a clear, ice-rimmed river, and hordes of animals--big and small--are here to enjoy as well.Leave the parking area and trek up the snowbound Mountain Loop Highway as it follows the Stillaguamish River upstream. The road is lined with towering cedar and fir trees--many of which sport long, flowing beards of green. At 0.5 mile, cross the sparkling waters of Coal Creek as it rushes in from the north to empty into the Stillaguamish. Follow the road more than 2 miles until a small side road veers away to the right. This is the entrance to the Big Four Picnic Area and the trailhead for the Big Four Ice Caves Trail. The ice caves themselves are typically blocked by early December--heavy snowfall and continual avalanches keep the caves capped tight throughout the winter--but the 1-mile trail from the picnic area is worth exploring. The trail leads to the base of Big Four and, along the way, offers outstanding views of the giant rock face of the mountain. Though it may be tempting to snowshoe right up to the jumbled pile of snow at the mouth of the ice caves, resist that temptation. That pile of snowballs is what remains of the devastating avalanches that flash down the side of the mountain after every snowstorm and after most sunny mornings. The bright sun on the rock face weakens the snow and ice, sending it crashing down on the trail below with absolutely no warning.Author’s Rating: Easiest. Generally good trails for beginners, with little elevation change and minimal avalanche danger."

Sadly, it is a town that brought about its own demise by eventually eliminating its sole reason for being. In 1900 Thomas and Russell Bordeaux, two owners of the Mason Logging Company, established the town of Bordeaux for their employees. By 1903 the population of the town had grown to several hundred people. The town had a post office, saw mill, shingle mill, hotel, many houses, a school, and at least one general store. For the majority of the town’s history, oxen and machines, called donkey engines, dragged felled trees to the railroad lines to be transported to the town for milling. The resulting lumber and shingles were then shipped via railroad to market. Many of the current roads in the area are built upon the old railroad beds.As logging activity continued around Bordeaux and profitable trees got farther from the town site, portable workers’ bunkhouses were built on the railways and used to move loggers to the trees. Eventually the timber ran out, and the Bordeaux mill was closed in 1941. Families abandoned the town to seek opportunity elsewhere.The Bordeaux town site sits on Mima Creek south of Olympia. You will park alongside the road to access the site. Among the trees just north of the road you will see an old concrete bank vault that used to be part of a hotel. The vault was used to hold the wages for the loggers and other company workers that lived in town. On the south side of they road you can walk into the tall grass and cross the creek on a narrow wooden bridge to get into town. You will find the remnants of several brick structures on the south side of the creek that are now mostly buried by dead leaves and forest debris.

You decide.Start out from the trailhead on a wide trail that meanders through forest, with trees young and old. Due to its popularity, this part of the trail has been the focus of numerous trail maintenance outings, yet there are still rocks and roots to contend with; that’s just the nature of the terrain.At a half mile, freeway noise peaks as you pass under the elevated span of eastbound Interstate 90. Then at just over 1 mile is a popular natural feature known by various names: the Denny Creek Water Slide, Slide Rock, the Slippery Slab. This is the destination for many families, for frolicking and/or picnicking on a hot summer day. If this is your destination, see our hiking guide entry for Denny Creek.At the water slide, Denny Creek is posted as “Impassible During High Water”. In normal flows however, strategically placed rocks offer a dry crossing. The trail re-enters pleasant forest on the opposite side, marked by a sign on a large tree that reads “Main Trail”. A quarter mile from the water slide, the trail passes through an area of lush vegetation then breaks out into the open, revealing two tiers of Keekwulee Falls, the main drop falling 90 feet into a steep ravine.  In the morning, the falls can be seen glinting in the sunlight.Climb more earnestly after this point, alternating between open talus and forested shade. At 1.9 miles, hear Denny Creek echoing off the walls of its narrow gorge above Keekwulee Falls, finally drowning out freeway noise. At a couple of switchbacks, the trail offers views almost straight down for those who may want to peer down the steep walls.At 2.25 miles, the trail levels off for 0.2 mile until it crosses gently gurgling Denny Creek on a footlog beside a huge cedar snag. The rest of the way to Hemlock Pass is steep as you alternate between talus and forest. In season, there may be few wildflowers blooming in this section. At 3.8 miles, top out at Hemlock Pass, 4600 feet. Continue the final 0.4 mile, losing 150 feet of elevation to arrive at the outlet of Melakwa Lake. A massive logjam offers one way to cross the outlet stream. Just on the other side is a popular gathering place for hikers and a signed trail to a privy. Enjoy the lake and wonder at the meaning of its name. Hint: “Melakwa” is Chinook for “mosquito”.To get to the smaller Upper Melakwa Lake, continue 0.2 mile along the left side of the lake.

It is a nice off season walk though, and is perfect on a crisp, clear winter day. With the leaves off the trees, views that aren't possible in summer emerge; the surrounding peaks and the mossy green silhouettes of the leafless maple trees cover the hillside. A bonus any time of year are the many creeks, quaint bridges, large old-growth trees and of course, Mount Baker as the main attraction. The hike starts alongside the Baker River on a wide dirt path. Look ahead for a long suspension bridge over the river on your right. In a half mile the trail splits. Straight ahead is the trail up the river; a worthy river wander for another day. Take the right trail and have fun crossing the suspension bridge. The child in all of us should get a little thrill as the bridge bounces with our steps! If the weather is cooperating, you will be able to see some of the nearby snow-capped peaks. Once across, the path heads over an old river channel and crosses Blum creek on the first of many wooden bridges. Climb a little as your path takes you between mossy boulders. Look for spaces in between them, and ponder what small creature would make the caves a winter home. Cross another wooden bridge, and you see the river spreading out. Switchback up a short steep section and you will come to Hidden Creek. Just before crossing, there is a very large, recently downed tree. From the jagged stump, with your eyes follow the trunk downhill, you can see it broken in several places. Ponder for a minute, the power of nature that brought such a giant down. Hidden Creek is anything but hidden. It is a noisy and wide creek, the white water splashing among the mossy rocks and fallen branches. Here is another cool bridge! This one, built with a long zig zag shape,is also fun to cross, although it must have presented a challenge for the trail crews that engineered it. As you hike above the shoreline, the tip of Mount Baker should come into view above the hillside across the lake. Actually Baker Lake is a reservoir, made when the river was dammed, not the prettiest of lakes when the water is drawn down. In the summer, it is popular with boaters, fishermen, and swimmers. Look instead as you hike along the trail, at the beautiful woods, with the green moss hanging off the maple trees and the old man’s beard hanging from the fir and hemlock. Enjoy the little streams and more wooden bridges. Remember the newly downed tree seen earlier? Compare that to the old mossy stumps, growing shelf fungus on their sides, the fallen trunks now nurse logs for growing hemlock seedlings. There are some big trees on this trail. Give them a hug, and wonder what it will take to knock them over and start a new cycle. In the spring, look for yellow violets and trillium here also. Come to a wide, unbridged stream, it is shallow and easily crossed on a few well placed rocks. You will see more of Baker, both mountain and lake. It may be tempting here to make your way down to the shore for lunch. Hold off, a better spot awaits you on the other side of the small peninsula you can now see. Head through a small clearing in the trees, here are salmonberry plants growing, and when the magenta flowers open, you may find yourself nose to beak with a Rufus hummingbird.  Come to a signed intersection at 4.2 miles. The Baker Lake trail continues straight ahead and crosses Noisy Creek. The left fork heads up alongside Noisy Creek and the right fork leads to Noisy Creek campground. A good place for lunch, there are picnic tables, fire pits and tent sites, plus a backcountry toilet and a metal bear box. Stroll down to the beach for some great views of Mount Baker and maybe the tip of Mount Shuksan. Once lunch is eaten, take the trail up Noisy Creek. You don’t have to go far to see ‘Big Doug.’ This tree has got to be one of the biggest Douglas firs in the Cascades! You will recognize it by the huge gnarled old trunk. Turn around when you are ready to head back to your car, or continue along the main trail as far as you are able to go in a day. WTA Pro Tip: This trail continues all the way along the east side of the lake, 14.5 miles one way. If you can arrange transportation, try a hike through. There are many trails to explore in the Baker Lake area, car camp at one of the campgrounds along the Baker Lake road and explore them all.It's also possible to hike this trail from the southern trailhead. Located near the Anderson Creek Sno-Park, the route parallels Baker Lake, staying high on the slope and within the trees. In spring, wildflowers bloom alongside the trail.At 1.8 miles a spur trail on your left leads to the Anderson Point Campground. This is a nice sidetrip or turn-around, since it takes you down to the lake. The best views, however, are found if you continue to the Maple Grove Campground at 3.8 miles."

From the summit, it’s possible to see six (yes, six!) volcanoes spanning two states. Baker, Glacier, Adams, Rainier, St. Helens and Hood wait patiently for you to climb the more-than-moderately steep path to the summit of Crystal Peak, where you can take in beautiful snow-capped majesty from the top. Begin at an unmarked trailhead on the left-hand side of Highway 410. The trail immediately crosses a delightful stream, which you’ll be even more thankful for on the way down; it’s a great spot to stop and dip your feet after four miles of relentless downhill. Cross the water using a footlog with a handrail, and get ready to climb. Quite a bit of elevation is gained in the first mile and a half, using switchbacks that zig zag through a less-than-inspiring second-growth forest. The best part about this section is the shade, and occasional peek-a-boo views of Rainier.Reach a signed junction at the 1.5 mile mark, and take the right trail to Crystal Peak. It’s counterintuitive, since the trail to the peak descends while the left-hand trail to Crystal Lake climbs, but don’t worry, you’ll make up that elevation loss, and then some. This section is your only reprieve from near-constant uphill. You can enjoy the forest here, which becomes slightly more pastoral, with vanilla leaf and queens cup creating a green carpet under the trees. Break out onto a talus slope shortly after the junction and take in the views -- at the end of the slope you’ll re-enter forest and resume your uphill trudge. Continue through this forest for another mile, and finally begin hiking through lush green meadows. From here on out you have uninterrupted views of Rainier, and closer to hand, a plethora of wildflowers. Beargrass, tiger lilies, lupine, phlox, even magenta indian paintbrush (endemic to Mount Rainier National Park) accompany you on your climb. And climb you will. As you complete several long switchbacks across the south-facing slope, your view is ever-changing. St. Helens is the first to come into view, then Hood. Glacier and Baker appear at a west-facing rocky outcropping just short of the summit with evidence of the lookout that used to sit atop Crystal Peak. Turn around here and see Adams looming at you to the east. The last push to the summit is quite steep, but thankfully quite short, where you can take in all six peaks, as well as Crystal Lakes far below you. Crystal Mountain and Sourdough Gap are to the north, while the Cowlitz Chimneys and Shriner Peak are southeast-facing landmarks. Take time at lunch to peruse your map and try to identify as many other landmarks as you can."

This trail was built and dedicated to him, with a memorial placed at the high point on the ridge. The route isn't heavily used by hikers, but it is popular with birds--birds on the ground and in the air.You can expect to find grouse scurrying through the brush and Lewis's woodpecker pounding on the trees. In the air, look for a mix of northern flickers, bluebirds, meadowlarks, and the ever-present red-tailed hawks. If birds aren't enough of an aerial display, this is also butterfly heaven in late spring. Birds don't do it for you? Well, deer and elk also roam the region, and no one can find fault with the spectacular views--especially from the site of the Westberg Memorial at the top of the ridge.The trail starts on an old jeep track that first crosses an irrigation canal on a set of railroad timbers, and then heads up a steep gully. Be cautious because this stretch of trail is prime snake terrain. At about 0.3 mile, the trail splits, with both paths leading to the same junction about a mile farther up the route, so you can actually turn this into a short loop. Go right. From the split, the trail (both of them) climbs steeply. Indeed, in the 1.5 miles from the split to the memorial site, the trail gains almost 1800 feet in elevation, all without benefit of switchbacks.As the trail climbs, the scenery gets even better. Birds are likely to keep you company along the entire trek, and amazing flower displays are possible all around: brodiaea, lupine, balsamroot, phlox, paintbrush, yellow asterlike beauties, microsensis, and others. When the bitterroot is in bloom, any exposed rocky soil area flushes pink with its blooms.The memorial site, which can be seen from all along the trail, offers stunning views of the Kittitas Valley and the sweep of the Cascade Range, with Mount Stuart capping the mountain scene. Continue another 3.0 miles if you want to get to the University of Washington's Manastash Ridge Observatory."

Kids will love this hike for that reason, so be prepared to go slow and enjoy all the little wonders that surround you. If you need to tempt them on, tell them about the pebbled beach that waits at the end of the trail, where there are old rail lines to clamber around and explore.

Go right on the paved path, and then straight at a second junction, following signs to Myrtle Falls. Climb moderately to arrive at the very scenic bridge over Edith Creek at 0.45 mile.  A short side trail leads to a popular viewpoint of Myrtle Falls.Cross the bridge to the beginning of the loop at 0.55 mile.  To the left are the more immediate views of wildflowers and the mountain.Go left on the Golden Gate Trail. Climb gently on the wide, stepped trail through large meadows of wildflowers, mostly lupine.  There are few trees to hide the marmots which can often be seen on a sunny day.  The trail gains 780 feet over 1.0 mile to the Golden Gate, a small notch separating the lower and upper sections of the Edith Creek valley, at a junction with the Skyline Trail at 6400 feet.  Go left a very short distance to outstanding views, then retrace your steps to effectively go right (downhill) at the junction.Descend into the Paradise River Valley and new views. One half mile from the Golden Gate, rock-hop the Paradise River, then pass a junction with the Paradise Glacier Trail. This dead-end trail once led to the most popular attraction in the park: the Paradise Ice Caves, which collapsed a generation ago.  Paradise Glacier has retreated so significantly that it is technically no longer a glacier.Forty yards farther is a stone monument commemorating the first ascent of Mount Rainier in August 1870.  Sluiskin, a Yakima Indian, guided Hazard Stevens and P.B. Van Trump up the Muir snowfield, then waited here for their return.  In appreciation, they named the nearby waterfall for him.  (See the note below for more information about this historic climb.)Sluiskin Falls is just beyond the monument, but it cannot be seen from the trail.  Pass by the top of the falls at 6000 feet, then descend. Where the trail crosses the Paradise River again at 5500 feet, Sluiskin Falls remains hidden by trees and the narrowness of its canyon.Follow signs to Paradise, bypassing junctions to the Lakes Trail and 4th Crossing Trail. Climb gently back to 5600 feet to complete the loop of 2.9 miles.  Return to the stone steps for a full round trip of 4.0 miles.Note: Stevens and Van Trump probably did not stand on the true summit of Mount Rainier, but they were credited with the first ascent, two months ahead of geologists Samuel Emmons and Allen Wilson.Sluiskin refused to climb higher than 9200 feet. Other natives had similarly stopped short of the summit, largely because of Sluiskin’s grandfather, who decades earlier had climbed the highest of any native on Takhoma (Mount Rainier). He had not summitted, and strongly advised against it, reporting that Takhoma was inhabited by an evil spirit who dwelt in a fiery lake on its summit.(Source: “The Stevens and Van Trump Ascent of Mount Rainier, August 1870”, Northwest Discovery - The Journal of Northwest History and Natural History, Northwest Press.)"

Even before the historic Paradise Inn was constructed in 1916, the Paradise valley has long been one of the state’s most beloved hiking destinations because of it's southern exposure, giving it a longer season than its north side counterpart, Sunrise. In peak season (July and August) your trip along the Skyline Trail will be filled with views of cascading waterfalls, mighty glaciers and subalpine meadows brimming with colorful splashes of lupines, mountain heather, scarlet paintbrush, cascade asters and bistort. Depart from the Paradise parking lot and locate the trailhead behind the Jackson Visitor Center. The crosshatched system of trails heading out of Paradise is intricate, so make sure to stop by the visitor center to pick up a map if you didn't bring one in your pack. Proceed north, following signage for the Skyline Trail. Continuing on, you will quickly encounter a split for a few ancillary trails including the Waterfall Trail and the Dead-horse Creek Trail. The west leg of the Waterfall Trail is a nice detour in wildflower season as it leads you through lupine filled switchbacks, but for now continue straight on the Skyline Trail. The initial grade from the parking lot is steep, but it will eventually ease into a more forgiving climb after about 0.4 miles. As the intensity of the trail grade lessens, you will come to another split for the Dead-horse Creek Trail and Glacier Vista. Keep right and navigate a few sets of stone-carved staircases where you will be treated to some dazzling views of the commanding 14,410 foot peak known as Tahoma or “great white mountain” to native tribes. You will eventually pass Glacier Vista on your left, where hikers often congregate for some of the best photo opportunities that the trail offers. At 6,300 feet, Glacier Vista also serves as an unofficial turnaround for many visitors who are not enthused by the prospects of taking on some of the more serious climbing that lies ahead. As a result, the foot traffic tends to thin out a bit after Glacier Vista, but be on the lookout for a new crowd, hoary marmots. These cute rodents often claim lazy ownership over the path and can be seen exercising their unique brand of mischievous grazing as they prepare for their eight to nine months of winter hibernation. Although the natural beauty of Mount Rainier incites a powerful desire to explore and wander off trail, you are reminded to stay on the path and avoid approaching any wildlife you encounter, so as to preserve the park’s delicate ecosystem.Over the next half mile, hike along the Nisqually Glacier as the trail loops around in a hairpin turn and moves southeast toward Panorama Point. After that half mile, you will reach a junction for Pebble Creek and Camp Muir. This is the point where summit-bound climbers diverge, destined for the seemingly endless trek up the Muir snowfield to reach Camp Muir for the night. You however will continue straight to the southeast and arrive at Panorama Point after a short quarter mile of travel. Just a shade under an elevation of 7,000 feet, Panorama Point provides stunning views of the Paradise valley, Mount St. Helens, Mount Adams and even Mount Hood on a clear day. Panorama Point also has a pit toilet to the northwest that is open in the summer and stands as the highest elevation facilities available to hikers outside of Camp Muir. If you do use these facilities, please make sure to latch the door from the outside when you leave so wildlife does not mistakenly wander in and become trapped. From Panorama Point you will be directed along a path carved into a steep snowfield to the east. Although the signage labels this as part of the Skyline Trail, some consider this section of the ‘low skyline’ to be a shortcut and prefer the more stable footing of the high skyline trail to the north. If you do not wish to brave the steep and icy conditions of the snowfield, continue north up the high Skyline Trail. After half a mile of travel you will loop around and rejoin the low skyline.Following this merger, continue your descent for another half mile and you will reach the junction for the Golden Gate Trail. This is a more direct route back to the Paradise parking lot that shaves a mile off your overall journey, but deprives you of the serene Sluiskin Falls, the Van Trump Monument and the accomplishment of completing the full Skyline loop. So, proceed southwest and continue on the Skyline Trail. You will arrive at the Sluiskin Falls and Paradise Glacier Trail junction after 0.6 miles. The Paradise Glacier Trail to your left is a dead ended spur trail that once hosted views of large ice caves at the edge of the glacier. Unfortunately, the caves have since thawed and as a result the Glacier Trail has waned in popularity. Continue south and you will immediately encounter the Stevens Van Trump Historic Monument, which commemorates the first documented ascent of Mount Rainier by P.B. Van Trump and General Hazard Stevens in 1870. You will then hike 0.4 miles past the monument and arrive at the Lake Trails turnoff, a 4-mile trail that detours toward Reflection Lakes and Louise Lake and eventually loops back to Paradise. If you are not looking to extend your journey significantly, proceed west. After about a mile of travel the Golden Gate Trail will rejoin the Skyline Trail and you will soon after arrive at the sublime Myrtle Falls. Cross the bridge over the Edith Creek Basin and quickly take a left off the path for the Myrtle Falls viewpoint and one of the trail’s best sights. After snapping some photos, rejoin the trail, continue on and a half mile later you will reach the Paradise parking lot, completing the 5.5 mile journey on the Skyline Loop.WTA Pro Tip: While these directions are written for a clockwise journey of the loop, the trail can be hiked clockwise or counter clockwise depending on your preference. Hiking counterclockwise offers a more tranquil beginning and a lower initial elevation grade, while clockwise quickly offers breathtaking views and a number of ancillary trails to explore. There are bathrooms located in the Paradise parking lot at the visitor center. If the visitor center is closed, seek out the second set of bathrooms at the Guest Service building just due east."

In addition to a myriad bird species, harbor seals, otters, salmon, and many other animals enjoy these expansive tideflats, and interested hikers can while away many hours watching active wildlife. Before you start your hiking, you'll want to be sure and have binoculars. Bring your own, or check them out from the visitor center, open Wednesday through Sunday, 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Binoculars are important; they will allow you to enjoy close-up views of the many species of dabbling and diving ducks that stop to feed in the wetlands or the several species of raptors, such as owls, harriers and kestrels, that survey the fields for prey. There are also beavers, weasels, and minks present, along with frogs and butterflies. Nisqually offers a complete ecosystem worth spending some time observing and appreciating. Be sure to grab an information pamphlet, which includes a map of the hiking trails in the area. There are several hiking options in the refuge, but the most exciting is the Nisqually Estuary Boardwalk Trail. This trail starts at the visitor center and is accessed by walking one-half mile on the Twin Barnes Loop trail. After half a mile of hiking along an old boardwalk that sits just above the wetlands, hikers will reach a fork for the Twin Barns Observation Platform. This is a good stopping point for hikers with young ones. Venture out to the platform and enjoy views out to Puget Sound to the west and the tidelands below your feet. There are also two Port-A-Potties available here, one standard and one that is handicap accessible.To continue onto the boardwalk, take the right fork. Just before the trail comes to a T, a gravel path veers off to the left. This path, called the Brown Farm Dike Trail, leads to the Nisqually Estuary Boardwalk Trail. Jutting far out into the delta, the boardwalk runs a full mile, taking hikers above the water when the tide is in. When it's out, folks will be treated to mudflats peppered with shorebirds searching for food.The trail features an observation tower, an enclosed viewing platform, several push-outs for those who want to linger with their binoculars and two covered viewing platforms. There are thoughtful touches, like the areas with lower railings and mesh coverings to allow unobstructed views for kids and those in wheelchairs, as well as informative signs all along the trail. The highlight is the Puget Sound Viewing Platform at the end of the boardwalk, which provides a 360-degree view, including McAllister Creek, the Olympics, Mount Rainier and several islands in Puget Sound.Returning the way you came, either retrace your steps, or complete the Twin Barnes Loop, taking time to detour out to the Riparian Forest Overlook just before arriving to the parking lot. Trails at Nisqually National Wildlife Refuge are open sunrise to sunset every day, and there is a $3 per car vehicle charge. Parts of this trail will have an annual seasonal closure from October to January for waterfowl hunting season. And although Nisqually National Wildlife Refuge is not open to hunting, waterfowl hunting does occur on Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife land immediately adjacent to the trail."

Make a pilgrimage in June and be rewarded with a kingdom of brilliantly blooming rhodo-dendrons.On a well-built and well-maintained trail, begin in a mature forest of fir and hemlock. The way is pretty straightforward. The trail angles up the mountain, steeply at times, but never at an insane angle. The way is dry, lined with salal and under a tunnel of rhododendrons. Mount Zion ranks as one of the supreme rhody hikes in the Olympics.Big blackened snags stand as reminders to the large-scale fires that swept over this corner of the Olympic National Forest many decades ago. After marching up a ridge, the trail sweeps west and then makes a wide sweep back to the east, steadily gaining elevation. Negotiate a short series of switchbacks before skirting a series of basalt ledges.At 1.8 miles, arrive on the rocky summit. A fire tower perched here until 1975. The sur-rounding forest has slowly been encroaching upon the view, blocking much of what was once a supreme vista. Mount Baker, the San Juan Islands, Puget Sound and the Quim-per Peninsula can still be seen over the tops of tenacious conifers. But for the premiere showing-the promised views-carry on a little farther.Locate a trail heading southeast from the summit and follow it. Pass a spring that once provided water for the fire-lookout personnel. Continue on good tread and after 0.5 mile of fairly level hiking emerge on a huge outcropping, your portal to panoramic pleasures. Using caution, climb a little onto the open ledge, and then enjoy the view. Mount Townsend dominates the southern horizon, while the rocky high wall of the Gray Wolf Ridge commands the western sky. It's a heavenly view, and what you'd expect from a mountain named Zion."

But the whole package includes old-growth forest, gorgeous wildflowers, and stunning views into the Alpine Lakes Wilderness from both sides of the pass below Kendall Peak, where the Katwalk begins.Start out from the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) main parking lot, passing a picnic table in the shade, and coming upon a ‘T’.  Stay to the right; the left is merely the connector trail from the upper parking lot. In another 100 feet, pass a gravelly overgrown trail on the left. This is the unmaintained Commonwealth Creek Trail, a portion of the original Cascade Crest Trail, the precursor to the PCT.You'll continue on along the wide trail, climbing gently past the lush and varied vegetation lining the trail. In late August or early September, blueberries are a treat. The trail winds around at first, then heads into a series of lengthy straight sections. The second section passes through forest still exhibiting damage from the summer storm of 2011, when the trail had to be closed briefly in order to clear gigantic blowdowns.Approaching the 2-mile mark, the trail breaks out into open talus, enters the Alpine Lakes Wilderness, then begins slowly dropping 100 feet. At 2.25 miles, a small waterfall on the steep uphill side of the trail alerts you to the stream crossings ahead. Two sequential crossings are aided by good balance and/or trekking poles. In high runoff, there is not enough room to avoid minor splashing. As always, be safe when crossing high water, and if it seems too much for you, don't be afraid to turn around. 500 feet beyond, stay right at the signed junction and climb to a switchback, entering shady forest. After crossing a stream (the same one as below), the trail briefly follows a gravelly runoff bed into a rock formation. The trail can be lost here; watch for where it dodges sharply to the right, sometimes hidden in shadows. Continue on through old-growth forest, where blacktail deer roam stealthily.At 4.25 miles, cross a nearly flat ridge top where large fallen trees bear evidence to a past storm. Camping is possible here, but there is no water. Traverse a steep hillside through beautiful old-growth forest, eventually breaking out into open talus at about 5000 feet of elevation.  In season, the slopes feature a dazzling array of wildflowers, including lupine, paintbrush, phlox, penstemon, and columbine. This area is affectionately known as Kendall Gardens. The trail is steep, rocky, and exposed, offering unobstructed views of Lundin Peak and Red Mountain ahead, and Mount Rainier behind. At 5400 feet, the trail turns a corner to the right and changes heading to almost due east. Along the final up-and-down half mile, lingering snow can make the way treacherous; check trail conditions.Cross the pass below Kendall Peak and welcome new views.  Walk the narrowest portion of the Katwalk if you choose (150 yards). Or just drink in the views of Gold Creek Valley and the peaks of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness."

Hikers can go out and back or do a traverse with a car at each end.The Panther Creek trail starts in cool lodgepole pine forest, climbing to a traverse underneath a cliffside at 2000 feet. Here, hikers descend, losing much of the elevation they’ve gained, until the trail touches the creek. At that point, it turns up again to a formerly bridged crossing with designated campsites. From here, the trail crosses small streams and avalanche slopes, and at 2700 feet of elevation, 4.75 miles in, it contours away from the creek and heads up to Fourth of July Pass, one mile distant and 800 feet higher.The best views are at the far end of Fourth of July Pass, and the nicest place to camp is about a mile beyond at Fourth of July Camp with views of Colonial Peak, Snowfield Peak and Neve Glacier. Probably the best way to see this section is as a traverse from Colonial Creek Campground or the opposite. If you can swing two cars, the whole walk would be 11.7 miles.

Spring is the best time to visit as you'll likely find the local desert full of migratory songbirds and the lake alive with nesting waterfowl. You might also happen across coyotes, badgers, deer, and snakes.To access the upper portion of a 1.3-mile loop above Hog Lake, hike 1.2 miles along the main road to a trailhead/horse unloading area. After enjoying the loop in the northern highlands above the lake, drop down the short trail to the lakeshore to experience the views there. The access to Hog Lake itself is found down the steep hill about 0.2 mile from the trailhead parking area along the southern side of the upper loop. A nice fisher's trail leads along the north shore of Hog Lake to wind around the shore for great reflection views, photo opportunities, and wildlife.Spring brings flower blooms to this glorious desert country. Yellow bells, desert bluebells, sagebrush buttercups, and even some hedgehog cactus blanket the desert here. This is a fascinating transition area as the Columbia Basin slowly gives way to the dry pine country found farther east. As the land climbs in elevation, it draws more rainfall, and thus sports more and more woodland stands of ponderosa pine trees. Just 10 miles west of here you will find no trees, but there are trees here. Those small groves of pine bring fascinating life to the otherwise desert landscape. An astounding array of birds, especially, take advantage of them. We noted one tree about a mile into the route that sported more than sixty violet-green swallows lined up on its branches to warm in the sun."

The principal trailhead is at a small parking area along 248th Ave SE just north of SE 13th Pl, under a high-voltage power line. Alternatively, the Preserve can be reached from the north via an initially-unsigned trail beginning on Main Dr at the power line crossing. There is an information board at the trailhead. There is no entry fee, and the preserve is open from dawn to dusk. For a map, see the Trail Maps link at www.sammamishwalks.org. The 1.7 mile hike is nearly level, with an elevation change of about 60 feet.The Main Trail that leaves the parking area skirts the west side of the wetland and continues north to reach Main Dr. The Main Trail is open to pedestrian and equestrian use only (no bikes) and dogs are allowed on a short leash. However, Ann's Walking Trail, that leaves the Main Trail and circles around the south, east and north sides of the wetland, is open only to walkers. Dogs, and even joggers, are not permitted there to avoid disturbing the abundant wildlife.Begin your hike from the parking area, passing a few backyards of homes on Windsor Dr SE, and reach the Preserve boundary in about a quarter mile. In another 500 feet, come to a junction with the southern end of Ann's Walking Trail. You can go either way here, since the Main Trail and Ann's Trail provide a loop around the wetland.If you turn right onto Ann's Trail you will come to a sturdy bridge over the outlet stream from the wetland. The stream has the interesting name--Laughing Jacobs Creek, and no doubt some colorful history. To the left of the bridge, note the large beaver dam that raises the water level of the wetland. To the right of the bridge a smaller beaver dam is visible downstream. The ongoing trail passes very close to the east end of the large dam, so you will be able enjoy a close-up view of its construction.A bit farther along, you'll reach a junction with a connecting trail to the Beaver Lake Preserve, a Sammamish city park. The connecting trail is marked at this end with a makeshift sign declaring it to be ""Fred's Way,"" and it leads in about a quarter mile to The Beaver Lake Preserve's 1.2 mile loop trail. So it's possible to include both Preserves in a single hike. For additional details, see our Hiking Guide entry for the Beaver Lake Preserve.The ongoing Ann's Trail offers many views through the trees out to the wetland. It's hard to judge the depth of the water, but it's shallow enough everywhere for a few lilypads to grow. You are likely to see and hear at least a few ducks, depending on the season, and perhaps some wild geese too. Even if you are quiet they may become aware of your presence and move farther away, so you may have difficulty getting close enough for photos. You might find binoculars helpful for good waterfowl viewing.Ann's Trail loops around to the north end of the wetland, where a viewing platform looks out across the water. In the distance, you can make out the No 1 and No 2 summits of West Tiger Mountain. A sign on the viewing platform indicates it is under 24 hour video surveillance, although the camera is not obvious. So smile, and be on your good behavior! You never know who might be watching, or who might review the archived video in the future.Soon after you leave the viewing platform, Ann's Trail rejoins the Main Trail about 1/3 mile north of its southern junction. Unless you want to explore the northern extension of the Main Trail on its way to Main Dr, you can turn left here and head back south on the Main Trail to rejoin your incoming route and return to your trailhead at the parking area."

After fawning and awing, walk along the edge of precipitous cliffs gazing at the twinkling waters of Mountain Lake 1000-feet below. This is the heart of Moran State Park, and when it comes to pure scenery, wildlife observations, and top-notch trails, you'll be hard-pressed to find an area surpassing this.For both loops, begin by walking 0.25 mile down a dirt road to the boat launch. Here, the trail takes off north, hugging the western shore of Mountain Lake. This section of trail is named for Bonnie Sliger, a popular Youth Conservation Corps supervisor who tragically died in a fall in 1977.Skirting the placid shoreline graced with mature timber, keep your eyes and ears tuned for woodpeckers, eagles, ducks, and osprey. Watch too for kingfishers and heron. While you're scoping for birds, a few of Moran's ubiquitous black-tailed deer will probably be watching you.In 1.25 miles reach a junction. To continue circling 200-acre Mountain Lake, proceed right. Meandering along pristine shoreline, the trail carries on with its easy journey. A small ledge requiring a climb of 50 feet or so is the only break from near-level hiking on the entire loop. At 3.25 miles reach a small dam at the lake's southern tip. From this point enjoy good views of Mount Constitution, cliffs and tower revealed, hovering above the lake.Avoiding a side trail leading to Mount Pickett, continue by crossing Cascade Creek on a bridge just below the dam. Here another trail diverges left, this one following Cascade Creek and leading to falls and lake of same name. Head right, hugging more Mountain Lake shoreline and closing the loop.Mount Constitution-bound hikers should head left at 1.25 miles from the trailhead onto the Twin Lakes Trail, at the junction that comes along as you're hiking the lakeshore. Follow the well-trodden path for 1 mile, gaining an easy 200 feet of elevation to another junction (elev. 1100 ft). Trails leading to the little Twins and to Mount Pickett take off right.You, however, are headed left. Take a break-you've got quite a climb ahead of you. In deep timber, begin your ascent. The trail steepens, gaining 1000 feet in less than a mile as it works its way up Constitution. En route ignore a trail taking off right (North Trail), but consider the spurs leading left to nice viewpoints.At 4 miles from your start, emerge on 2409-foot Mount Constitution's broad summit. Don't let gawking tourists who drove to the summit detract from your experience; well-earned views await. Head for Constitution's unique stone tower. Constructed by Civilian Conservation Corps crews in 1936, it's a facsimile of a twelfth-century Caucasus Mountains military fortification. From this roof top of the San Juan Islands, enjoy an unobstructed view of island, mountain, Sound, and strait from the Olympics to Rainier, Vancouver Island to British Columbia's Coast Range.Now it's time to amend your views on Constitution, adding to the sights seen by continuing your hike. Leave the summit and crowds via the Little Summit Trail. Losing very little elevation, saunter for a mile on the summit plateau through stands of lodgepole pine and along the edge of sheer cliffs plummeting straight down to Mountain Lake.After skirting frog-incubating Summit Lake, bear left at a junction (the trail right leads to Cold Springs and Cascade Lake), and in another mile reach another junction (elev. 1900 ft), bearing left once again. Begin your at times steep descent back to Mountain Lake, arriving at your vehicle and closing the loop in 0.75 mile."

Go in the spring when the tread is snow-free and the waterfall is flowing at full volume. But keep in mind, with limited parking at the trailhead, this trailhead can get crowded.The hike starts from a trailhead at the school bus turn-around off SE Mt. Si Road--be sure not to block this turnaround if you're hiking this trail during the week! Also note that the tread consists of loose rock in places, so sturdy shoes or boots will help keep your ankles and feet happy on this hike. If you are hiking with children, keep them close by as there are some steep drop-offs along the trail. Walk around the gate and follow the gently inclining Mount Teneriffe Road for approximately two miles, to an intersection signed for Teneriffe Falls. This is the start of the new trail to the falls. Turn right at this junction and begin climbing. For hikers familiar with the old bootleg trail that was painfully steep and dangerously slippery, the new switchbacked trail is a delight! If you’re looking for a workout, don’t worry, you’ll still get it. Over the next mile, you’ll gain most of the elevation on this hike, approximately 770 vertical feet. Thanks to the work of the Department of Natural Resources and the Mountains-to-Sound Greenway, the new trail makes the effort enjoyable.The 22 switchbacks up to the base of the falls wind in and out of tree cover. Enjoy the second- and third-growth forest you’re walking through and the sounds and sights of the nearby stream flowing from Teneriffe Falls. You might glimpse sections of the old bootleg trail that ran parallel to the stream along the way. Though it may be tempting to explore, please stick to the new trail! It was built to provide a safer route for hikers and to minimize erosion and sediment in the fish-bearing stream. As you near the end of the trail, you’ll get a view of the lower part of Teneriffe Falls. Snap a photo, and then continue up the last couple switchbacks to a viewpoint for the upper falls. You’ll reach this point (unsigned) approximately three miles from the trailhead and 2370 feet in elevation. Due to funding issues, this last section has not been brought up to standards. As a result, DNR does not consider the trail complete. The viewing area is a small, mostly flat area with a steep downhill drop-off, so be careful where you step and where you set your pack. If you choose to scramble down to the level area between the upper and lower falls, be aware of slippery rocks and sketchy hand and foot holds. Both make it difficult to get down and then back up to the trail safely. For groups of three people or fewer, this makes a nice snack or lunch spot. Larger groups should choose a spot down trail to take a break.WTA Pro Tip: If you're interested in extending your hike, it's possible to do so! Return to the junction with the road-to-trail conversion and continue heading up and up. After 2.25 miles of hiking, you'll come to a fork in the trail. The left branch is a trail that accesses the summit of Mount Si, just about 1 mile away. Alternatively, you can stick to the road-to-trail and in another 2.5 miles you'll arrive at the summit of Mount Teneriffe. Hiking all the way to the summit of Teneriffe makes for a 13.8 mile roundtrip hike."

Silver fir, Douglas-fir, mountain hemlock, western red cedar, Alaskan yellow cedar and near the top, noble fir.Several switchbacks take you higher and higher. Reach a pretty, open ridge, full of alpine blueberry shrubs. You then enter rocky outcroppings of brilliant, sparkling white granite. Nice rock steps guide you up further. Soon you're on the summit. Nowhere in this area can you get views like this as easily as you've made it here. Washington's newest wilderness area--the Wild Sky--is laid out in front of you, and above it, views for miles! Glacier Peak, Evergreen Mountain and the Monte Cristo range are to the north and Mounts Baring and Index to the west. Mounts Daniel and Hinman with their broad glaciers as well as the striking Summit Chief, Chimney Rock and other jagged peaks are proudly displayed.Have lunch on the small summit which is sure to be crowded on a sunny weekend day. About half a dozen hikers can perch comfortably among the rocks at one time. Be careful though, as there is an unforgiving sheer cliff at the northern edge and it's a mighty long way down. Those with squirmy kids should be patient and safe."

Backcountry permits and reservations are required to stay at these sites. Contact the Visitor's Information Center in Port Angeles for further information.  The route is for the most part flat, but sometimes requires the use of ropes or makeshift ladders to climb up and over high rocky bluffs on the beach. Occasionally, it's possible to hike around these rather than over, when the tide is right, so having a tide table may be a wise 11th essential when undertaking this hike. It is worth noting that much of this hike is a route, so requires route-finding, since hikers mostly walk along the beach and not on a delineated trail. The views of the mighty Pacific, as well as the occasional bald eagle soaring between seastacks and arches make this hike a goal for many visitors and residents of Washington. River crossings are required along the North Coast Route -- the Ozette River should be forded only at low tide. Note that it may be impassable in winter and during periods of heavy rain."

It became part of the Snohomish County Park system in 2000, and now is in the process of returning to the wild state it once was. We hikers can watch this dynamic landscape by following the many trails that run through it. The trails are all well signed and a map can be printed or downloaded to your smartphone from the Snohomish County Parks website. Hike the perimeter trails for a good sampling of the area and a nice hike of about 5 miles. Take a minute to read the trailhead kiosk before you start, then head down the Mainline trail from the parking lot. A short interpretive loop walk along the Whispering Firs trail on the right will give you a nice overview of the plants found along the trails and their role in the ecosystem. Once back on the Mainline trail, walk a short way until you intersect with the Wetland Plateau trail on the left. Turn on this trail and follow this very gentle uphill grade. Here you will notice the red alder in this area. This is the most recently logged area, as alder is the first tree to grow back. Look for salmonberry and red huckleberry in the thicket of deciduous shrubs. Salmonberry has bright magenta-pink flowers in the spring and tasty orange to red berries in summer. Red huckleberry has small bell-like flowers and red berries. It is closely related to the mountain huckleberry found at higher elevations. There has been rumors of a resident bear living in these woods, perhaps you will see him if the berries are ripe.Come to a sign for the Goold overlook, where there is supposed to be a view of Mount Baker. This writer hasn't seen it, but maybe you will be lucky!  Close by is a bench to sit and listen to the birdsong. The Wetland Plateau trail intersects the Southern Traverse trail; head right on the Southern Traverse trail. This section is fairly flat and winds through a more mature second growth forest of western hemlock and western cedar. Notice the decaying alder trunks, now serving as 'habitat' trees. As they decay, these trees provide insects and nesting sites for birds and small mammals. In the spring, watch for clumps of white trillium as you hike through this section.You will soon come to a main intersection with the Forest Ridge and the Lloyd trail, stay on the Southern Traverse. The trail then drops down a little and come to Smokey's bridge, a puncheon bridge skirting a large muddy area that becomes a small pond in winter rains. Who was Smokey, one wonders, perhaps a trail worker that helped on the project? Nothing tells us, there is just the sign.  Head back up a gentle grade and intersect here with the Mainline trail and the Bigleaf trail. Take the Bigleaf trail, named for the bigleaf maple you will find growing in the park. A large spreading multi trunk tree, it is easily identified by the very large leaves that turn golden in the fall. Wander along this trail, enjoying the forest. This is truly a mixed forest, young fir, hemlock and cedar trees mix with vine maple, and alder. Underneath there is a carpeting of western bleeding heart in the spring. The Bigleaf ends in a T with the Red Alder trail. Either way on the Red Alder will take you back to the trailhead, take the left fork for a bit more wandering. This trail will wander through some large Doug fir, second growth trees that are one hundred years old. The forest returns!  You will also see some dying trees here too, western white pine being felled by disease. The bark is black and the dead branches circle the trunk in a whorled pattern. Look carefully, though, seedlings are to be found among the understory of  Oregon grape, salal and swordfern.You may finish your hike by taking the Mainline trail back toward the parking lot or continue exploring if you wish, there are thirteen miles of trail here.  Just off the Mainline trail on your way back there is a nice place for lunch at a spot labeled The Clearing, here you will find a picnic table. If you didn't bring a lunch, the Maltby Cafe, just west of  the crossing of 522 is a local favorite."

This out-and-back trail can be started from the west (Coal Creek Parkway parking lot), east (Red Town Trailhead parking lot), or from one of many spur trails along the route. Starting from the Red Town Trailhead parking lot, cross Lakemont Boulevard to the signpost indicating the Coal Creek Park Trail. Follow the soft dirt path and descend into the forest on the gently rolling trail. Pause at an information kiosk on your left to learn about the railroad and coal mining activities that took place in this area from the mid-1800s to mid-1900s.  Opposite the information kiosk, spot the airshaft of coal mine that extends over 500 feet below sea level. There is a short, 0.1 mile interpretive trail you can explore here as well.Continuing towards Coal Creek Parkway, cross a wooden bridge over Coal Creek and come upon a short spur trail to a waterfall called North Fork Falls. Take a break on one of the wooden benches here to savor the peaceful and calming flow of the rushing water.  Head back to the Coal Creek Trail and continue on the wide dirt path. Pass a sign for the Cinder Mine Trail, a newly built 0.3 mile trail that leads to a small parking area off Newcastle Golf Club Road. An aside: consider parking at this newly built parking lot. It provides access to the Coal Creek Trail via the Cinder Mine Trail, as well as  North Fork Falls. To access the falls, walk from the parking lot down the Cinder Mine Trail to the bottom. Turn right onto the Coal Creek Trail and in about 0.2 miles North Fork Falls will appear on your left. Back on the main route, about 400 feet past the Cinder Mine Trail sign you'll notice a square, roughly 8x8 foot cement footing on your left. This footing was the base of a former locomotive turntable that turned locomotives 180 degrees, enabling them to exit and enter the area. Pass the turntable site and walk through a sun-dappled gallery of towering trees reaching multiple stories above you, and come upon a wooden staircase. Head up the staircase and emerge onto a wide gravel road with a thicket of blackberry bushes lining the trail on your right. In summer, you can enjoy ripe blackberries as an impromptu snack.Continue up the gravel road, following signs for Coal Creek Parkway. Arrive at a bench overlooking a ravine to the right of the trail, and enjoy the sweeping canopied views before you. Here the trail begins descending more earnestly and will continue descending steadily as you make your way to Coal Creek Parkway.  Reach a signed junction with an option to turn right for the Primrose Trail or stay straight on the Coal Creek Trail. The Primrose Trail follows Coal Creek closely and is a lovely, scenic route. It boasts a large wooden bridge and pretty views of a waterfall called Sandstone Falls. The route is only slightly longer (about 0.1 miles) than staying on the Coal Creek Trail, and connects back up with the Coal Creek Trail after roughly 0.7 miles.  After linking back up with the Coal Creek Trail, continue to steadily descend.  The trail here becomes more rough and rooty with some narrow sections. Pass through a couple wooden bridges, and continue to descend down a wooden staircase.Emerge onto a wide, flat dirt path roughly 2.5 miles from the start of your hike. Here there are shallow access points to Coal Creek, perfect for a cool splash of water or cooling off your toes. The trail continues for about another half mile, with several additional access points to the Creek dotting the way. On your right, you will see signs for Forest Drive, an access point to a local neighborhood and the Washout Way Trail.The Coal Creek Trail continues to a small parking lot next to Coal Creek Parkway. Explore the staircase leading under Coal Creek Parkway and emerging on a trail on the other side. The trail here extends another 1.3 miles to 119th Avenue, and is an option for those looking to explore the area further before turning back.WTA Pro Tip: The Coal Creek Trail can be broken into smaller pieces for those looking for shorter options. Start the trail from the west (Coal Creek Parkway) side to take advantage of access points for wading and splashing in the creek, or start from the east (Red Town Trailhead / Cinder Mine Trailhead) side to hike to the abandoned coal mine, North Fork Falls, locomotive turntable site, or the Primrose Trail. Whatever your route, be sure to bring a map, as the network of trails in this area is intricate and extensive."

For most of its course, the trail follows the path of Barclay Creek, which is tucked into a narrow valley between Gunn and Merchant Peaks to the north and Baring Mountain to the south. Because this trail is popular (consider going on a weekday to avoid the crowds), and the area receives 150-200 inches of precipitation each year, WTA has performed trail maintenance to build turnpikes and drainage structures to ensure a passable route. Nevertheless, you may encounter muddy or watery spots along the way. Barclay Lake was not included in the Wild Sky Wilderness because of its historical use by groups larger than those permitted in wilderness areas. This makes it a great destination for Boy Scout troops, extended families, and other large outdoor outings.The trail gains a net 200 feet of elevation over its course to the lake, though there is enough up-and-down to keep you from getting bored.

Explore mossy boulders and cross multiple burbling creeks, even do a small amount of cross-country travel on the way to the piece de resistance – a 1,200 foot waterfall that streams into tiny Lipsy Lake before draining to the Taylor River. The trail takes off from the Snoqualmie Lake Trailhead, 12 miles from the beginning of the Middle Fork Snoqualmie Road. Start from the small parking area and admire the wide Taylor River as you cross a paved bridge. Pass a couple of dispersed camping sites and come to a junction with the Quartz Creek trail branching off to the left at about 0.5 miles. Take the right fork, staying on a relatively flat, rocky trail that heads through quiet forest. Gaze at moss-laden birches, western redcedars, and western hemlocks towering over you. The trail can be brushy when the understory is in bloom, but in winter and early spring it is quite wide –  hikers can walk three abreast in some sections. Along the trail, Taylor River rushes past you, and craggy Garfield Peak plays hide-and-seek through the trees. Near a creek crossing, the forest opens up, offering hikers a glimpse of a spire of Treen Peak. This is one of the few sections of the trail that also offers good sunlight - on a clear day, bask in the warmth and enjoy the view of the surrounding mountains before continuing on your way.After three miles, come to a large bridge spanning roaring Marten Creek. A bootpath veers off to the left just before the bridge – a mile’s hike up this primitive, overgrown trail takes you to Marten Lake, but your destination of Otter Falls is much more compelling, and easier to access. Take photos at the bridge and then press on, crossing roughly ten drainages before the turn-off for Otter Falls. With spring’s high waters, some of these crossings can be tricky. Hiking poles are very helpful in high water. Keep in mind that rocks can be loose or slippery with moss – don’t attempt any crossing that you feel uncomfortable tackling. You’re almost to your destination when you reach a large creek featuring an enormous culvert. Five feet in diameter, the culvert is set into the creek, just downstream from where you will cross the drainage. After crossing this drainage, it’s only about 0.3 miles to the turn off for Otter Falls. The turn is typically marked by a large cairn. Turn left into the forest, and begin climbing upslope. This is the steepest this trail gets, but it’s not a long climb, and manageable for most. After about 500 yards you’ll reach the crown of the slope. Otter Falls is visible through the trees, but the best view doesn’t come until you take a short path down to a small beach, where the imposing falls stream down a huge granite face. Though the water falls 1,200 feet, hikers who make it here can only see about 500 feet of falling water. But that’s more than enough – Otter Falls provides the perfect place to relax and enjoy lunch before heading back out to the trail and your car."

Start from the Mount Si trailhead and follow the wide, sculpted trail into second growth bigleaf maples, hemlock and ferns. A small trail peels off to the left -- ignore this and stay right. Cross a small creek, then begin climbing on rocky trail for about 0.7 miles. Along the way, signs indicate you are on the Mount Si trail. After 0.7 miles, arrive at another sign. The Mount Si trail heads left, while the Talus Loop ducks off to the right. Since it's a loop hike, you can go either way (and you'll have plenty of elevation gain on both trails) but to escape the madding crowd, turn right and begin hiking on the more rugged, narrower Talus Loop Trail. The trail traverses gradually northeast, climbing through second growth forest. Listen for birds rustling in the trees or little critters darting underfoot. After a long traverse, come to a switchback, climbing and bringing you back the way you came. Soon you'll arrive at a large talus slope. Here you can see out into the Lower Snoqualmie Valley, including a set of buildings known locally as 'Truck Town', the truck stop where many adventurers returning from a weekend refuel on gas and snacks before heading back into the Puget Sound area.

There isn’t room for many cars, so a hiker can usually find a bit of solitude here. Copper Creek is marked with a sign next to the road, and the narrow trail heads off up the left side of Copper Creek, which flows down the mountain. Begin your ascent alongside the creek, and don’t forget to stop and admire two abandoned mine shaft openings at about 0.2 miles. These anachronisms date back to an effort from 1915 when miners searched the mountains for copper and manganese. “Copper” can also be found in the ruddy colored rocks that form the streambed. Follow the creek for about a half mile, climbing steadily the whole time and occasionally crossing the creek on several plank bridges. Then switch back up above the creek, gaining even more elevation. Be sure to look out through the moss-covered trees to glimpse small views of Lake Cushman far below. Keeping an eye on the lake gives you a sense of how fast you’re climbing. After this set of switchbacks the trail will even out to gives your legs and lungs a break, and you can soak in the old-growth forest: cedars, sword ferns, salal, and all the other usual forest life.After about two miles, you’ll come to a sign announcing the “ridge loop.” To complete the loop turn either left or right. Turning right will give you a less steep ascent to the top of the ridge, a small ledge with a view facing west into the heart of the Olympics.

In spring, you'll be accompanied by a profusion of wildflowers, but look out for ticks! Most people who know this area call it ""Goose Butte"", named after a big goose spotted on the cliff above the caves back in the 1990s when the Bureau of Land Management acquired the land. The bottomland was once farmed at the turn of the century and there were a number of old homesteads on either side of the creek, but most are not visible now. You might spot an apple tree or two that were are offshoots from the original apple trees planted by the homesteaders. Nearby Rocky Ford (described in Dan Nelson's Desert Hikes book) is about 5.5 miles to the west, off Rocky Ford Road. This large BLM parcel can be accessed off Hills Road to the east or from Rocky Ford Road to the west. However, Goose Butte offers equally scenic prairie wandering, and boasts a large parking area to boot. To do this route, park on the east end of the lot and look for a two track that leads through a pass gate east of the first cave. Follow this two track northwest up to the bluff, then head west for 1.1 miles. At this point, look for a fainter two track diverging off to the southwest, down the slope. At 1.3 miles, you’ll find an historic rock house, built in 1917 (look for the inscription on the east outside wall). Then continue hiking downhill following a livestock path all the way down to Crab Creek. Songbirds, waterfowl, and hawks dip and sing in the air as you make your way along the narrow path. At your feet, look for buttercups and bitterroot, among many other types of wildflower.From this point, you’ll be at 1.7 miles and can loop back along Crab Creek to the parking area for a total of 3 miles. A more desirable route, if you have time, is to continue hiking along Crab Creek heading west for another mile or two. WTA Pro Tip: Crab Creek cannot be crossed safety in the spring months, but later in the summer or the fall it can be crossed in several areas. If you feel like you can do it safely, explore the lands on the south side of the creek and even hike all the way to Rocky Ford for a nice long 10 or 12 mile loop hike."

While the trail will make you work, the reward at the end is well worth the sweat. When you reach the lowest of the Thornton Lakes you’ll be faced with a decision: relax near the alpine waters, or scramble the rocky ridge that leads to Trappers Peak. Either way, you can’t go wrong. The trail starts modestly, traversing the hillside through the forest and crossing a couple creeks with minimal elevation gain. Look closely and you’ll notice remnants of the decommissioned logging road you’re hiking on as you ramble along the first two miles. When you reach the end of the road, the trail will start to your left and begin to gain elevation. This section switchbacks through dense forest, and careful footing is needed to avoid the numerous roots that protrude into the trail. At roughly mile four you’ll enter North Cascades National Park, where the trail will continue to climb until you reach a signed junction. Here you’ll need to decide if you want to spend some time by the lake, or continue ascending for sweeping panoramic views. If you choose the lake, head left at the junction and travel downhill for roughly half a mile to reach the lowest of the Thornton Lakes. If you decide to scramble the peak, take the right fork and get ready to gain some more elevation. The scramble to Trappers Peak will take you almost 1,000 feet higher in less than a mile before you can enjoy the views. The trail to the peak is rugged, and at times requires the use of your hands to assist the climb. There isn’t much to speak of in exposure, but use careful footing, as there are sections where taking a fall could mean tumbling downhill a good ways.As you reach the top, just under 6,000 feet, you’ll be treated to sweeping views of a number of North Cascades gems. In front of you, the Picket Range, with spiny, dagger-like peaks and dramatic glaciers. To the west, Mount Triumph looms above and the upper Thornton Lakes are visible down below. Turning around, you’ll find incredible views of the Skagit River and farmlands stretching as far as you can see, and the town of Newhalem can be spotted nestled alongside Highway 20."

After snapping a few pictures and admiring the cascade, either turn back and return to Ohanapecosh Campground or continue upstream for another 0.5 mile to Stevens Canyon Road. (Stay right at the junction a few hundred yards above the falls; the left fork leads to Route 91, Olallie Creek.)Cross the wide road near the tollbooths, and head up the wide, well-signed trail to the Grove of the Patriarchs. The trail skirts along the west bank of the river and, in 0.5 mile (mile 2.5), crosses the river on a narrow suspension bridge. This bridge is usually very slick, so cross with extreme care, making full use of both handrails, and enter the cathedral-like stand of ancient trees that is the Grove of the Patriarchs. After enjoying the scenic splendor of the forest, return the way you came, or follow the Stevens Canyon Road and SR 123 south to Ohanapecosh Campground for a quicker return.Author’s Rating: More DifficultSome previous snowshoe experience helpful. Some winter survival skills recommended (basic knowledge of avalanche evaluation, emergency shelter construction, etc.). Elevation gain is usually less than 1000 feet with a gradual slope."

Maple trees blaze red, orange and yellow in autumn, willows provide shade in spring, and the stark skeletons of those trees stand out against grey skies in winter. With various bridges crossing it, it's possible to venture all the way around it, or create smaller loops as needed. With ample parking around the lake, it's possible to begin walking at just about any point. But, by beginning at St. John's hospital, it is possible to take advantage of the ""Solar System Walk"". Dedicated in September of 2001, the Friends of Galileo Astronomy Club installed stone plaques along one side of the lake based on the Thousand-Yard Model of the solar system. As you walk the wide graveled path, you'll pass informative stone plaques representing all the planetary bodies including the moon and the sun in our solar system. Each one features details about the planet it represents including basic data and some interesting trivia. In order to see all of them, you'll want to stay on the path closest to the road (though you can follow the path when it dips below all the bridges, rather than having to cross the street)The plaques line the west side of the lake, so they'll guide you all the way from the south to the north end. From here, it's easy to complete your loop by walking around the north end of the lake, noting the water feature and heading south. Along the way you'll pass many trees (labeled with their species and common name), the entrance to a lovely Japanese Garden, cultivated on one of the islands in the lake, and the open area that serves as the grounds for the towns 4th of July logging festival. Soon, you'll pass a beautifully cultivated rhododendron garden. Stray from the gravel path and rock hop through the barkdust to enjoy the many varied species that bloom here, before rejoining the trail south. Further south, walk through a large playground with bathrooms and plenty of room for the kids to run around, and then pass the entrance to Lions Island. If you choose to cross onto the island, it's a nice side trip, and you can see a large totem pole up close. A visit to the lake can be a quick jog, a longer walk, or a day-long picnic and dawdle. Whatever you prefer, it's a nice way to spend a day."

From woods to meadows to panoramic views and even a historic lookout, it just doesn't get much better than this.There are a few organizations and individuals to be grateful for, as otherwise there'd be no hike to talk about here. Due to flooding, the Suiattle River Road -- which provides access for Green Mountain -- took a big hit in 2003 and a final blow in 2006 when a landslide demolished it, cutting off motorized access to all hikes in the area. It took years of advocacy and the tireless work of Washington Trails Association, the Forest Service, the Swinomish Tribe, and various local governments to finally get the road rebuilt and reopened in 2014.And then there's the lookout on top, originally built in 1933 and used for years to house seasonal fire lookouts. In 1987 it was added to the National Register of Historic Places, and in 2010, shortly after being rebuilt, it was threatened with dismantling when an environmental group sued the forest service for allowing the use of helicopters in its restoration. After years of advocacy, legal battle, and a court ruling to have it removed, the Green Mountain Lookout was finally saved and protected by an act of Congress (motivated by unified championing from Washington State senators and representatives) and the signature of President Obama.In the meantime, neither lack of road access, trail maintenance, nor legal wranglings deterred the members of the Friends of Green Mountain Lookout, who mountain-biked more than 12 miles up forest roads, waded through the brushy meadows, and carried 50-pound packs full of tools and supplies to preserve and maintain the lookout. Give them all a thought as you drive up the rebuilt forest roads, walk the well maintained trail, and admire the perfect lookout crowning this peak.Now it's time to go see what all that hard work bestowed! Pack a few layers as it can be hot on the exposed upper slopes and pretty darn crisp when it gets breezy -- you're going to 6500 feet. Throw in more water than you think you'll need for yourself and your canine accomplice (if applicable) as there's little water access once above the trees. And if you have the kind of life that's hard to explain to family over Thanksgiving but allows you to hike on a weekday, you'd be wise to do so. All the grandeur that is Green Mountain is popular with the synthetically clad masses of the great Northwest who know a good thing when they see it.The first mile and a half or so winds through forest with the occasional Douglas-fir big enough to warrant a second look. Emerging from the woods, it's hard to know what to admire first, the big views of pointy White Chuck, hulking Glacier Peak behind you, or the lush meadows ahead and above which are gorgeous in every season.In the spring, there's no doubt why they called it Green Mountain (though the peak here is not Green Mountain but its shoulder); in the summer there's a flower show with an extensive guest list (orange Glacier Lilies and red and yellow Columbine dip their heads, scarlet Paintbrush, Blue Bells, purple Penstemon, and fields of white Valerian) as well as plenty of biting bugs to pollinate them all. In the fall, the colors are so vivid they hardly seem real. But there they are, glowing red and orange around every corner in the autumn sun. If you're the type that likes that sort of thing, you're going to want a fully charged camera battery. Or two.Beautiful as it is, this trail is all business. Switchbacking steadily for another mile or so brings you to an expanse of trailside blueberry bushes we call The Opium Fields for their power to cause hikers to forget all about the views ahead, the setting sun, and everything else besides the abundance of blue, tangy goodness. In the fall, it's hard to believe this swath of glowing red leaves paired with sweeping views is mere miles from the car.Working your way around this shoulder peak, you'll drop down 100 feet (this will be far more noteworthy on the way back) through fields of heather, which bloom purple in the summer, to a couple of small ponds and established campsites at around 5200 feet. Look up to see Green Mountain ahead of you, with the lookout now visible, 1300 feet and a mile of walking above. It's hard work from here, and the trail is steep, but the view of Cascade peaks improves with every switchback until it crescendos at the summit ridge where peaks to the north and east become visible. Marmots might whistle at you from here, and the occasional Ptarmigan mama might put on a show to distract you from her fuzzy-feathered offspring in the tall grass.From the summit ridge, look for a big, flat-topped rock below you to the left, especially if you hear a high pitched whistle. More than a few hikers have reports and photos of the marmot who favors that spot and has become referred to as the Greeter of Green Mountain.In the late fall and early winter, snow is likely present toward the top, and you will want traction devices (preferably something like micro-spikes) for the steep upper slopes. Use caution here as the drop-off in both directions is worthy of respect in slippery conditions. This is not a suitable destination after significant snowfall; all those treeless, gorgeous meadows are otherwise known as avalanche slopes.Once at the lookout, the views are world class. Mount Baker is visible to the north, Buckindy, the Ptarmigan Traverse group, and Dome Peak rise above the Downey Creek valley to the east, with the top of pointy Mount Sinister peeking out behind Dome. Glacier Peak dominates the southern skyline just west of the Suiattle River valley, along with the usual Mountain Loop suspects: Mount Pugh, Sloan Peak, Del Campo, Three Fingers, White Chuck and White Horse.WTA Pro Tip: Traveling to 6500 feet on mostly exposed slopes warrants more attention to packing than many other similarly proportioned dayhikes might. Bring lots of water, especially in the summer (all the more if traveling with a dog), wear base layers you can strip down to if it's hot but pack something windproof and something warm and puffy if it's cold up high. In the summer you will want bug spray, and on any sunny day, sunscreen and lip balm should be on hand. Don't forget your dog's nose and upright ears, though check the ingredients: zinc oxide is toxic to dogs. Leave time for berry picking if they're in season and more for photo taking. Bring a headlamp. For a unique place to eat on the way home, consider Rhodes River Ranch in Oso just a few minutes off of Highway 530, where they range from the usual bar foods to the highbrow, have good salads and real-deal meat and potatoes (the meatloaf is awesome), as well as beer, wine, and desserts in a restaurant situated over a working, indoor horse arena.LEARN MORE: Suiattle Road Construction Blog:http://www.wta.org/signpost/suiattle-river-road-to-close-after-labor-daySaving the Green Mountain Lookout:http://www.wta.org/signpost/saving-green-mountain-lookout-a-retrospectiveMeet the HardGuys who maintained the lookout when there was no road and see the Greeter of Green Mountain:http://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report.2011-09-12.2632613751"

These range from paved and flat to rougher, dirt trails that are somewhat steep in places. All afford nice exercise and views from the valley of the high peaks above the wide Columbia River. There are four separate trails, with an additional very short loop perfect for the littlest hikers. The downtown station area is the heart of the system, where most trails begin and end. Stop here first to get a map (or at least a picture of the main one) before heading off. The Hamilton Creek Trail is a 1.25 mile long loop that offers a short tour of the western neighborhood of North Bonneville. Heading west from the downtown station, follow small circular discs printed with ""Hamilton Creek Trail"". These are posted on lampposts, but if you lose sight of these, faint blue footprints and arrows point the way. You'll cross a large bridge over Hamilton Creek, and shortly after crossing the salmon-bearing creek, get a short peek at the golf course before Hamilton Mountain dominates the horizon. From the mountain view, the trail begins to meander through back and front yards. Please respect the inhabitants by staying on the trail. Turning south, Hamilton Mountain recedes into the background. A fence appears to your right, marking the border between North Bonneville and Pierce National Wildlife Refuge. The refuge is closed to the public except for guided tours or research, but it provides a pretty backdrop as you walk towards the river. A bench along the way provides a rest stop if needed. The rest of the trail parallels the river -- though you won't be able to see it -- before turning back into the Downtown Station. Another loop option is the Strawberry Island Trail. 1.5 miles long, it extends south past the city ball fields up onto Strawberry Island. The trail travels through beautiful mature oak forests and extensive grasslands out to a point above the mouth of Hamilton Creek where you can see Pierce and Ives Islands, as well as Beacon Rock. This trail is primarily grass track and transits both flat and hilly terrain. The tread of the Strawberry Island trail can be rougher and the trail itself is fainter. Consult the map often to be sure you're on the right track. A third option is the Columbia Trail. At about 2.5 miles long, this trail heads east through the Fort Cascades Historic Site. This trail offers views of Bonneville Dam and travels through a Douglas-fir and Oregon white oak forest. If you are lucky, you may glimpse some elk on this route, but visit early in the morning for wildlife shots. At the Fort Cascades trailhead, interpretive signs and a brochure tell the historic events of the Lower Cascades of the Columbia River, including what this area looked like before the Columbia was dammed and the people living along the river displaced.Finally, the Greenleaf Trail is a 2 mile trail on the north side of Highway 14. This traverses east along sparkling Greenleaf Lake to the east, highlighting the Pioneer Cemetery and the history of the Native Americans in the area. The loop also passes the popular Bonneville Hot Springs Resort."

The unassuming parking area for West Hylebos Wetlands is a gateway to a surprisingly rich, diverse, and lush wetland. Walk down the wide graveled path past two restored cabins, the Denny and Barker cabins. The Barker cabin is the oldest structure in Federal Way -- Barker was one of the first settlers here and he lived on these wetlands with four other settler families. Near the trailhead, the land is open and parklike. An informational kiosk greets visitors just a few hundred feet from the parking area, and the path wends around a large hedge, introducing you to a much more wooded, protected environment. Shortly after passing the kiosk, a trail to the right indicates the Marlake Loop. This is a short, muddy trail to a small lake adjacent to private property. It's a somewhat underwhelming trail; the good stuff further into the wetland, so stay to the left. Proceed down the wider trail and into the forest. Giant redcedars, hemlocks, and Douglas fir trees dripping with moss surround you, and soon the trail changes from gravel to boardwalk. In winter or rainy periods, the boardwalk can be slippery, so having good grips on your shoes or a walking stick will help here. Interpretive signs periodically inform the visitor what flora and fauna surrounds the boardwalk. Stop and discover what salal is, which tree towers over you, and what birds you can hear chirping overhead. A quarter mile from the trailhead arrive at a second junction. Here, each way leads to lovely, calm Brooklake, but the left route is longer (0.5 miles) compared to the 0.25 mile right route. The longer way takes visitors past a huge Sitka spruce tree and 'Deep Sink', one of a very few remaining peat bogs in the area. These are valuable from an environmental and educational perspective. It's worth taking the long way 'round.Your destination is a quiet place to sit on a bench and contemplate the silence of the lake before heading back. Luckily, this trail loops, so you can take the shorter way back to your car. When you make for the trailhead, follow the trail straight ahead rather than turning right when you head back to the lot."

The nearby town of Raymond is notable for being one of the rainiest in the state, with 83 inches of precipitation reported annually. That makes the perfect habitat for plants and animals that like it as wet as possible -- and these thrive at Preacher's Slough on the Chehalis River Surge Plain. The 3,018-acre wetland spreads out near the mouth of the Chehalis River, where it mingles with the saltwater of Grays Harbor and creates a nutrient-rich environment. Sitka spruce and western redcedar thrive here, though there are also beech trees lining the trail. As you hike, interpretive signs are tucked among the trees, offering information about salmon habitat, the history of the area (including how Preacher's Slough got its name), and why the railroad no longer runs on this side of the slough. Because of its rich habitat for fish, the surge plain also provides a good home for osprey and bald eagles.Walking along the trail, visitors are accompanied by traffic noise periodically, as it closely parallels the access road. It's three and a half miles to Blue Slough, another parking area with room for about seven cars and a boat launch. The seven mile round trip hike is a good workout, despite being rather flat, but if you don't feel like doing the whole route, a good turnaround point is the bench and overlook, indicated by a green sign on the righthand side of the trail.WTA Pro Tip: DNR has posted a warning about the presence of New Zealand Mudsnails in the slough.

In 1841, explorer Charles Wilkes was disappointed to discover that what he thought might be a deepwater anchorage just off shore was nothing but shallow mud. He dubbed the area, somewhat petulantly, Point No Point. Just a few years later, the point played a part in ending the American Indian wars. In 1855, leaders of the S'Klallam Native American tribes, as well as those from the Chimacum and Skokomish tribes, signed the Point No Point Treaty with Governor Isaac Stevens. The treaty ceded land to the United States from the crest of the Olympics to Puget Sound and designated reservations for the tribes. A rock mounted with a plaque and placed just outside the lighthouse is testament to this treaty. Shortly after the treaty's signing, construction began on a lighthouse at the end of the point. Since its completion in 1879, it has operated continuously, guiding vessels of all sorts around the land it occupies, and the shallow waters surrounding it. It is the oldest still operating lighthouse on Puget Sound. With 3 acres in the Point No Point County Park and one hiking trail, the Point No Point lighthouse makes a great destination for visitors young and old.

Its easily accessible location and fairly flat riverside route make it a perfect early-spring hike. Throw in a few waterfalls, wildflowers and a variety of ancient forest pecularities — including pinesap, coralroot and gnome plant—and you have an outdoor discovery destination suitable for the whole family, even Fido. The Lower Lewis River Falls are spectacular. At 43 feet high and 200 feet across, they are larger in person than photos may lead you to believe. On the left side is a churning trough which gathers most of the water flow, and  there are several viewpoints to capture the scene from. Look for carpets of vanilla-leaf here and there, and the bright white blooms of early season trillium swaying to and fro. Notice the gigantic stumps where giants once stood, the almost spongy wood a brilliant reddish color against the greens of the forest. Another mile and a half upstream lie the Middle Lewis River Falls, a river-width combination of a waterfall and a cascade sheeting along bedrock. The viewpoints are limited here, but even the riverbed is pretty, the clarity of the water revealing its ragged volcanic nature. A short side trail up to Lower Copper Creek Falls brings hikers to a small trickle of water that drops 32 feet in a classic formation.Continuing upstream, the forest becomes sprinkled with a smaller mix of trees. You will shortly arrive at the very impressive Upper Lewis River Falls. Again, photographs do not do this area justice. The falls are 58 feet high and 175 feet across. Have lunch at the river's edge below the falls and enjoy the view, as well as the cool breeze drifting off of the moving water.Taitnapum Falls lies a short distance further up the trail, so curious hikers can continue on. But a surprise waits for you before reaching Taitnapum; about a quarter mile beyond the lower viewpoint is another viewpoint of the Upper Lewis River Falls. It requires a steep uphill climb, but is worth the effort.Taitnapum Falls drops only 16 feet across the 60 foot width of the river. Its most noteworthy feature is the raggedness of its lip. Most waterfalls course over a well-rounded lip, but not Taitnapum. Its lip has resisted wearing evenly, leaving a bizarre ragged undercut edge for the water to spill over.Turn around here, or continue the remaining one third of a mile to the Quartz Creek Trailhead, where you can embark on another adventure, or turn around and head back to your starting point at the Lower Falls Recreation Area.WTA Pro Tip: There are multiple access points to the 14-mile long Lewis River Trail.

As hikers, we get to see their efforts up close. Snow Mountain Ranch offers a variety of summer and winter walks on 9.2 miles of trails. Relics of the old cattle ranch still remind hikers of the past on this 1,800-acre property. The ranch was home to Elon and Joan Gilbert, friends of Justice William O. Douglas, whom he would often stop to visit on his way into the Cascades from his home in Yakima. History is just one of many attractions at Snow Mountain Ranch. Hike the riparian areas for a chance to glimpse great horned owls, or focus your binoculars on the local pond for sightings of a variety of ducks. The lowland fields provide excellent hunting grounds for red-tailed hawks, sharp shinned hawks and northern harriers. There is also a resident population of elk that wander in and out of ranch area. Deer and coyote signs are apparent on all trails. Hike to the top of Cowich Mountain for views westward of Mount Adams and Mount Rainier, and a large elk feeding station managed by WDFW. To the east Yakima is visible. In winter, snowshoes are not usually required, but traction devices can come in handy when trails are icy.To hike the 7-mile roundtrip Cowiche Mountain Trail, depart from the Snow Mountain Ranch parking lot, and take the Entry Trail to the main kiosk, where you can pick up a brochure with a trail map. From here, cross the bottomlands to the mouth of a ravine and another trail junction. Turn left and climb a short hill to the beginning of the aptly named Wildflower Trail. This trail climbs 1 mile south along the benchlands above the ravine to a junction with the Bench Loop Trail and a connection with the west leg of the Cowiche Mountain Loop Trail. Continue heading upward, south, then east, on a fairly direct line with the 2,970 summit and a junction with the east leg of the Cowiche Mountain Trail and Rocky Top Trails. Along the way, the views expand with every step, and much of the trail is lined with wildflowers: grass widows and desert-parsleys early in the season followed by balsamroot, lupine, phlox and fields of big-headed clover. You'll also pass two old bathtubs used as stock watering troughs when this was a working ranch. Once on the summit, kick back, bask in the sun and enjoy the panoramic views of the surrounding countryside. When it’s time to return, descend the way you came or make it a loop by descending on the east leg of the Cowiche Mountain Trail."

Named for the rivers of rocky lava that surround the trail, the 10.8-mile Worm Flows route ascends nearly 5,700 feet to the summit of Mount St. Helens. Although challenging, this standard winter and spring route provides a non-technical climb for experienced hikers craving sweet summit views and a chance to practice basic mountaineering skills.Start at the Marble Mountain Sno Park. Cross to the west side of Swift Creek, just above Chocolate Falls (elev. 3,700'). Follow ridges and open slopes to the crater rim. Wooden route marking posts guide climbers from timberline to approximately 4,800' elevation. About 2 miles in, leave the forest and pass views of Chocolate Falls, a 40-foot waterfall along Swift Creek, heading into a barren landscape of mudflows and rock, where large posts and occasional cairns mark the way.

But you're not finished yet. Head west along the rim to the true summit, a mound of rocks at 8,365 feet. Savor more sweet views before turning around for the return trip back to the trailhead.Hike safely - to reduce your exposure to avalanche potential, stay away from snow loaded slopes and gully bottoms. Stay off the cornices at the crater rim.WTA Pro Tip: Winter climbers can self-issue their permits at the Climber's Bivouac trailhead. No fee is required for permits between November 1 and March 31.

You get to go up, over and around mogul-like mounds peppered with volcanic rock, explore the upper rim of Coyote Wall, and descend a grassy slope with uninterrupted views of the Colombia River Gorge. In the spring there is a steady progression of wildflowers, making this an especially good early-season hike.This loop hike begins with Coyote Wall towering above you as you walk down an abandoned highway. Coyote Wall is a 200-foot cliff of columnar basalt that was formed as the ancient Missoula floods swept through the Columbia River Basin. The uphill portion of this hike is on the Little Moab trail (CO3).  On the first half of the Little Moab you get to climb through an area of grass-covered hills, exposed bedrock, lichen-covered volcanic rocks, and the occasional ponderosa pine. The second half parallels the rim of Coyote Wall, giving you close-up views of basalt cliffs with multiple opportunities to peer down from the top. The downhill portion of this hike is on the Little Maui (CO5) trail, which meanders down a grassy slope dotted with white oaks and then descends along a stream with several waterfalls. The Little Maui trail provides postcard-perfect views of the hills above Labyrinth Creek to the east and the Colombia River to the south. The hike ends with a short walk on the old highway back to the trailhead.  Begin this hike by parking at the Coyote Wall Trailhead near the intersection of Courtney Rd. and Hwy 14. From the parking area head east on the old, abandoned pavement as it scoots around the cliff.After 0.5 miles, you will come to dirt trail on the left side of the old pavement. This dirt track is the ""Old Ranch Road"". Follow it as it switches back uphill (avoid the many user-created shortcuts). Shortly after the first switchback turn, you will come to a trail junction. Keep to the left and continue uphill on the ""Old Ranch Road"". After going over two areas of exposed bedrock, you will come to a second trail junction. Again, go to the left and continue uphill 0.3 miles until you come to the Little Moab Trail (CO3). There are some particularly nice views of the Colombia River through this section, so have your camera ready.When you come to the junction with the Little Moab trail, go to the left and follow the trail towards the top of Coyote Wall. This part of the hike may bring out your inner child as you wind through grassy mounds, climb up exposed bedrock, and skirt rocky outcroppings. In 0.3 miles, you will come to your first view of Coyote Wall from the top and another trail junction. Stay left and follow the Little Moab Trail along the upper edge of Coyote Wall where you will have multiple opportunities to view the rocky cliffs that make the wall. After 0.4 miles, the trail breaks out into an open grassy area and comes to the intersection with an old jeep road (CO4) just downhill from a photo-ready barbwire fence. You will turn left on the old jeep road for this hike, but first it is well worth going through the gap in the fence and taking the trail on the left to a viewpoint at the top of wall. With views of the Coyote Wall, Mt. Hood, and the Colombia River Gorge, this makes a good spot for a break.After enjoying the view, go back through the fence and follow the old jeep road east 0.2 miles to the Little Maui trail (CO3). At this junction, the jeep road takes a sharp turn to the right while the Little Maui trail takes off to the left. Go left and begin your descent down the Little Maui trail. The first part of the trail follows a serpentine path through grassy plateaus dotted with solitary white oaks. You can see the hills and rocky outcroppings above Labyrinth Creek to the east, the Colombia River to the South, and wildflower during the spring. The second part of the trail takes you along a stream with small cascading waterfalls. In 0.9 miles, you will come to a junction with a trail going to the left. Keep going straight to stay on the Little Maui Trail. After another 0.1 miles the Little Maui trail joins the ""Old Ranch Road"". Turn left and follow the road downhill.  Near the bottom you will encounter a maze of trails with several options for returning to the old highway.  Keep on an established trail and watch out for mountain bikers. After reaching the old highway, turn right to return to your car. CAUTION: You may encounter poison oak on this hike. Know what it looks like and watch what you touch.WTA Pro Tip: A perfect way to end your Coyote Wall experience is to stop in Stevenson Washington for a snack or dinner at the Walking Man Brewery or the Big River Grill.The Walking Man Brewery serves a wide variety of their own brews along with sandwiches and gourmet pizzas (these are especially good). Plus, the outdoor seating area allows you to continue your commune with nature.  This is odd advice, but be sure to check out the décor of the restrooms.If you’d like a more upscale dining experience, go to the Big River Grill which features Northwest Cuisine using fresh local ingredients.  With its license plate collection and Columbia River sturgeon mermaid, the food is Portland-good and the atmosphere roadhouse quirky."

The Columbia Springs Environmental Education Center has three main trails that range from 1/16 of a mile long, to 1/3 of a mile. The Hemlock Trail, found at the east end of the park, is the shortest, but arguably has the best diversity of scenery. Coming from the parking area, the full walk may be closer to 1/8 of a mile, but on the way, you'll pass the fish rearing ponds, including one where you can feed young rainbow and brown trout. Past the ponds is a short walk to the Cordwood Classroom. The trail begins just behind the classroom, but before you head there, go to the viewing area over West Biddle Pond. On sunny days, young trout can be seen warming themselves here. How many can you count? After watching the fish for a while, head behind the Cordwood classroom, where you'll see the Hemlock Trail heading off to the right. Stairs carry you down, just above thick groundcover and along the north side of West Biddle Pond. Climb back up on both stairs and trail, to a fork. The right hand trail loops back to the viewing platform for the 1/16 mile loop, but a very short side trail heads through an open grassy space and ends at a viewing platform over quieter East Biddle Lake. If it's a longer loop you're after, from the parking lot try either the Cedar Circle Trail or the slightly shorter Trillium Trail. Both are accessible from the west side of the parking area, though to reach the Cedar Circle Trail, you'll need to walk west on the sidewalk away from the parking area, looking for an unsigned trail on your right. Both trails go through thick understory and soaring deciduous canopy. Look for trillium at your feet, and various leaves and blooms above your head as you hike. Both of these trails loop around themselves and deliver you back to the parking area in less than a mile. Though the trails are not ADA-accessible, they are friendly to just about every other ability of hiker, and Columbia Springs is free and open to the public from dawn to dusk each day."

And that's saying something, since the Oregon side of the Gorge flows with more than 70 cascades of varying heights. Of course, all that flowing water has made it famous, and its proximity to Portland and Vancouver mean Multnomah is one of the most crowded of these waterfalls as well.More than 2 million visitors flock to these falls every year. On a busy weekend, expect to see hundreds of your fellow hikers, not to mention family outings, tourists, even wedding parties, since the historic Benson Bridge across the upper splash pool is a favorite location for wedding photos, despite a handful of incidents in which rocks have come over the edge of the falls and crashed into the pool below. While quite rare, the effects of these exciting incidents range from thorough soakings of the wedding party to significant chunks being taken out of the bridge itself.The hiking options here vary greatly. If you want an easy day, you can snap a few photos from the base of the falls, check out the informational kiosk at the base of the falls, then toddle to the gift shop/cafe for an ice cream cone. Or you can head up to Benson Bridge for a closer view of the waterfall. For a short, but rigorous hike, it's less than a mile to the overlook at the top of the falls, but be warned that the route is often crowded and always steep. While the trail is quite wide, it is not ADA-accessible because of the grade. Mud near the top of the trail can also pose a bit of a threat--be careful at that overlook!On the way to the top, you'll hike through lush forest with ferns and moss growing on all sides. Maple and alder trees mix with Douglas-fir and redcedar and add a splash of color in the autumn. Wildflowers like False Solomon's Seal, foamflower, violets, and many others line the trail in spring. Multnomah Falls is spectacular year round, but go in winter or early spring to see the highest water flow."

Originally a pond, the lake was dammed in the early 1900s. You'll actually cross over the dam at the north end of the lake on your hike. In 1921, a portion of the dam gave way, and the waters of the lake poured northward into the bay, temporarily trapping workers in shoreline canneries.With ten different access points in the neighborhoods surrounding Little Cranberry Lake, this destination is a great option for people living in or visiting friends in Anacortes. The trailhead accessible via the graveled Cranberry Lake Road has room for 15 to 20 cars, and its proximity to benches and views of the lake make it a great option for picnickers. A trailhead kiosk holds a trail map, but you can buy ACFL maps at the parks department, the Anacortes visitors center or at several local stores, and you definitely need one to navigate the network of trails that crisscross this park.It is possible to do a 1.73 mile loop around the lake, but note that the trail on the east side of the lake is quite close to the water—in some places footing is tricky, and it may not be a great option for those with small children. However, there are plenty of lakeside spots near the north end of the lake that make great destinations for families and little explorers. If it’s a loop you want, and you're confident in your footing, follow Trail 100 over the spillway near the parking lot and past the deck, stopping to snap a picture of the lake from the wooden overlook. Continue on Trail 100 around a small inlet full of logs, then turn left and uphill onto Trail 103. Switchback up and then traverse this trail for a half mile, passing through madronas and cedars along a ridgeline above the lake. Once there was a view of the lake here, but the trees have grown up enough that your first good views only come on your descent. Once you reach a junction, turn right, and at a “T” intersection at the lakeshore, turn left, following a bridge over a swampy area on Trail 132. This is the connection between Little Cranberry Lake and Big Beaver Pond. Once over the bridge, the trail becomes slightly more rugged, dipping very near the lake at points and becoming more brushy than it has been so far. Hike along Trail 132 and then bear right onto Trail 101, which stays close to the west side of the lake. The quality of trail improves as you near the north end of the lake. Picnic opportunities abound here, with slabs of rock and moss providing good places to rest, recline and take in the views under bright madrone trees. After hiking a little more than a half-mile, find yourself back at the parking lot, and your car. The trail is edged with salal and mixed second-growth forest.

As with many “lakeshore” trails, the trail is not actually near the lakeshore.  While the lake is generally out of sight, it does allow the possibility of a hike/canoe biathlon, if you can find a partner with a canoe.  Wynoochee Lake is smaller and calmer than some of the lakes in Washington, making this a nice option.The trail starts near the day use area at the north end of the beach (up-lake from the dam).  Pass several social trails as you make your way through the campground.  These paths head to campsites or to the water, and there is little doubt which trail is the main trail.  Soon you’ll come to a couple of junctions with other trails, but these are well signed.  The first one you’ll see is the Working Forest Nature Trail on your left.  The next one you’ll see is the Chetwoot Campground on your right.  Avoid both of these and stay on the lakeshore trail.The trail crosses a couple of small creeks, losing and gaining elevation each time.  The creeks are pretty small, but could result in wet feet in the early season.  In July, look for foxglove at these crossings, a tall plant with pink flowers.  At the north end of the lake you’ll have a choice – you can attempt a ford of Wynoochee River, or you can continue along the trail for another 2 miles to a good bridge overlooking Maidenhair falls.  This choice is also an opportunity to do a one-way hike and take an alternate form of transportation back.  If you have friends with the canoe, arrange to meet them on the river.  If you’re traveling with companions of varying hiking abilities, arrange to meet them at Maidenhair falls with the car.  Maidenhair Falls and the accompanying gorge is a mere half mile from its trailhead and is a worthwhile destination for waterfall lovers.For those who prefer a long walk, the trail continues along the east side of the lake.  The loop around the lake is 12-16 miles, depending on whether a ford of the Wynoochee River is safe.  At the southern end of the lake, cross the Wynoochee River Gorge on the road bridge."

From the high peaks on either side of the pass, verdant meadows curve down to a saddle that offers sweeping views of nearby valleys, glaciers, mountains, and passing wildlife. Sedately climbing a little less than 1,800 feet in 3.6 miles, it is the perfect hike to show new hikers the extraordinary places their feet can take them. The epic scenery begins before you even hit the trail. The unpaved section of Cascade River Road skirts massive old growth trees on the way to the circular parking lot tucked underneath Johannesburg Mountain, towering more than 4,000 feet overhead. As you travel through the 30-some switchbacks that define the first 2.7 miles of trail, Johannesburg (a malapropism of the nearby Johnsberg mining claim) continues to make its presence felt, even when barely visible through the trees. On warm days, snow and ice from its hanging glaciers break loose and boom down the mountainside. Once you round the final switchback, you have one mile to go, proceeding more or less straight for the pass. The trees grow steadily thinner as you reach open slopes and the pass comes into view. After crossing a long rockfield, the trail makes a few final bends and arrives at the pass, where a post marked for Stehekin points the way into the lush valley below. But don't be fooled -- the little community of Stehekin lies at the head of Lake Chelan, nearly thirty miles from where you currently stand.Cascade Pass offers views of several impressive peaks and glaciers. The ridge from Johannesburg Mountain connects to Mixup Peak and Magic Mountain, in between which lies the Cache Glacier. Back the way you came, the horizon is comprised largely of the glacier-dotted lower slopes and snowy summit arête of El Dorado Peak. Nearer by, you may very well be treated to views of wildlife. In addition to the local population of marmots and pika, the occasional deer, mountain goat, or bear may wander through on the way to and from steeper, rockier places or the wildflower and blueberry fields just above and beyond the pass. We humans have likewise been using Cascade Pass as a crossroads for thousands of years, and today it is still not at all the end of the trail. From here, the trail to Stehekin continues east through the abandoned mining claims of Horseshoe Basin. To the north, a trail continues to Sahale Arm. To the south, a backcountry high route known as the Ptarmigan Traverse marches up the slopes of Mixup Peak and disappears over the ridge. One trip here, though, and you may rightfully conclude that it is a spectacular destination in its own right. WTA Pro-Tip: Only you can fight chipmunk obesity! The steady stream of visitors to the pass has created a population of corpulent chipmunks. Respect Leave No Trace principles and guard your crumbs jealously to help the chipmunks return to a more natural diet."

All that marks the trailhead is a metal gate and a place to pull over and park.Beginning on an abandoned road, a visible but overgrown path leads along the road to where the trail begins.

After the road walk, the true trail begins on a bench high above the river. The tread has been recently rebenched, thanks to volunteer efforts. The trail meanders down to the river, and some tread had been restored.This new trail is a nice alternative to the hiker hordes on the Cascade Pass trail. The scenery is not as large scale grand, but it is a beautiful trail with mountain views and a destination lunch spot by the river. The trail that once was on the other side of the river had been deemed too dangerous, due to dead standing timber, for volunteer groups to work in, so it may be a while before it is restored to its former status."

Despite the 360-degree views of the North Cascades to be had from its namesake fire lookout, it can scarcely compete with nearby hikes like Hidden Lake Peaks and Cascade Pass. Legions of hikers race right past on Cascade River Road, leaving Lookout Mountain with a fraction of the crowds of those other trails. It almost isn’t fair. If you decide to take advantage of its relatively solitary vantage, be prepared for a long climb that guards its views jealously. The trail is almost entirely in trees, and when you do finally leave the forest behind, you are in for a cruel tease. The trail comes within 500 feet of the summit as the crow flies. The end of the trail looks so close you could touch it, but a steep dropoff between you and the top of the mountain leaves you with another half mile to go. It’s the last leg of a 4,500-foot climb that plays out over 4.7 miles. The trail starts from a small pullout seven miles up Cascade River Road. It immediately begins climbing, and climb is all it does for a long while, with little but switchbacks and sweat to mark the passing miles. The first milestone comes in the form of creek crossings two and a half miles in. In another third of a mile, you reach a trail junction--the fork to the right leads to Monogram Lake, more than a mile away. In roughly another half of a mile, the trail finally leaves the trees and begins traversing a rocky meadow on its way to the spot described above. The summit looks deceptively close at hand. The trail instead heads southwest and completes a series of long switchbacks before seeming to disappear in a dense stand of hemlock. Just beyond lies a sweeping southerly vista followed by a turn back to towards the north. You’re on final approach--up the ridge, straight to the summit. The summit is, of course, crowned by the fire lookout, bearing the circular name of Lookout Mountain Lookout. The current tower is a 1960’s remodel that replaced the original structure from the 1920’s. It is open to the public and contains a small exhibit of historic lookout gear. From its wraparound deck, you will quickly understand why it was built here. It provides sweeping views that take in the full breadth of the North Cascades, starting with Mount Baker and Mount Shuksan and continuing to Eldorado Peak and the glaciers of Boston Basin. Odds are good – even on a nice day – that you’ll have a chance to enjoy them in peace and quiet."

The flows began some 9000 years ago and, as Mount St. Helens showed, volcanic activity in the area is still occurring. The Big Lava Bed is a volcanic formation, but it's not the classic conical volcano. Rather, it is a 20-square-mile flow of basalt that flowed out of a source vent found in the north-central part of the bed, just south of Goose Lake.Spindly pines cover much of the Big Lava Bed, giving it the appearance of a gentle, young forest from a distance. Get near the lava, though, and the truth comes out: There is nothing gentle about this landscape. The PCT skirts the west side of the basalt field, and almost immediately after starting the hike, the harsh nature of the lava bed is nakedly evident. Step off the trail, and the landscape is nearly impassable. The lava is abrasive, brittle, and very unstable. Try to scramble to the top of one of the short lava knobs scattered around the area, and you'll find your leather boots not just scuffed but slashed and cut to ribbons. Better to enjoy the rugged beauty of the lava flow from the relative safety of the trail.The trail leaves the horse camp and within the first 0.25 mile meets the lava flows. The trail then rolls with the flow, as it were, skirting the rough lava on its western flank. To the west of the trail is an open pine forest scarred with clear-cuts, but the buffer of trees along the trail block most of that logging damage from view. Besides, the lava beds will keep your eyes turned away from the other side of the trail.The terrain in the Big Lava Bed is a jumble of rock. Huge blocks of lava, towering up like black cotton-candy tufts, dot the landscape. Many of these are pahoehoe formations-wrinkled masses of rock formed by fast-moving lava. Pahoehoe is easy to identify: just look for the rocks that remind you of shar-pei dogs, a solid mass of ropey folds and wrinkles. Between the great tufts of lava are fissures, crevices, pressure ridges, and fields of sharp, jagged black basalt. The trail follows alongside this world of volcanic turmoil for nearly 3 miles before edging away from the lava into a calmer world of pine forests. The trail rolls gently through the forest for another 3.5 miles to the southeast flank of Big Huckleberry Mountain. For a full day of hiking, turn around where the trail leaves the lava for a short outing over to Big Huckleberry Mountain. Take note that the mountain is aptly named-in late summer the area around the mountain is flush with marble-sized purple fruit. There is no path to the mountain's forested top, so stick to the sun-dappled clearings along the trail."

Hike to one of the pleasant viewpoints along the way, to Rattlesnake Mountain, or do a traverse all the way to Rattlesnake Lake, clocking in at 11 miles. The views are some of the best in the Cascade foothills and the trail can be hiked year-round, though it can be snowy in winter.The trail was officially dedicated in June 2007, though people had hiked this route using a mix of trail and logging roads for years before. Now the trail winds its way through mostly second-growth forest, crossing a few logging roads and requiring just a few stints on old roads. The trail follows I-90 fairly closely, but there are times you don't remember it's just out of sight. Still, the reality of being in a managed forest does appear as some sections wend through clearcuts. Fortunately, the forest canopy gets more mature towards the higher points, and there is a delightful progression of ecosystems along the way.The first nice viewpoint is Stan's Overlook, about 2.5 miles in. Pass under some powerlines and continue gradually upward another third of a mile to an obvious signed trail to the left. Stan's Overlook has a picnic table and two benches. From there you can see Mount Si and the Snoqualmie Valley. Next up, and a fine turn-around for those not traveling end-to-end, is Grand Prospect about 4.9 miles from your starting point. This precipice is due south of the town of North Bend.Six miles from the trailhead and 3500 feet high is East Peak, featuring great views, including Rainier on a good day.

In addition to the Bluff Trail, visitors can experience the seaport town of Coupeville, observe working farms, and get their fill of wildlife viewing, all in a tiny National Park on Whidbey Island.There are two ways to access the Bluff Trail – either from the Prairie Overlook trailhead across the road from Sunnyside Cemetery, or from the seaside parking lot at the end of Ebey’s Landing Road. Hikers who want to enjoy a short beachside ramble would do well to begin at the parking lot off Ebey’s Landing Road, while those who want a bit more of a hike should start from the Prairie Overlook. Keep in mind that both routes do take hikers through private property, so be respectful of property lines. From the Prairie Overlook Trailhead, take a moment to enjoy the view laid out in front of you. Mount Baker rests on the horizon to the east and other Cascade peaks march away to the south. To the west, the Olympics loom large over Puget Sound. Take the view in, then take a narrow, brushy, but thankfully short access trail to a wide graveled road. A sign here points west, leading the way to the Bluff Trail. Stay on the clearly marked route, walking past fields of wheat along the road. The way becomes more rugged as you head due west, changing from gravel to dirt, drawing you ever closer to the coast. Soon arrive at a ‘T’ junction, where you can follow the trail either right or left. Take a right and head up a somewhat steep, but very short hill to a summit with a beautiful view of the beach below. From here, traverse along the bluff, enjoying the wildflowers on the slope to your left and the windswept trees to your right. The trail gradually descends along the bluff, offering an ever-changing perspective of the lagoon below, a birdwatchers haven. Hike until you come to a switchback, and descend steeply through several switchbacks to the beach. Ramble south along the beach until you arrive at the junction with the Ebey’s Landing parking lot. Restrooms and informative brochures are available here, and note that if you start from this parking lot, a Discover Pass is required. Take a moment to learn about the history of the area before climbing two sets of stairs back up to the prairie. Head north along the prairie to the junction you started at, and the turn right to return to the Prairie Overlook parking lot the same way you came. Be aware that there are stinging nettles on the brushy access trail on your return to the car – long pants and keeping an eye out will help prevent irritation from these little guys. WTA Pro Tip: Be sure to stop at Kapaws Iskreme on Front Street in Coupeville on the way back from your hike. This quaint ice cream shop is generous in their portions, and it’s delightful to walk down to the wharf with your cone to see more beautiful views of Mount Baker."

This route explores the sparse pine forests flanking the edge of that massive ancient river of molten rock that is the Aiken Lava Bed. Though the magma no longer flows, hike here in August and you'll get a sense of the heat that must have been thrown off by the molten flow-the hot August sun bakes that black basalt rock until the ambient air around the lava bed can easily climb 10 to 20 degrees hotter than that of the surrounding forestlands. That means a 90-degree summer day can be 110 degrees Fahrenheit on the rocks!Hike north from the trailhead along Gotchen Creek Trail (No. 11), hugging the eastern edge of the tall, jagged ridge of black basalt that is the Aiken Lava Bed. The trail stays well under the forest canopy most of the way, but during the heat of summer the black rocks of the lava bed throw a lot of heat back down into the forest, so pack plenty of water, though you'll have access to Gotchen Creek, too.As you skirt the lava bed, you'll be tempted to scramble up the lava walls. Be careful if you do- the rock is loose, sharp, and brittle. It can roll, break, and slash with little encouragement.The trail climbs steadily from the get-go, cutting first through thick, cool forest and then into increasingly open, airy pine forests. Great fields of vanilla leaf bound the trail during the first 3 miles, and beargrass becomes common after that. At 3 miles (4800 feet) the trail passes a side trail leading east toward Snipes Mountain. From this point on, the forest becomes far more sparse, and meadows and forest clearings become common occurrences. These provide great views up onto the lava bed. About 5 miles in, the trail parallels the national forest boundary with the Yakama Indian Reservation to the east, and at 5.5 miles intersects the Round the Mountain Trail (No. 9) at 6300 feet.

Over the course of its 44 miles, it presents a virtual highlight reel of dry-side beauty, from sage-scented meadows to subalpine parkland.Located in the far northeast corner of the state, the Kettle Crest features a half-dozen of Eastern Washington’s highest peaks, some topping out at more than 7,000 feet. Nominally a ridge-running route, the Kettle Crest tallies up nearly 8,000 feet of cumulative elevation gain over its length. Yet there are no cloud-piercing spires here, just a mosaic of old-growth forests and open sagebrush meadows, from which shimmer distant vistas of the Cascade and Rocky Mountains.Owing to its diversity of habitats and lack of human development, the Kettle Range boasts some of the best remaining wildlife habitat in Eastern Washington. Hikers should keep their eyes peeled for cougar, moose, mule deer and black bear, all cruising the high country. But in summer, the dazzling array of wildflowers—buckwheat, lupine, aster, yarrow, paintbrush, hawkweed and others—will likely keep your attention focused on the foreground.From the southern trailhead, ascend through profuse wildflowers on White Mountain before beginning a view-packed stretch past Barnaby Buttes and Bald Mountain. The southwest slope of Snow Peak holds great camp spots near the shelter. Skirt Sherman Peak and Columbia Mountain, then traipse along a sagebrush lined ridge; camp sites are scattered along the way. The high point is 7,140-foot Copper Butte, where fragments of an old lookout remain. Descend through a ghost forest of snags and settle in for open grasslands and lupine-filled fir forest, all the way to the northern trailhead at Boulder Pass. This is one of the sections of the trail that creep under ghostly silver snags left standing from past wildfires, most notably the 1988 White Mountain Fire, which scorched more than 20,000 acres of the southern Kettles. In these sections, wildlife, wildflowers and wide-open views have taken the place of the trees, making this one of the scenic highlights of the region.Aside from a few wooded saddles, virtually the entire route offers up big views: to the south, the Colville Indian Reservation and northernmost reaches of the Columbia Plateau; to the west, the Okanogan Highlands and, beyond, the Cascades; to the north, the peaks of British Columbia; and to the east, Idaho’s Selkirks.To the Colville tribe, whose ancestral lands encompassed the Kettle Range, the mountains bear sacred significance. On White Mountain, near the southern terminus of the trail, hikers can inspect cairns built by young members of the tribe during vision quests. Subsequent generations of visitors have also fallen under the spell of the Kettles, and a dedicated group of local conservationists has spent the last 40 years pressing for a congressional designation of wilderness for the Kettle Crest.WTA Pro Tip: Tapped springs, never more than a half-dozen miles apart, can hydrate hikers who plan refills carefully. Keep in mind this is open rangeland, and cattle congregate around the springs, some of which have been maintained in less-than stellar fashion by grazing leaseholders. Filter all your water."

Occasionally they drop gigantic pinecones from high above, and while the resulting crash is startling, it is fun to watch.The trail is in excellent shape, and gets right down to business, starting off venturing through a close forest with very little understory, but lots of moss. As you climb, you move swiftly from one steep but well-designed switchback to another, and yet another, gaining a little under 3,000 feet in a little under 3 miles. While this can be draining, rewards await you at the top. Huckleberry bushes line the trail, and tired hikers can stop and munch on the sweet treats their their heart's content. After three miles, the trail reaches a ridgeline with a set of switchbacks heading up a rocky face. If you look to the east, some stellar views of the mountains can be seen, and on a clear day Glacier Peak graces hikers with an up-close and personal view.Once you've conquered the ridgeline, most of your climbing is over. The trail continues much more gently through sub-alpine flower meadows that glow with lupine when in season. Eventually, the trail drops to pretty but stagnant Virgin Lake. There is no inlet or outlet, so the water is entirely snowmelt and rainwater, and by late fall the water is more like a bog. Often, this is a breeding ground for frogs and salamanders, so keep your eyes peeled for plenty of amphibian friends.WTA trail crews have had backcountry response teams (BCRTs) working to improve this section of trail for three summers, but use caution in wet weather as small sections can still be muddy, rocky, rooty, and steep, dropping 600 feet in 0.6 miles. If you can tear your eyes away from the trail, the view will take your breath away. Across the valley is the foot of Columbia Peak, and ss you round the last point, beautiful Blanca Lake opens up in all her glory. The lake is framed to the north by the peaks of Monte Cristo, Columbia, and Keyes. More than a few hikers have been known to gasp aloud when they round the corner and see the robin-egg blue waters. Above the lake, the Columbia Glacier drains via a twin waterfall into the vibrantly blue colored water. It's the glacial till in the water that lends the lake its otherworldly color. At at the end of the trail lies a small beach full of driftwood, perfect for relaxing and enjoying the beauty that surrounds you. Here pikas and marmots abound, watching like sentinels from large boulders fallen from the peaks high above.WTA Pro Tip: Blanca Lake is an extremely popular trail.

With thirty structures on the 1.35 mile loop, you can be sure to have an intimate look at the workings of a wetland without getting damp yourself.Originally the site of nearly all of Olympia's drinking water, this small park now provides a site of retreat for residents. The city operated the waterworks here, and relics are still visible if visitors look carefully. The area was saved in 1955 by the citizens who opposed a logging operation slated for Watershed Park. The park also boasts the source of Moxlie Creek. This spring, officially named Moxlie Creek Springs Basin, is one of the largest in the region. This accounts for the remarkable wetness in the area -- springs creep and flow around fragrant skunk cabbage and venerable mossy-limbed branches, making its way around and about to create Moxlie Creek. Beginning from the G. Eldon Marshall Parking area, descend steeply to the quiet creek, finding a sign lauding the people who were instrumental in saving this haven of nature in the city. Hiking clockwise, the trail begins as a relatively flat one, meandering around and over roots and boggy areas. Where it is not made of wooden structures, the trail is graveled or dirt, but with one or two steep, narrow sections, this is not a place for strollers or wheelchairs. However, those able to navigate a trail by themselves or with a little assistance will love how close to nature this trail brings them. The way is well-signed, with trails branching off to various pedestrian entrances."

Take it a little slower and soak in the views by snowshoeing around a large lake rife with winter wildlife. With more than 13 kilometers of groomed nordic track, the trails here offer an all-day workout if that's what you seek. Shorter loops can be made of course,  and a seasonally established snowshoe trail provides a little more rugged route. Beginning from the Yurt, cross the groomed track and head toward the lake. Be sure to step over the nordic ski tracks, not in them, and look for cross-country skiers. Look for an orange diamond sign emblazoned with a black snowshoe -- these will be your markers as you make your way around the lake. The snowshoe track sticks close to the lakeside. Head east past your first marker, and begin your wending way along the side of the lake. The Lake Loop of the groomed trails parallels this track roughly, so you may see skiers to your right as you weave in and out of the forest on the edge of the delightfully named Leech Lake. At the northeast end of the lake, the groomed trail and snowshoe track meet up briefly to cross a bridge. Here you will see some interpretive signs telling you about the wildlife that can be found in the area. Continue across the bridge and look for the snowshoe track at the junction of two groomed trails. Here you have a decision. If you want to stick to the lake, it's about three-quarters of a mile along the track, and you'll simply continue across the bridge and look for the snowshoe route on your left past the bridge. If you want more of a workout, head up the hill at the intersection previously mentioned. You're heading on a steeper grade and a usually less-packed trail to Dog Lake and a small waterfall a little more than a half mile away. The trail becomes more forested as you had uphill. You'll cross three groomed trails along the way -- first the Corral Loop, where a summertime horse camp lies buried under snow. The second trail crossing is with the Deer Creek Loop -- an intermediate cross-country trail. Finally, arrive at your third trail junction, where four trails converge. To your left, The Hill ascends steeply, while straight ahead is the Biathlon Loop and to your right is the Dog Lake Loop. At the groomed trail, turn right and hike for a short distance on the edge (not in the center or on the ski tracks), looking for a trail disappearing into the woods on the opposite side of the road. Hop onto that trail, heading for those waterfalls! The grade is slightly shallower than what you've been on, and it wends and weaves through large trees and dormant creeks to a last junction. The falls are just down the spur trail to your left. After enjoying the falls, return to the trail and complete the loop by taking the trail you did not arrive by. This loops back around to the four-trail intersection, and you'll once again hike a short distance on the road to where the snowshoe track resumes. From here, you'll retrace your steps back to the lake and bridge, and look for another snowshoe track entrance on the near side of the bridge. Use this track to complete your circle of the lake and return to the yurt and parking lot."

This trail climbs slowly, passing a fragrant field of skunk cabbage as well as towering fir trees before arriving at a junction with Trail 6 after a mile and a half. Continue climbing, and cross a logging road, then enter a mature second-growth forest, the result of replanting from the visitors who were here in their log trucks years ago. From here, the trail descends into your first valley, Sherman Creek. 3.5 miles from the trailhead is the bottom of the valley, where another trail junction awaits you. Turn left on Trail 8, though a right turn leads to a lovely bridge over the creek, a worthy detour if you have time. Trail 8 leads along the valley bottom for three miles before arriving at yet another trail junction. Such is the nature of loops made from interwoven trails. Leave Sherman Creek and follow Lost Valley Creek, walking opposite its flow. Follow an old logging roadbed for a mile, looking here especially for logging relics.

Then it's more cascades, more rumbling, more climbing above the forbidding passages.At 2.5 miles cross the first of two large avalanche chutes. Despite the low elevation (1700 feet) snow often lingers late into the spring. At 3 miles find a steep side trail heading down to a secluded pool on the creek. The main trail continues through big timber, traverses an open flat, and then at 3.5 miles descends to Success Creek. Here at the confluence of Success and Graves Creeks, two fords must be made if you wish to continue. Day hikers will want to call it quits here.

The hospital was established in 1909 after the over-crowded conditions at Western State Hospital came under public criticism. Northern State’s grand opening happened in 1912. The Olmstead Brothers, whose father was famous for having designed New York City’s Central Park, designed the landscape at Northern State. Renowned architects Saunders and Lawton designed the hospital’s buildings. They worked in close collaboration with Northern State’s farm superintendent to create a self-sustaining and therapeutic colony for the mentally ill. The hospital site included patient and staff housing, a water reservoir, sewage system, lumber mill, quarry, steam plant, greenhouse, canning facilities, gymnasium, library, laundry, dining room, bakery, dairy, and 700-acre farm for growing vegetables and raising livestock. A cemetery was also included in the site plan.At one time in the 1950s about 2,700 patients lived at Northern State. This was the full capacity of the hospital according to the superintendent at the time, but he was still being pressured to take on more patients. The public perception of mental hospitals began to change in the 1970s, and Northern State Mental Hospital closed its doors in 1976 after the State Legislature cut off funding. Some of the buildings, including the farm’s housing ward, have since been torn down. A few of the remaining buildings are currently being used for job corps projects and drug rehabilitation.The active buildings at Northern State are off-limits to members of the public, but much of the former property is now a part of Northern State Recreation Area. It is located just north of the Skagit River near the town of Sedro-Woolley. The recreation area has an extensive trail system that will take you through wide open pastures, along forested lanes, and past the still standing barns, milking shed, cannery, and other structures used during the hospital’s self-sustaining past.

If you're looking for a more thorough exploration of the area, a 1.5-mile loop trail to the south wends among, around, and even over some of the mounds. As you hike, keep an eye out for the fluffy mosses and lichen, low-growing prairie grasses, and the charred remains of trees.

At 1.75 miles you'll approach a big landslide area (elev. 1900 ft). Scraped bare of vegetation, the slide is several hundred feet across and highly exposed. Trail tread is only a few inches wide in spots. Do not cross it if you are prone to vertigo or are the least bit uncomfortable. Instead, enjoy the limited views of Lake Crescent from this sunny spot. Those who do make the slide crossing will find no other obstacles along the way. Now in cool forest, the trail switchbacks and steadily climbs.At 2.75 miles reach the ridge crest and the edge of an old clear-cut, compliments of the Forest Service. They couldn't even leave a buffer along the park boundary. In 3 miles the trail comes on a logging road. The Forest Service, perhaps making amends for its ridgetop logging disgrace, is currently converting the road into trail. A final 0.5-mile push up a steep hillside of old-growth conifers is all that's keeping you from the 3000-foot summit.From the forested peak, scout out a ledge to peer 0.5 mile straight down to Lake Crescent. In the distance, Lake Sutherland and the Strait of Juan de Fuca can be seen. The old cabin was built in 1942 to spot enemy aircraft intent on reaching Puget Sound. It's one of only two that remain of the original thirteen that once sat on Olympic peaks during World War II. This hiker-historian would like to see it restored as a reminder and a memorial to our servicemen and women."

Take this trail. Once at the river, take the short spur trail to the right to Goblins Gate, a powerful place where the mighty Elwha slams into a canyon wall and makes a near-90-degree turn. Backtrack and take the Geyser Valley Trail through the river bottom to a junction with the Krause Bottom Trail. For a shorter loop, take a left here uphill and rejoin the Elwha Trail to return to the trailhead.Keep right, however, for more Elwha scenery and the chance to see black bears, elk, and osprey, not to mention wildflowers. At about 3 miles from the trailhead, you will reach a grassy, open area that marks the site of the former Humes Ranch. The Humes cabin and old fruit trees are the only things that remain from this homestead from the turn of the 20th century. To shorten your hike, take the trail back north from the ranch—uphill—for .3 mile to join the Long Ridge Trail. At this junction, stay left to soon rejoin the Elwha Trail at Michael’s Cabin.For the longer loop, proceed on the Krause Bottom Trail to the junction with the Long Ridge Trail at 3.5 miles just beyond Antelope Creek. Here, hang a left and gradually ascend to the Michael’s Cabin in .8 mile. At this point (4.7 miles), you rejoin the Elwha Trail. Follow the Elwha Trail as it gradually climbs back to the trailhead.

You’ll need a good map for this one. Walk the old road about a mile (or 1.6 if you parked near the entrance), veering right at both forks, to its end (Point 2268 on your topo). There are nice views up and down Rocky Coulee and over to Whiskey Dick Ridge here. From the end of the road, drop down the nose of the ridge into Rocky Coulee and head downstream to a good game-boot trail on the left ascending Whiskey Dick Ridge. There’s a basalt outcrop here with a small pillar and lots of petrified wood.

Here you’ll find sweeping views north and east across the basin of Whiskey Dick Creek to the Columbia Basin, south to the Saddle Mountains and Sentinel Gap, and west to Whiskey Dick Mountain and the pylons of the Wild Horse Wind Farm. This is a great place for lunch and lounging in the sun. To return, drop down to the road and continue west a short ways past the shallow saddle below Point 2693 and then traverse to a southeast-trending spur of Whiskey Dick Ridge. Drop down the nose of this ridge into the coulee and then climb back up to Point 2268 and follow the road back to your car. As always in the shrub-steppe, be alert for ticks and rattlesnakes.WTA Pro Tip: Keep an eye out for commonly seen wildflowers like bitterroot, Carey’s balsamroot, cushion daisy, Cusick’s sunflower, desert buckwheat, Hooker’s onion, lupine, narrowleaf goldenweed, rock penstemon, Simpson’s hedgehog, Thompson’s paintbrush, tidytips, and threadleaf phacelia."

The trails are built and maintained by the parks department with help from volunteers from the Hansville Greenway Association. The heart of the trail system is accessed via Buck Lake Park, where there is ample parking, though no facilities available. From the parking lot, the trail system begins across the baseball field (which can be very soggy when wet). Head down the trail to the first 'T' intersection, where you can walk 0.1 mile to the right for an overlook of Buck Lake before doubling back and taking the lefthand trail to the meadow and kiosk, dedicated to David Cunningham. The kiosk is the central hub for the trails here, stocked with paper maps for hikers. These are essential to a successful outing. While the intersections here are all well signed, having a paper map to plan your outing is a huge help. Head to Quiet Place, a spot on Upper Hawk's Pond dedicated to the memory of Maureen Vis. The platform here offers a great spot overlooking a wetland, where visitors can sit and rest off the main trail. If you visit during dusk, listen for the whoo-whooo of owls. Past Quiet Place is Lower Hawk's Pond, where stairs lead to an elevated wooden overlook, allowing viewers another lovely spot to observe wildlife, or simply enjoy another quiet retreat. There are miles of hiking opportunities in this network, but the hike from Buck Lake to Lower Hawk's Pond Overlook with the detour to Quiet Place is about 2.5 miles. WTA Pro Tip: The Hansville Greenway encompasses not only the trails around Buck Lake and Upper and Lower Hawk's Pond, but community trails that link the park to Point No Point Park (4.2 miles from Quiet Place), Norwegian Point Park, even a 1.2 mile detour to Hood Canal on the Sid Knutson Trail.

Formerly an old road bed, the trail begins as a flat path through mossy forests of redcedar, salal, and one or two small tallgrass fields. These meadows are being reclaimed from the invasive scotch broom plant, thanks to local community efforts. A third of a mile down the old road, it forks, and you can continue on the old road, or take the righthand branch and enjoy a slightly longer route. Both trails meet up at a junction, for a lollipop loop option, take one on the way to the beach, and one on the way back. Either way, the greenery of the forest surrounds you. Listen for birdcalls and look for other trail users – equestrians use this trail occasionally, though the route down to the beach is hiker-only. Arrive at a junction. To your right is Gazzam Lake, where waterfowl and other birds make their home. Listen for their calls as you turn left if you came from the main road (straight ahead if you came from the other trail). Keep the lake on your right, and don’t fret – you’ll get to take a closer look soon.Soon a small ‘Lake Access’ trail appears on your right. Duck down this to get a better look, if you wish. Otherwise continue on the main trail, where, a mile after last junction, you arrive at a ‘T’ intersection. The road to your right leads to the Marshall Hill parking area. This parking lot provides closer access for those wanting the most direct route to the beach. Take the left-hand trail (now hiker-only) and enjoy your last few hundred feet of relatively flat hiking. About a quarter-mile from the third junction, the trail begins to descend, gradually at first, but then the grade becomes steeper. As the water comes into view, the trail appears to head straight downhill, but stick with it – traverse across the hillside into some rollicking switchbacks that funnel you down to a staircase for the very last pitch onto the beach. Enjoy your lunch here and refuel for the climb back up. WTA Pro Tip: For the enterprising hiker, Peter’s Trail is a nice add-on from the Deerpath trailhead. It's a narrow, brushy trail wending through closer forest than the Gazzam Lake trail. It's a mile and a half round trip; do it before tackling the Gazzam Lake trail, since you won’t feel much like it afterwards, and it serves as a nice warm-up."

There are excellent viewpoints along the road, which snowshowers sometimes enjoy more than the lakes. On a clear day mountains such as Rampart Ridge, Kendall Peak, Granite Mountain, Silver Peak and even Mount Rainier line the distant horizon. Since the trailhead is about an hour from Seattle, the grade is gentle and the views superb, this is a popular destination. The route is relatively easy to follow because it follows an closed forest road. Experienced snowshoers who are good at route finding may go off the road and find their own routes to the lakes, but be aware of avalanche danger. The trail starts at the large sign in the Gold Creek Sno-Park. A Sno-Park permit is necessary to park your car here from December through March. From the Sno-Park parking lot follow the forest road in a northeast direction. It is flat for the first 0.3 miles then the road turns north and starts to climb. On weekends this area is a popular playground for family with inner tubes and sleds. As you climb higher the crowds thin out.At about 0.8 miles from the parking lot, the road turns sharply to the left. From here, more experienced snowshoers can go off the road and to find their own route. If you choose to stay on the road, follow it as it turns back on itself sharply to the right at about 1.3 miles from the parking lot. 1.6 miles from the parking lot, arrive at the base of a series of switchbacks. Here you can see Gold Creek Basin and Rampart Ridge to the east.From here, it is a long steady climb. There are places you can view mountains such as Silver Peak, Denny Mountain and Snoqualmie Summit ski area to the west. About three miles from the parking lot the road turns sharply right. Here again you can go off the road and find your own route if you are an experienced snowshoer, but take note - the incline of terrain here is steeper and more exposed than lower down. You must assess the avalanche danger. Following the road, you will reach a open flat area in about 0.3 mile. There is no view here, but if you continue south you reach a view point in another 0.3 mile. From this viewpoint, back track to the open flat area and continue going north on the road. This area is open and exposed. At about 3.8 miles from the parking lot, the road turns right yet again. Here, you'll head off the road and go north, traversing across mostly level open slopes for 0.2 miles, where you arrive at the first of the three lakes. It is possible to reach the middle lake through the forest, but avoid making for the third lake because the trail is steep and it is not safe to approach it in the winter.If you'd rather stay on the road, there are great views just 0.2 miles from where you head off for the lakes, at the end of the road. You can see Keechelus Lake, Rampart Ridge, and even Mount Rainier on a clear day."

The ash-soil is very light and easily disturbed.Start up the Lakes Trail as it skirts the developed amenities. The path stays well above the high-water mark of the lake, but not so high you can't enjoy the aquatic nature of the trail. Birds flit through the air around the trail, nesting and feeding among the bushes along the shoreline, and feasting on the fish and aquatic insects in the lake. As you stroll east, you'll pass a trail junction at around 0.75 mile out. The left fork-the Elk Branch Trail-leads up to the Coldwater Visitor Center. You might want to consider this trail on your return, if you still have the energy to climb. For now, though, keep moving east along the shoreline. As you walk, break out your binoculars-you did bring them, right? Pause now and then to scan the opposite shoreline and the slope above it. Elk routinely graze that ridgeline.The trail reaches the end of the lake at about 3 miles out. Although the trail does continue on up the Coldwater Creek valley, the end of the lake makes a great place to turn around."

The route is straightforward, but not without some minor huffing and puffing. You’ll be swimming against the current of downhill skiers and snowboarders, but the snow-covered high meadows will compensate for the traffic.  Take the obvious trail that veers off to the right from a downhill run, climb a steep hill and catch your breath at Austin Pass with its spectacular view of Mount Shuksan. Follow the path of the summer road as it traverses beneath a ridge, and then angle up before you come to the last big switchback below Kulshan Ridge (Artist Point). This switchback has seen slides and is the only dicey place on the route, so exercise caution. One more episode of vociferous grunting and you’re on top. Head southeast along the undulating ridge to the high spot at Huntoon Point, where basking in the winter sun can be a religious experience.From the Point, the North Cascades reveal themselves in a most breathtaking fashion. Mount Shuksan is resplendent and the Border Peaks form a magnificent chorus line against the northern horizon. Mt. Baker, the Great White Watcher, dominates all.

The Union Bay Nature Area is one of these wonderful little spots that offers a near natural environment within easy reach of many city dwellers. For the better part of the past century, this land was nothing more than a landfill, known by various names: the Ravenna Dump or the Montlake Landfill. The nature preserve itself started taking shape in 1966 when the dumps were closed. Over time, clean fill was brought in and the landfill was capped. Now it features meandering trails, park benches, several ponds, and is home to turtles, beavers, and a wide variety of waterfowl.The roughly 50 acres of renamed 'natural space' is bounded by sport fields to the west. The Center for Urban Horticulture sits to the north and east. This center has experienced growth of both native and invasive species. The preserve is now a large working laboratory with many active projects staked out. One of the lab's main objectives is to observe nature’s ability to cope with the decades of dumping it withstood. During your visit, you'll have a choice of several main graveled paths, towards the west a Loop, and Wahkiakum Lane. Numerous other social paths run in and out of the brush and around the vernal and more permanent ponds. Shoveler, Grand, and Carp are the largest ponds here. On the eastern end on the Center's buildings is a newly built 'Yesler Swamp Trail'.This area is a favorite for birders, with more than 200 species having been spotted here. In the late spring the ponds are often filled with squadrons of ducklings trailing around behind their mothers. Parking may be a little difficult to access, since the University of Washington uses most available parking for its students and employees. The Center for Urban Horticulture has a decent amount of parking in the streets surrounding it."

Run down the short hill, crossing the canyon floor, before beginning the climb.  The route follows the rolling hills toward 7 Mile Road, twice crossing Sand Road and staying generally beneath the powerlines for the first mile.  After the second crossing of Sand Road, the trail enters the forest and continues its gentle ascent. Note the large trees along the route, with one particularly impressive Douglas-fir located near the final switchback. The rocky outcroppings are covered in moss, and one can expect wildflowers here when neighboring park Mount Spokane is still covered in snow.At the top of the climb, consider pausing to take in the view from one of several park benches.

The original forest here was logged a century ago and now the trees are in a state of early maturation.At a quarter mile the trail jogs across an old logging road and soon enters old growth. The forest opens up with sword fern and shrubs among the stately trunks of ancient firs, which give way to hemlock as the trail climbs ever upward. It is cool and moist on the north aspect of the slope, enabling skunk cabbage and trillium to bloom into early summer. At two miles, the trail rounds a spur at about 2800 feet, before gently arching toward the lake.At 2.5 miles and 3100 feet lies tiny Mink Lake. Hemlock, silver fir, and marshy beargrass meadows line the tranquil waters, which are often disturbed by jumping fish. A side trail forks left where overnight hikers will find the bear wire and an old shelter, now home to rodents.Continue up the main trail beyond Mink Lake a quarter mile to another, very shallow lake nearly covered by encroaching meadows. At 3.5 miles cross a small stream and look to the right across open parkland to a pond framed by mountain hemlock. The Little Divide is less than a mile away now, but still 600 feet up. Several series of switchbacks wrap up the hardest part of the whole journey. Earlier in the season this final ascent may be snow covered. If so, head more or less straight up through the trees and the Little Divide trail should show itself on the ridgetop.At 4.3 miles is the marked junction of the Mink Lake, Bogachiel, and Little Divide trails. A peek of Mount Olympus is possible through a window in mountain hemlock boughs. Turn left (east) and proceed along the ridge at roughly 4100 feet. After 5 miles cross a wide depression in the ridge, left over from when the mountainside slumped under its own weight.At about 6 miles catch a brief glimpse of tiny Bogachiel Lake. The trail then rounds the headwall of the North Fork of the Bogachiel, crossing the Little Divide back into the Sol Duc watershed. Be wary of a high-angle snow patch that may bury the trail here and can linger into summer. At 7 miles a picturesque switchback rewards hikers with final meadow walk down to Deer Lake, at 7.8 miles and 3550 feet elevation.Meadows abound with wildflowers and tourists. The lake is popular with families on day hikes and campers on their way to the crowded Seven Lakes Basin. For a shortened return trip with fresh scenery follow the trail down from Deer Lake to Lovers Lane (don't miss Sol Duc Falls) which terminates at the resort and Mink lake trailhead (approximately 6 miles from Deer Lake). The patio deli at the resort serves reasonable lunches through mid afternoon. A soak in the hot springs is the ultimate way to end a long hike."

The trail crosses a picturesque footbridge and then follows the Lewis River with the river to the right and a mossy cliff to the left. The wide hard-surfaced trail is mostly flat, making this a perfect year round hike for people of all ages. This hike combines a peaceful stroll with a bit of adventure. After a short steep pitch down from the parking lot, the virtually flat trail allows you to cruise down the spacious path as fast or a slow as you like. For a side adventure, you can check out Big Tree Falls or climb the Bells Mountain Trail to a viewpoint.The drive to the trailhead follows part of the Clark County Scenic Drive and is worth the trip alone. The road follows a particularly beautiful stretch of the Lewis River as it flows over volcanic rock formations. The smooth rocks and small pools make this a favorite summertime place for locals to swim and sun. The road also passes the not-to-be-missed Lucia Falls. It is definitely worth stopping and taking the short walk to view one of the region’s most scenic water features. The hike starts at the Moulton Falls overflow parking lot near the junction of Lucia Falls Road with Sunset Falls Road. There are multiple paths in this area, so make sure to snap a photo of the map at the trailhead if you don’t have a map with you.  From the parking lot, turn left at the trailhead sign and go down the slope towards the river. Partway down the hill, you will come to a junction with a path leading off to the right. You will go left for this hike, but this is a good place to take a side trip to the right and go see Moulton falls. After you return to the trail, continue downhill to the arch bridge with its spectacular views of the Lewis River far below. On one side, the river flows through a narrow tree-lined canyon, and on the other side the river opens up to peacefully flow towards the falls. This is the best spot on the hike to take postcard-perfect pictures, so be sure to stop, enjoy the view, and take some photos. Just after the crossing the bridge, you will come to two junctions to the right leading to picnic areas. Keep left and stay on the wide path that follows an old road grade along the river through a mixed forest of big leaf maples, alders, cedars and Douglas firs. Although there is a road across the river, it is mostly hidden from view with the river masking the road sounds. A half mile from the trailhead, you will come to the Bells Mountain Trail. If you are feeling energetic, you may want to take a side excursion to a viewpoint 1.5 miles up the trail. This rigorous 1,000-foot climb will certainly earn you bragging rights if you decide to tackle it. Our hike, however, continues on the main trail along the river. In about a mile, the path leaves the river to follow the Chelatche Prairie Railroad to a small lake with a picnic area on the far end. This is a pleasant spot for a snack or picnic and is the turnaround point for this hike. If you would like a longer hike or need toilet facilities, you can go a half mile further to the Hantwick Road trailhead. After you turn around, retrace your steps back to your car.Before you leave, be sure to cross Lucia Falls Road and follow the trail to Big Tree Falls. These impressive Niagra-like falls are the best of the three in the park. When the steel bridge just below the falls is open, you can get striking views of the water as it churns through a narrow chasm beneath you. If the bridge is open, you can turn your trek into a 1.7 mile loop. Otherwise, turn around and return to your car.WTA Pro Tip: After the hike, consider stopping at one of the local wineries, soaking your feet in one of the pools along the river, or stopping at Rocky’s Pizza in Battle Ground for food in an eclectic old-west setting."

The logs were brought down the mountain on complex railroads and tramways, by way of elaborate switchbacks and trestles, to mills at Preston, Hobart, and High Point (do you recognize these names? Today, they're popular access points for the trail system on Tiger Mountain.) Artifacts of those logging operations - such as heavy cables, cranes and remnants of old camps - lie scattered on Tiger, partly hidden by the undergrowth.

About 80 miles of hiking trails exist on Tiger Mountain, most of which were constructed and are maintained by dedicated groups of volunteers. The Middle Tiger Trail is 11 miles one way, and traverses old forests and rocky balds, crossing several creeks and the Fifteen Mile Creek Canyon.

Because it crosses the Cascades at the headwaters of the Klickitat River, it became known as the Klickitat Trail. The trail travels in mostly open territory. With the addition of several other existing trails, the entire west side route can be traced. From the Cowlitz River Valley bottom at 950 feet elevation, the Pompey Peak Trail climbs to the ridgetop near Pompey Peak, joining the Klickitat Trail after about five miles. For nearly 15 miles, the trail stays on the ridgeline, always close to a mile high in elevation! This offers a wide variety of landscapes: deep forest, sub-alpine meadows, lakes and tarns, rocky peaks and cliffs, an abundance of wildflowers, and expansive views including Mount Rainier, Mount Adams, Mount St. Helens, and the Goat Rocks Wilderness.

There is one more stopping spot, Elk Lake, which shortens your day hiking distance to the glacier, but would make for a long approach on your way in. It is 17.5 miles to your first glimpse of the glacier, and another mile to the best viewpoint. Wherever you elect to set up camp, be sure to allow plenty of time to admire the glacier when you do decide to head there. Hikers are frequently struck by the majesty of its endless blue-tinged crevasses. The panorama includes a sweeping sight of the entire glacier, from the dome of Olympus to the moraine, a truly spectacular sight. On your return to camp, enjoy views of the mountains lining the long valley ahead of you, which houses and the headwaters of the Hoh River. Peer at the White Glacier, whose clifflike snout allows a waterfall to go plunging into the outflow from Blue Glacier. In 1812, the two glaciers were merged at Elk Lake. Note how far the glacier has receded in just 200 years, and imagine where it might be in another 200.

The conversion was created in order to create a more sustainable, safer route for hikers to a summit on the I-90 corridor. Hike through second- and third-growth forest, pass a lovely waterfall, and enjoy a slightly less-crowded trail than the nearby Mount Si.Begin your hike on an old logging road (a road to trail conversion worked on by the Department of Natural Resources). You'll climb gently through young forest and meadows for two miles. Switchback at a steeper incline for a further two miles, until you find yourself at a beautiful viewpoint of the Middle Fork Snoqualmie. You'll also pass a trail to the popular Teneriffe Falls--a worthwhile detour with a small overlook available to hikers, but note that it can only accommodate about 3 to 4 at a time, and slippery rocks and steep dropoffs make it a place to be extra careful with novice hikers or young children.To continue to the summit, cross a creek where a side trail angles off toward Mount Si. This provides ""back door"" access to Mount Si's summit, less than a mile away. However, your route is for a different peak; save Si for another day.  Bear right at the intersection, sticking to the road-to-trail conversion. After 1.7 miles of hiking, the road-to-trail becomes honest-to-goodness trail.

While it's a steep start, delectable views of nearby peaks, especially of the serrated summits surrounding Spire Mountain and El Capitan, offer nice diversions. Those impressive peaks across the Beckler River valley, along with the ridge you're now traipsing on, are all part of Washington's newest federal wilderness area, the Wild Sky (see ""Untrammeled Central Cascades"" in this section).After 0.75 mile the grade eases and the way becomes real trail.

The road is steep at times, rough in places, and sometimes totally blocked by high waters at the creek ford. However, patience and perseverance on the drive yield high payoffs on the hike. Wildlife abounds here, from flocks of mountain bluebirds to herds of elk. The lovely desert landscape is backed up by the craggy summits of the Cascades to the west and the deep, rocky cut of Yakima Canyon to the east.Additionally, the area is rich in human history as the Durr Road route in use today is the same route used by settlers traveling through the area in the 1880s. At times, the deep ruts carved by the steel-rimmed wheels on horse-drawn wagons are still visible parallel to the road.

Look for the bright bitterÂ¬root, spreading phlox, three species of balsamroot, shooting stars, yellow bells, desert bluebells, sage, death camas, and (with a reminder to look but not touch) prickly pear cactus. Folks who want to backpack in the desert country will find this route an excellent overnight choice. Make a dry camp on the ridge top or, by dropping an additional 2 miles from the end of the ridge route, you'll find camping opportunities near the Yakima River (dropping to the river stretches the trek to 14 miles round trip).The other option leaves the ridge-top road after that first 0.25 mile and descends to the right (south) along an even more primitive road track. This jeep path winds down bird-rich draws and gullies. Seasonal creeks dribble out of these gullies, sporting narrow bands of lush, green vegetation, which are home to birds and animals.About 1 mile down the road, the route angles back to join Durr Road.

Jim was a local tour guide and Central Washington University graduate who helped the local youth community avoid gangs and trouble to become more involved in hiking and climbing. He has been honored with a trail and monument named after him. The monument can be found at the summit of Baldy. There's a real danger of overheating on this trail in the summer months, so it may be best saved for an early spring or fall hike, perhaps even a winter conditioner. As you make your way up the steep trail from behind the gate across from Big Pines campground, there are two choices of trail. The first, T.P. Jim trail is steeper and does provide a minimal amount of shade in before coming up onto a flank of Baldy into the sun. The more gradual ascent is offered by the trail to your left once you pass through the gate. This is a more forgiving route as far as steepness goes, but it's very exposed. The way is straightforward, though the trail may be faint. Along the way, enjoy wildflowers encouraging you with every step in the springtime. In autumn, the fall color in the Yakima valley can be stunning. And on clear days, the panorama of the Cascade crest is gorgeous."

A second phase calls for an extension of the trail southward to a viewing platform.During the 1950's and 1960's human activity to ditch and drain wetlands on the Longbeach Peninsula severely damaged the Hines Marsh, an important wintering area for Trumpeter Swans and habitat for many other species of wildlife. The swans abandoned the area, but returned in 2003 following an extensive restoration effort by Washington State Parks with help from several other partners including the Trumpeter Swan Society. Park staff also worked with bird enthusiasts to envision a new trail project that would provide the public an opportunity to visit this unique area by linking it to the existing trail system at Leadbetter Point State Park. The plan calls for 1/2 mile of new trail across forested dunes plus nearly 700 ft. of boardwalk across portions of the wetland.

It's beautiful, but not without it's challenges, the first of which is at the trailhead: Ruth Creek has no bridge. Wade the creek, or cross on a log if one is available.

An occasional car might drive by with cross country skiers but silence generally rules the day. A note to those who may be concerned with following the trail: there is a local who stomps out many trails in the area after each storm so that they are well defined. There are also trail markers, semi-official 'Atlas Snowshoe' markers and the old-school metal-can-top-nailed-to-the-tree type marker. This no-elevation-gain trail winds through the woods following the Forest Service boundary for a half mile before making a sharp left and heading towards the river. Over the next half mile, note the incredible diversity of trees in this lush ecosystem. Cedars, cottonwood, a variety of pines, and spruces will light up your day. There are numerous spots along the trail where the riverbank opens up and the gurgling of Early Winters Creek calls to you. The bank is steep and can be undercut by the water, so be cautious, but enjoy the views. Black and white tones have never looked so good. After another half mile, evidence of beavers can be found. A black cottonwood, 100 feet tall and 2.5 feet thick is slowly being taken down by the resident population.

For one thing, the year-round access point is through an off-road OHV park, which visitors may need to hike through to reach the wilderness gate. For another, the whole of the 7,140-acre wilderness is enclosed by a fence. Old tire tracks that predate wilderness designation are still visible in some areas within the fence that keeps OHVs out, illustrating just how fragile this ecosystem is.Although it's impossible to leave behind the sounds of the OHV park, inside the wilderness gate the landscape is drastically different. Near the southern end of the wilderness, native grasses are generally out-competing noxious weeds blown in on the wind, and the hills are gently undulating. The farther north one travels, the denser the vegetation generally becomes, and the hills become steeper. Grass gives way to low shrubs and tall sagebrush to the northwest, and Washington's largest remaining juniper groves dominate the north and northeast.  The wilderness is home to diverse wildlife, both common and rare. Tracks and scat will be the main indicator of the flourishing populations, but it is likely visitors will be able to at least catch a glimpse of the numerous deer and coyotes within the wilderness. The juniper berries attract a large population of birds, especially in winter when forage elsewhere is scarce. Rare animals that can be found here include sagebrush lizard, black-tailed jackrabbit, grasshopper mouse, kangaroo rat, ferruginous hawk, and Swainson's hawk.                                                                                                                                                                 When planning a trip to Juniper Dunes, keep in mind that the wilderness limit is 8 heartbeats. Know that an overnight permit is required for backpacking, available for free by contacting the BLM office in Spokane.  Campfires are strictly prohibited, and visitors must be well-versed in Leave No Trace ethics. While dogs are not prohibited, the rugged nature of this area may mean it's best to keep dogs at home, or at least on a short leash. Many of the noxious weeds near the wilderness fence have thorns, and the southern portion of the wilderness area contains numerous beds of cacti. There are also no water sources within the wilderness area, so all water necessary for the trip must be carried in. Hikers need to be well versed in map and compass navigation skills when visiting here. There are numerous game trails crisscrossing the wilderness, but no maintained hiking trails.  Although the entire wilderness is fenced, and walking the boundary would total roughly 15 miles, a visitor would get little sense of the wild nature of this wilderness by sticking to the fence line. With USGS maps and compass bearings, perhaps backed by GPS waypoints, the best way to really see this unique ecosystem is to strike off across the rugged center. While the difference between the highest point and lowest point of this wilderness amounts to approximately 300 feet, the rolling nature of the landscape means hikers will gain and lose elevation many times, and can easily lose sight of distant landmarks. Loose footing contributes to the more difficult nature of hiking here."

This part of the valley was logged in war times when spruce was in high demand. Ferns and oxalis decorate the forest floor under the uniformly spaced trees.After 0.4 miles the trail enters Olympic National Park. Suddenly hikers are surrounded by large trees and tenacious shrubs. This is old growth. Several Douglas fir trunks over 10 feet thick disappear into the canopy and host a community of young hemlock trying to make a living in the crevassed fir bark.At about a mile the trail crosses a small stream, rounds a point, and descends to the level of the river. This is Big Flat, a glaciated bottom lying between two relatively high ridges which catch unfathomable amounts of precipitation.

Notice that even though plants cover everything one sees from ground to sky there is an ordered look to things. This is partly due to elk browsing, which has been the focus of extensive study in the valley. Moderation in species diversity is also credited to the overall landscaping design.A small meadow on the right invites explorers in at 2.8 miles, after which point the main trail becomes rough and faint. Trees often lie upon the trail and by midsummer grass and shrubs crowd the way. But soon hikers hear the river again just as the path strikes the foot of the north ridge. Here the river has cut into the base and the old trail has been washed away, which marks the official trail's end at 3.5 miles.It is possible to descend the bank onto the gravel bars and access the river.

This generally means keeping to the edges of the groomed trails and yielding right of way to skiers. As most of the trails do double duty as logging roads in the summer, there is plenty of room for all to enjoy the gently rolling terrain come winter. Follow the signs to Forest Road 92 which leads to “North District“ snow parks and the trailhead to Copper Creek. The distance to the hut depends as there are several snow parks which give access to the trail depending snow conditions at various altitudes. The lower the snow line, the longer the distance to the hut. Plan on a minimum of a nine mile round trip hike and note that Washington non-motorized Snow Park Permits are required at all the parking areas. The Copper Creek trail itself is great for families and beginner skiers and snowshoers. You will find the terrain mostly forested and gentle rolling hills gaining just over 1,000 feet of elevation over the distance from the most commonly used snowpark trailhead to the hut. The trail is well marked and along the way passes several trail junctions  which lead to loop trails which can be explored by the more adventuresome. Sightings of wildlife along the trail are common.

With more than 1,000 feet gained per mile, it is one tough training hike, but it is well-worth the effort it takes to get to the top.Long-proposed for protection as part of the Scotchman Peak Wilderness, this is a very wild area that's still easily accessible. The trail is undergoing improvements to its too-steep grade, so the round trip mileage will eventually be a bit longer. There's nothing to be done about the elevation gain, which is actually more in the winter when the TH is inaccessible and intrepid snowshoers and backcountry skiers must start a little lower down and closer to town. Check avy conditions before a winter visit.The beginning of the hike is in a recovering forest with few views, so watch for the local flora and fauna instead. Spring wildflowers eventually give way to summer huckleberries along the route. Approximately two-thirds of the way up, the trail leaves the trees and enters a rocky section. The views are impressive, with Lake Pend Oreille shimmering far below and other peaks all around.At the summit, site of an old fire lookout, keep an eye out for Mr. Scotchman (actually any number of local mountain goats). Please don't feed or approach the goats! The trail was closed for a time in the summer of 2015 due to habituated goats. Keep dogs on leash and keep all food stowed safely in your pack. Keep your pack on or nearby as well, as the goats will attempt to lick salt off the straps of unattended packs."

The Raptor Ridge trail is found along this artery, and takes you to a lovely viewpoint over the forested hills of Chuckanut. Begin at Arroyo Park, which itself is like a walk through a gorge in a mini rainforest. Heavy timber dims whatever sun there is outside, and the tangle of hanging limbs, lichens and sword ferns adds to an otherworldly atmosphere. From here, head up the hill and in about half a mile, go left at the sign for Lost Lake. The trail is a connection of overgrown roads, climbing through forest in various states of re-growth. Some deep and dark, others more open, with partial views to Mount Baker. Signs lead the way to Raptor Ridge Trail, about 3.5 miles from Arroyo Park. The forest here is almost cave-like, it's so dense (and seemingly always cold), an impression that's enhanced by huge boulders and overhanging rock faces. Shortly, however, the trail opens up revealing a 180-degree awe-inspiring vista high atop a rock cliff. It's a terrific lunch spot. Various hawks next in the area and eagles are often spotted flying overhead, hence the trail's name. Nearby, it's possible to connect with trails leading to Pine and Cedar Lakes, Lost Lake, and the Madrone Crest Trail. WTA Pro Tip: Don't forget your map! While the trails are well signed on Chuckanut, having a map to consult will not only help you see how far you've gone, but you can put together countless loops as well."

Access to the Wolf Creek trail is off of the Whiskey Bend Road in the Elwha Valley, or just off the Hurricane Hill Nature Trail, near the Hurricane Ridge Visitors Center. Coming from the Hurricane Hill junction, the way switchbacks down a gentle grade, allowing hikers plenty of opportunities to take in Alaska cedars which give way to madrones as you descend. There are several wet areas that can be soggy in the shoulder seasons, but for the most trail is a good one.Salal covers the area near the bottom, which provides a lovely green carpet, but can be a bit wet after a rain.

It's a long meander through the Tigers, passing near many high points but not going to any of them. As the raven flies, the distance from the southern end of the TMT to the northern end is about 7.5 miles. On the trail, it's over 15 miles of forest wandering. Along the way, hike through deciduous, coniferous and mixed forests, past areas with decaying stumps from century-old logging and at the southern end, through a few clear-cut areas that have been recently logged. Encounter moist areas with small creeks and an abundance of ferns and shrubs, drier areas with quite different vegetation, and areas where the forest canopy is so dense that little grows in the understory. Look for and appreciate these differences as you do the hike.See a variety of forest wildflowers in season. In early spring look for trillium, yellow violet, bleeding heart and coltsfoot; a bit later miner's lettuce, vanilla leaf, salmon berry and red currant; in late June or early July, tiger lily, goatsbeard, foamflower, mimulus, and thimble berry. Many other less common wildflowers are out there. If in doubt, take a photo and consult a wildflower guide at home.On your hike, you may notice rustic signs with quaint names such as Joe's Hollow, Manning's Reach, Ruth's Cove, and others like these. They were intended as a tribute to the volunteers who built the TMT in the 1970s. Some of the names are shown on the Green Trails map. Small markers were installed each mile to indicate the distance from the southern end, while here and there other markers were installed displaying just the letters ""TMT."" Sadly, in recent years many signs and original markers have disappeared, their fate unknown. Be alert for the remaining ones as you hike.From the trailhead, follow the TMT along the grade of the former Woods and Iverson railroad, built in the early days of logging to haul timber from the Tigers to a mill in Hobart. It's a quieter walk today, although you may hear some traffic sounds from nearby Highway 18. In early spring, some of the first trilliums to bloom in the Tigers will be found along this part of the trail.The first 4.5 miles of the TMT are shared with trail riders (equestrians), and at 1.1 miles, a sign directs them to turn right onto the ""Horse Bypass"" while your trail continues straight ahead. In another 0.2 miles, your way narrows and traverses the steep hillside of Carkin's Cliff. This precarious trail is the reason horses take a different route. Beyond the traverse, arrive at the sign identifying Hobart Gap, where the foot and horse trails rejoin.Continue east on the ongoing trail and in 0.8 miles, reach a powerline. Head northeast under the powerline (the route is shared by the TMT and the South Tiger Powerline Trail.) In about 200 yards, turn left at the sign where the TMT leaves the powerline. Stay with the TMT as it traverses 1.2 miles around the east side of South Tiger Mountain. Along the way, listen for the sounds of Holder Creek below. The trail widens and is joined on the left by the South Tiger Traverse -- it may be shown on your map as a trail, but this end of the Traverse served briefly as a logging road a few years ago so it looks like an old forest road. Continue north on the TMT and in an additional 0.1 mile, cross the West Side Road (Road 1000), one of several non-public service roads in the Tigers.Beyond the road, traverse the lower edge of a clear-cut area, then make a very sharp left turn at Zeig's Zag. About 0.2 mile beyond the Zag, the TMT is crossed by a logging road that leads up clear-cut Karl's Peak, a minor viewpoint. From the TMT itself, you can see East Tiger Mountain--at 3,004 feet the highest point in the Tigers--and, in the distance to your right, part of the summit dome of Mount Rainier may be visible, clouds permitting.Continue, following an old railroad grade through forested areas around the west and north sides of Karl's Peak, then skirt more clear-cut area before entering mature forest again. At 1.6 miles from Zeig's Zag, come to Millan's Crossing. To the right, the Middle Tiger Trail climbs over 400 feet to the 2,607 foot summit of Middle Tiger (no view.) To the left, the Middle Tiger Trail drops steeply 900 feet to reach the Hobart-Middle Tiger RR Grade, a worthy hike in its own right. For today, continue on along the TMT.Traverse around the forested south, west and north sides of Middle Tiger Mountain, passing several named locations. Keep an eye out for the signs! At 1.2 miles from Millan's Crossing, note a sign for ""Hobart Grade"" with an arrow seeming to point straight ahead. Don't go there! That's an unofficial route that drops down to the Hobart-Middle Tiger RR Grade. Stay on the TMT, which makes an easily-overlooked right turn here, just when your eye might be distracted by the Hobart Grade sign.Arrive soon at Paul's Cove, a moist area that, in early summer, displays a good flowering of pink mimulus. A half mile beyond Paul's Cove, reach the approximate mid-point of your hike at Custer's Bridge.Custer's Bridge is as remote a spot as you are likely to find anywhere in the Tigers, in terms of distance to a trailhead. So you might have it all to yourself. The bridge is a low, rustic structure crossing the head of Fifteen Mile Creek. In spring, look along the banks for skunk cabbage. In summer, when the vegetation is so thick you may have difficulty seeing down to the water, look for ripe salmon berries and a few wildflowers. Any time, spring through fall, the bridge is a pleasant stopping point, so why not pause here, enjoy a sip and a snack, and relax for a few minutes to the soft sounds of the flowing stream?When you are ready to continue, climb a bit on the TMT and cross the Fifteen Mile RR Grade. Climb a bit more and, a half-mile from Custer's Bridge, come to Lone Rock, a glacial erratic boulder perched quietly amid the trees next to the TMT. If your previous Tiger hikes have included the Talus Rocks Trail then you have seen boulders of comparable size. But those on the moist north side of West Tiger are heavily covered in moss. Lone Rock, here on the drier south side, is less adorned, and the characteristics of the stone can be appreciated more readily. Take a close-up look, run your hand over it, and perhaps scramble part way around to compare the different sides. Continue on another mile, passing Wally's Glen, and cross the small, fancifully-named Hopping Bridge. It crosses a small, seasonal stream that may be dry when you do your hike. And, though there are a few rabbits in the Tigers but it's unlikely you will see any here.In another 0.2 mile pass Larry's Crossing and an intersection with the Hidden Forest Trail. Going right, uphill, would lead you about a mile to the West Tiger #1 summit at 2,948 feet. Going left, downhill, would take you to the Fifteen Mile RR Grade and, eventually, the West Side Road.Stay on the TMT and, in another 0.1 mile, come to a junction with the One View Trail. This is a route to Poo Poo Point or to the High School Trail. On the next 1.4 miles of the TMT, cross the head of Many Creeks Valley. The numerous creeks here are small, and most are seasonal. The vegetation often is particularly lush along this section of the TMT. Farther along, come to Manning's Reach where a very small bench offers room for one or two hikers to sit. There is a minimal view through the trees down to the lowlands, although tree growth is shrinking that window so it may disappear in a year or two. Manning's Reach is one of the high points on the TMT at an elevation of about 2,500 feet. Drop slightly, and in 0.1 mile reach Pete's Pass where the TMT crosses the ridge between West Tiger Mountain's #2 and #3 summits, each of them less than a quarter mile away. Continue on the TMT, traversing an area with very little growth in the understory. Press on to Tom's Crossing, actually a T-junction. At just over 2,500 feet, it's the highest point on the TMT. In spring, look for red currant blooming here. From Tom's Crossing, the West Tiger #2 Trail heads steeply uphill providing another way to reach that summit.Continue down the TMT on many switchbacks and, in about 0.3 mile, note the junction with the K3 Trail. From here, the TMT takes a long loop to the east, then swings back west at a lower elevation. The K3 Trail is a shortcut across that loop, cutting off about 1.5 miles. Tempted? Wait! You are out to do a through-hike on the TMT! So save the K3 information for a future hike. You might wonder about the K3 sign that says ""Unmaintained Trail."" That just means it relies on volunteers for maintenance; it's as good as any trail in the Tigers.Until 2014, the TMT switchbacked steeply downhill from its junction with the K3, passing a junction with the West Tiger RR Grade, then traversing a former gritty landslide and crossing a bridge over High Point Creek. If you have hiked this part of the TMT before you probably remember this section and your map may still show it as the route.In early 2014, the bridge was removed and in the summer of 2014 an entire section of the TMT was rerouted to avoid the former landslide and to bridge High Point Creek at a more secure location upstream.From the K3 junction, take the new section of the TMT. If the arrows on the metal trail sign seem somewhat confusing, check the wooden sign on the left side of the trail. It shows clearly which is the TMT. Head generally south, initially with a gently downhill grade that steepens later. Then cross High Point Creek on a new, very secure bridge. A bit further along, meet up with the old route, make a right turn there, and you are back on the familiar part of the TMT. Continue on to Fred's Corner, a trail junction in an area of tall maples. While you are there, look up in the trees. It's not unusual to see a few wild pigeons, very different birds from their urban, street-smart cousins. The trail forks here, with the West Tiger RR Grade heading uphill to the right and the TMT continuing on downhill. Descend the TMT from Fred's Corner and, when the trail levels out in about 0.4 miles, look on the right for a very small fir that often is decorated with a few holiday bangles, even in summer. It's one of two (at least) such trees in the Tigers (another is near the Bootleg Trail above the Paw Print Connector.) It's not known who keeps up the decorations, or who sometimes removes them.About 200 feet past the tree, reach Ruth's Cove. It's a pleasant spot where a new small bridge crosses a tributary of High Point Creek. In spring, skunk cabbage blooms here. This is a good place to pause for a quick break.Beyond Ruth's Cove, descend some more and pass signed junctions with the Lingering Trail and the High Point Trail. Just beyond the High Point Trail, reach the lower crossing of High Point Creek. A few years ago a bridge here was heavily damaged by flood waters and blowdowns. It now sits tilted, off its moorings, and sections of its railings are missing. Chains at either end support ""Bridge Closed"" signs. Other postings have hinted replacement was due soon, but it as of summer 2014, it hasn't happened. When the water level is low there is no problem crossing the creek just upstream on boulders.A half-mile west of High Point Creek, note the junction with the lower end of the K3 Trail. From here, you have about two more miles to go to finish your TMT hike. Beyond the K3 junction, cross two tributaries of High Point Creek on sturdy bridges, then come to a long, relatively straight section of the TMT termed ""Anschell's Allee."" Once you are past the Allee, descend about 900 feet, with many switchbacks. Then cross the ""Cable Route,"" that infamous and unofficial trail up West Tiger #3 fancied by exercise enthusiasts.Beyond the Cable Route, the TMT becomes less steep and has fewer switchbacks. Soon, it levels out completely and merges, first with the West Tiger #3 Trail, then with the wide, graveled trail that leads north a quarter mile to the developed High Point Trailhead - a real contrast to the completely undeveloped trailhead at the TMT's south end.At the High Point trailhead, pat yourself on the back; you have completed the TMT! Congratulations on completing this classic Tiger Mountain hike. If you found some surprises along the way, or had unusual wildlife or wildflower sightings, or if you found conditions much changed from what is described here, please consider writing a trip report. We'd enjoy hearing the highlights of your experience hiking the TMT."

But there are still a few signs that the Forest Service is actively reclaiming the area - the all too flat beach at the south end of the pond, the hay along the first part of the counter-clockwise loop, dandelions.But back to the hike - and the pond. Going counter-clockwise, the first part goes through willow and wildflowers along a creek to the junction with the Gold Creek trail. Keeping to the loop, hikers will soon leave the pavement and begin on a well-maintained boardwalk. This takes you above a marshy area until you cross over the creek at the north end of the pond. The views open up here as you look across the pond to the south. The pond (which looks more like a lake) beckons. It is crystal clear, blue and very deep. You don't need to scramble down to its banks, because a paved spur trail leads hikers down to it. Kids will enjoy throwing rocks in the water and exploring. After enjoying the pond, head back to the trail where in a short way you will end at a picnic ground. Numerous picnic tables are on this beach, though in mid-summer none are in the shade.

The rock is one of the many upthrusts of volcanic rock in this area of massive lava beds, and Sheep Lake is a cool pool of sparkling water nestled in the folds of lava near the base of Burnt Rock. The trail passes a few small barren lava beds, some deep old-growth pine and cedar forests, and fields of huckleberries big enough to satisfy the hunger of a battalion of bears and an army of hikers. The berries of Mount Adams are legendary for their size, their number, and their sweet sun-enriched flavor. Berry bushes line this route from start to finish, sometimes in small clumps in the open forest, sometimes in vast berry patches in the clearings. It's a wonderful thing to be able to hike all day, nibbling on juicy fruit as you walk, with wonderful views of the snow-capped mountain before you.The trail begins at the Mount Adams Wilderness boundary and climbs modestly through old-growth pine and spruce forests for nearly 2 miles. In the first mile, a small lava bed can be seen through the trees to the right of the trail-it looks like a black gravel pile from a distance, but if you scramble over for a closer look, you'll find it is more like a black boulder pile. Huge blocks of jagged basalt rock are piled haphazardly around the field, left by a flow of molten lava coming from a vent in the side of the mountain. The route occasionally drops close to the crashing waters of the West Fork of Adams Creek, but generally stays on the slope above.At 1.8 miles, you'll pass a small side trail-this leads south about 0.5 mile to a pretty campsite at the edge of a meadow known as Divide Camp. A mile past this spur trail, the West Fork Trail ends in broad meadow at a junction with the Pacific Crest Trail. High above the PCT to the east is the white monolith of Adams Glacier, headwaters of Adams Creek. Turning south on the PCT, you'll hike along the upper edge of the heather-filled meadow, staying near the line where lush meadow gives way to a world of rock and ice.The trail stays near the 6100-foot level for nearly 1.5 miles before crossing a 0.5-mile wide lava bed. You'll want to make sure you stay on the trail as it cuts through this jumble of lava, as the black rocks of the bed are brittle, and often razor sharp. The Pacific Crest Trail descends gradually just past the lava bed, dropping to another trail junction at 5700 feet (6.1 miles from the trailhead). Stay left to remain on the PCT, and in another 0.25 mile you'll reach the small pool of Sheep Lake. Good campsites can be found here. An alternative is to bear right at the last trail junction and hike about a mile through open meadows, crossing Riley Creek, to the west side of Burnt Rock. Deer, elk, and mountain goats frequent the meadows between Burnt Rock and Sheep Lake; with plenty of huckleberries in the well-watered meadows, bear are also frequent visitors to the area. Please use proper bear-bagging techniques when camping here."

Established campsites with fire pits, benches and tent platforms await a weekend of camping with the kids. This trail also makes a pleasant weekday hike for those with creaky knees, as it is not difficult. As you hike, enjoy the many plants and animals that make the lowland bog environment home.The trail starts out following an old logging road, the once open space filling in with a young forest understory of ferns and huckleberry surrounding the small trees. Take a moment to read the nice, somewhat hidden trailhead kiosk with information about the Mount Pilchuck NRCA, and the environment in which you will be hiking. The old roadbed path is lined with bunchberry, (white dogwood-like flowers and red berries to come later), foamflower and false lily of the valley. In a half mile, come to a plank bridge over a brackish creek. Enter a more mature forest missed by the chainsaw where the true trail begins. Come to the first boardwalk, a long path over a bog with some Jurassic-sized skunk cabbage growing in the mud. After crossing the boardwalk, the trail will start to climb a small ridge. Once at the top, you have reached a high point and will begin to drop down into the lake basins.After descending the ridge, come to a fork in the trail. The left fork heads a short distance down to the shores of Beaver Plant Lake, at just under two miles from the trailhead. The right fork continues on to Upper Ashland Lake. Take the path to Beaver Plant Lake and drop down to the shoreline. There is a boardwalk that heads a short way to a nice bench perched on a platform, and a good view of the lake. The lake here is very green as the edges are slowly being reclaimed as a grassy marsh. Look for the pink flat-topped flower clusters of rosy spiraea, a low shrub that grows in the moist rocky soil.  There are a couple of camp spots back in the trees with a bench and fire pit.  After checking out the lake, head back up to the intersection and follow the trail as it heads past Beaver Plant. Between the two lakes, come to an intersection with the old Bald Mountain trail on the left. This once was an established trail that followed the ridgeline past Bald Mountain to Cutthroat Lakes, but is no longer maintained. Stay to the right and in a quarter mile reach Upper Ashland Lake and more boardwalk. Keep your boots dry by following the boardwalk along the length of the lakeshore. Notice a pink flower with five petals in an open cup, blooming in early summer. Those from the east coast may recognize the flower. It is western bog laurel, a close cousin of the eastern mountain laurel. It prefers an acidic, peaty soil and grows here happily with the huckleberries. At the end of the lake is an intersection, with campsites to the right and the trail leading down to Lower Ashland Lake to the left. Lower Ashland Lake is the biggest lake and the most scenic. You will descend to the lake on a rooty trail, losing a couple hundred feet of elevation.  Mostly forested, you can still partly see the cliff face on the other side. Once at the lake, the trail follows the lakeshore to the other end and a nice camping area with two tent platforms, a fire pit and log benches. Notice a couple of nice large rocks close to shoreline. If the bugs aren’t too bad and you don’t mind wading in a bit of mud to get there, you could take a nice dip in the lake. There are some interesting white flowers growing in the shallow muddy water you may notice on the way. Called buckbean, the flowers have hairs on the inside of the petals and the smell is not the best. The trail continues a short ways to the end of the lake and a picturesque little bridge that crosses the outlet creek. The middle of the bridge is a great vantage point for viewing the whole lake. The trail continues to a platform on the opposite side of the lake and stops. Enjoy your lunch here or back by the fire pit. WTA Pro Tip: In previous guides, the trail down to Twin Falls has been mentioned. The trail is now deemed hazardous and is closed. Should it ever be reestablished it will be worth a visit, but for now, please respect the request of the Forest Service and save the hike for when the trail reopens."

With a trailhead at either end, it's easy to hike a portion of the full route or arrange a point-to-point hike with a shuttle vehicle.  The Lower Mount Kit Carson Loop Road trailhead begins from the hairpin turn at 3920 feet. The trail crosses portions of Burping Brook shortly inside the gated access. Visitors will find picnic tables tucked beneath giant cedars in three locations within the first mile, making short hikes and relaxing picnic dinners an inviting option. Just past the one-mile mark, the snowshoe hut at Smith Gap offers visitors a chance to get out of the elements year-round. The hut was constructed though generous grants and numerous private donations.  Please practice pack-it-in, pack-it-out when utilizing this park resource. Beyond Smith Gap visitors will notice the forest beginning to change as the trail continues to climb and enters a drier portion of the park. The cedars are replaced by lodge pole pine in this section of the forest. Once visitors reach the Day Mountain Road intersection, located approximately a quarter mile beyond Smith Gap, they've joined the old Cook auto route. A stone wall near this intersection is all that remains from a 1932 monument, set up at a location where overheated vehicles needed to stop while their drivers added water.  As the trail contours around the backside of Mount Kit Carson there are more views to the west and north. At approximately the 4 mile mark, the trail enters an area of private in-holding that was logged; soon thereafter the forest increases in density again. At around the 5 mile mark, visitors can see the west side of Mount Spokane for the first time. At 6 miles, the Civilian Conservation Corps Heritage Area is accessible via a short spur trail.

You will return to this point near the end of your trip. At 4.5 miles, pass a good campsite with a toilet at Red Creek and then at 6 miles, reach Mackinaw Shelter and the last dependable water before White Pass.Switchback steeply upward for another 2.8 miles through open avalanche tracks and meadows to the junction with the Pacific Crest Trail, turning right (east) on the PCT and hiking another  mile to White Pass. Good camps can be found below the pass. Turn right where the sign directs you down to the lower pass area and camps. Please respect the ""Camp Elsewhere"" signs and do not camp on the ridge above the camp area near the PCT. The Forest Service has spent decades working at restoring the delicate vegetation here, that had been badly impacted from over use.If you have the time, use White Pass as a base camp and take a side trip or two. The trail from White Pass along the base of White Mountain and out to the Foam Creek Basin is absolutely beautiful! Expect incredible meadows and flower shows. When the trail seems to disappear, hike up to the top of a small knoll and gaze out to breathtaking views in all directions. Glacier Peak dominates the scene but Mount Baker, Sloan Peak, Pugh, White Chuck and dozens of other peaks are visible. Look down from there into the upper White Chuck basin, a land of snow, rock and ice.Another highly recommended side trip from White Pass is to hike  west along the PCT to Red Pass and up to the summit of Portal Peak, just northwest of the pass. It's a fairly easy scramble on an established track along the ridge to the summit, although you may need to use your hands for balance in a place or two. More incredible views from there! Back down at Red Pass, you can continue hiking north and east on the PCT and down into the Glacier Peak Meadows area. Another interesting diversion is to hike to the top of the White Chuck Cinder Cone, visible just to the north of the PCT.To continue the loop from White Pass, head south on the PCT over miles and miles of mind-boggling ridges, meadows and flower fields, passing Reflection Pond, Kid Pond, Indian Pass, Kodak Peak, which is worth hiking to the top. One mile after passing the Little Wenatchee Trail junction, find yourself at Dishpan Gap. There is a great campsite here, despite being right on the trail. Hang a right at Dishpan Gap and hike west 0.8 miles. Bear right on the Blue Lakes High Route. This route is rough and passes over several sections of scree. You should feel confident in both your route-finding abilities and surefooted if you want to attempt this route. Alternatively, you can go around the High Route, and continue hiking another two miles west on the Bald Eagle Trail towards June Mountain, then turn right onto Trail 652 to Blue Lakes and proceed to Little Blue Lake. This adds about 4 miles to your loop.The Blue Lakes High Route ascends a steep, cairn-dotted trail to a high pass with a beautiful view across to Johnson Mountain and down to a sometimes frozen Blue Lake in a rocky basin below. The trail down from this notch to the lake can contain a very steep snow slope in early season. If you think you'll be uncomfortable on it, stick to the Pilot Ridge Trail to access Blue Lakes. Blue Lake is spectacular, and a wonderful place to camp. There is a good toilet near the campsites. Blue Lake also offers the last reliable source of water before the North Sauk.To continue onto the Pilot Ridge Trail, take the trail northeast from the lake outlet that descends to the Pilot Ridge Trail junction. Keep right at the junction, ascending through talus and scree for a bit an then on to the huge meadows that traverse the slopes of Johnson Mountain. The trail turns back to the east, following the west ridge of Johnson Mountain, reaching the Johnson Mountain Trail junction, Trail 652.2. With spectacular meadows, flowers and territorial views from the top, the short 0.5 mile side trip to the summit of Johnson Mountain is a must. The entire south Glacier Peak region lies before you. Check out the old lookout site and the four stone pillars that used to support the lookout. What a perch!Back at the junction, continue north and west on the Pilot Ridge Trail 652, crossing huge sloping meadows that seem to go on forever. The trail tread through these meadows has not received a lot of maintenance in past years, but is still fairly easy to follow. Eventually the trail finds its way down to the forest but then heads back up and down, and up,then finally  switchbacks relentlessly down for 2.5 miles to the North Fork Sauk River.The trail reaches the valley floor where you're able to cross the North Fork Sauk River on your choice of several stout logs.

Learn more here - www.wta.org/middleforkupdatesNOTE: This is the description for the OLD trail up Mailbox Peak. The entry for the NEW trail can be found here: http://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/mailbox-peak/The old route up Mailbox Peak holds a special place among the peaks along I-90. It has traditionally been a rough climber’s trail, an unrelentingly steep, rooted, rocky, muddy torture test, a crucible in which the summits of summer are forged. More than almost any other trail, it assaults gravity with single-minded determination, proceeding more or less due east straight up a ridge line to the summit, gaining some 3,800 feet in two and a half miles after an initial short jaunt up a DNR road. There is nary a switchback in sight. This makes it an attractive, but treacherous, prize for hikers. Scarcely a year goes by that some hapless party doesn’t get lost here, despite the white reflectors that mark the trail. For this reason (and to bring a halt to the horrible erosion associated with the existing trail), the Department of Natural Resources has been building a new trail, on the north side of the peak. This new route, scheduled for completion in 2014, will wend its way to the top in a relatively civilized five miles, though nothing can diminish the elevation gain between the Middle Fork Snoqualmie Road and Mailbox’s 4,800-foot summit. For those still looking for the brutal ascent to the summit, start up the gated road, bypassing the inviting new trail  about a hundred feet past the gate, on the left. Roughly a third of a mile from the gate, turn left into the woods. A sign with warnings about the difficulty of the trail (it's not exaggerating) marks your point of departure. The next fifth of a mile is relatively gentle and scenic, traveling along a runoff stream in tall forest. And then things get steep. The trail starts climbing and doesn’t stop - a very brief flat section in a third of a mile is a very momentary aberration. In fact, the trail grows steeper and steeper over the next half mile until it is pitching upwards at its steepest angle. Though it may not get any steeper from here, it hardly lets up. Along the way, there are few landmarks to mark your progress, just slight changes in the surroundings. In 0.15 miles, the trail crosses into dark, dense new forest – the least scenic stretch of trail. In 0.15 miles more, the trail starts traveling over exposed roots that are incredibly slippery when wet (which is often). After a third of a mile of these root ladders, break out into the open for the first time. In a quarter mile, the trail heads back into the trees to the north, avoiding an open talus slope to your right. When snow blankets the trail, an unofficial route heads directly over the rocks, but in summer, avoid these rocks. In another fifth of a mile, the trail joins the open ridge for the rest of the way to the summit. On any but the nicest days, a stiff wind blowing from right to left will be your constant companion from here on. Mailbox is not known for its scenery, but the terrain is not without its rewards. From the first talus slope all the way to the top is proper wilderness, forested with old gnarled trees that have survived the harsh winds of many a winter. On a nice day, the views from the summit are as good as any along I-90. Mailbox stands at the prow of a long ridge, giving it greater prominence – ubiquitous Mount Rainier seems even closer than it does from Bandera or Granite. In early summer, the final half mile is covered in beargrass, lupine, and Indian paintbrush, as well as several other varieties of wildflowers. In winter, every tree, rock and blade of grass along the summit ridge will often be spectacularly rimed with windblown snow and ice. The greatest reward, however, is merely the joy of the effort itself, of digging deep within yourself to summon the strength to conquer the mighty Mailbox and inscribe your name in the summit register contained – appropriately enough – in a mailbox someone installed at the top."

Nestled at the base of Chikamin Ridge and just a short jaunt from the Pacific Crest Trail, this lake is one of the true gems of Snoqualmie Pass. There are several options to access Spectacle Lake. You can approach from the north or south along the Pacific Crest Trail, or via the Mineral Creek Trail, which sets you up for a hefty hike of more than 26 miles. Luckily, there's a more straightforward way to get there: by starting from the trailhead near Owhi Campground at Cooper Lake. From here, follow a relatively flat trail with little elevation gain to Pete Lake. Depending on the time of year, there may be creeks to negotiate along the way, but none should present a serious obstacle. Pete Lake, about four miles in, makes for a great lunch spot or overnight camping destination for first-timers or families. Just be warned that it's a popular place -- you won't be alone if you decide to visit Pete Lake.  A scant one mile from Pete Lake, you will encounter Lemah Creek, which can present a challenge to even the most experienced hikers depending on the season. If fording the creek or crossing on a log seems unsafe you can opt to take a 2.7-mile detour, but be sure to refer to your map if you choose to do this. Consider replenishing your water in Lemah Creek if you're running low -- it's a relatively reliable source even late into the season. Crossing the creek, the trail soon joins up with the Pacific Crest Trail, passing through a burnt-out area left behind by the Lemah Creek fire of 2009. Pause to take in blooming fireweed and the sound of woodpeckers, evidence of nature at work bringing this area back to life. You'll need a break before tackling the switchbacks ahead -- nearly all of the elevation gain on this trail occurs in the last mile. Fortunately the grade is reasonably gradual and well-constructed, and a bridge over a pretty waterfall breaks up the climb. At the top of the ridge, encounter a junction: Park Lakes to the left, Spectacle Lake to the right. Turn right. Soon you'll see spectacular Spectacle Lake below. It's a steep, rooty scramble down to the bottom, so watch your step. Once at Spectacle Lake, the way is not entirely obvious. Multiple social trails course their way through the foliage, the legacy of campers looking for the perfect spot. The terrain around the perimeter of the lake is relatively steep, most of the campsites are clustered on a hilly isthmus that juts out into the lake. A precarious privy perches on a hillside above the south side of the lake. The good news is, you really can't go wrong. Find a good tent site and enjoy one of the area's best alpine lakes."

Douglas himself. In  Of Men and Mountains, Douglas devotes a chapter to Jack Nelson and his wife Kitty, the first gatetenders of the Bumping Lake Dam (completed in 1913). The two made an excellent team and kept an eye on the lake for the next thirty years. Douglas would stop at their cabin as a young man and drink a cup of hot coffee before his own hikes along the trail and into the wilderness. Today the Bumping Lake trail still offers unique old-growth conifer stands, a range of wildlife from elk to wetland dragonflies, and a deep connection to Washington history.The trail starts in woods near cabins and heads quickly down to the lake shore. After filling out a wilderness permit, stop to admire the views of Nelson Ridge across the lake’s eastern end. The trail then heads west, staying mostly above but near shore, traversing talus fields peppered with wildflowers. The hillside is steep in this first section, so access to the water is mostly visual. Look for large nests on the standing snags in the lake; the snags are remants of the former forest that stood here before the dam’s construction. At about 1.5 miles, ford Boulder Creek; a stout footlog is presently available. The trail continues through forest, and at 3 miles, crosses Cedar Creek by another ford. Immediately across the creek, pass a good forest campsite on the right. Along this level stretch of trail look for giant Douglas firs and towering larches. Wildflowers, including wild strawberries and cow parsnip, line parts of the trail, along with red elderberry and blueberries. You also can’t miss the spectacularly large anthills of the red ants, reaching 3 or more feet in height -- be careful of lingering too close to the piles of twigs and needles. Soon the trail begins to climb gently, reaching the wilderness boundary and, shortly afterwards, the junction with the Swamp Lake Trail #970 at 4 miles. After this junction the trail descends to ford Cougar Creek. Use caution here early in the season (through roughly mid-July) when the water is high. A quarter mile later the trail meets Fish Lake Way trail #971a. Here you have a range of options. Backtrack left along trail #971a for a short jaunt (.2 miles) to the Bumping River. Or, continue along trail #970 past meadows to Fish Lake (5.6 miles distant) and a junction with the Pacific Crest Trail. Or, turn around here and hike the 4.5 miles back out to your car."

Legend has it that Gardner used the cave as his base for a bootlegging business, until a streak of bad luck at poker resulted in the loss of his deed to William Crawford, who ultimately signed the property over to Washington State Parks.The geologic history of the cave is far older, of course. About 500 million years ago, the site was ocean floor. The shells of dead sea creatures decomposed into an ooze that would eventually become limestone. The uplift of the Selkirk Mountains caused the limestone sediment to fold and crack. Later, as water seeped and dripped into the cavern through the calcium-rich limestone, an array of deposit formations began growing into unique and interesting cave features.Stalactites, like icicles, cling to the cave roof. Stalagmites build from the cave floor up. Where the two meet, a column is formed. The 7.8-ton Gardner Cave column is the largest in the Pacific Northwest. Human imagination has led to the naming of several other formations: the Frozen Waterfall, Christmas Tree (dated to 90,000 years), Roast Turkey, Lopsided Wedding Cake, Queen’s Throne and the Frog.Cave Tours: Tours are offered every Thursday through Monday at 10 am, 12 noon, 2 pm and 4 pm, from May through mid-September.

Although the trail is broad and easy to follow all the way to the ridge crest, ample opportunities exist for snowshoers who want to show off their climbing abilities by heading straight up the open slopes.But this trail isn't all work. Plenty of rewards await the dedicated athletes who point their snowshoes toward the top of this ridge. Best of all, even those who cut their trips short of the top will find the journey pays off tremendously. Views from the route are incredible, and the higher snowshoers go, the better the panoramic scenery. The jumbled peaks of the South Cascades spread away to the southern horizon with Mount Rainier dominating the skyline.A small trail leads northwest from the Sno-Park for a 0.25 mile to Forest Road 4832. Turn left and hike west a couple hundred feet to leave the multi-use crowds behind. (Snowmobilers, skiers, skijorers--skiers pulled by one or more dogs--and even dogsledders use this trail.) Climb to the right onto a small side road, FR 124. This road climbs steeply up the flank of Keechelus Ridge alongside Price Creek for 0.5 mile before angling west away from the creek in a long, looping route that isn't too steep but does cover several miles. You can stick with the road, but a faster, more enjoyable route is to head cross-country up the slope, slicing across old clearcuts and thin stands of forest.The best cross-country ""trail"" is found about 1.3 miles out from the Sno-Park. As the road rolls farther west away from Price Creek, snowshoe up the slope away from the track, staying right while the road goes left. Parallel Price Creek uphill, but stay on the bench above the stream rather than descending into the brambles alongside it. The slope rolls upward over several small benches and false summits, crossing clearcuts old and new. In light snow years, take care to avoid hooking a snowshoe on some of the brush protruding in the older, grown-over cuts.The climb covers about a mile of distance before crossing another heavily used road, FR 4934, just below the ridge crest (4300 feet). Emerge onto that road at about the same place as FR 124, which finally loops back from its long journey around the ridge flank. Rather than joining FR 4934--a popular snowmobile route that creates a long loop when coupled with several other roads in the area--merely snowshoe across it, and head toward the ridge crest. This last 0.5 mile of climbing is also cross-country travel, although you can follow the road (FR 124) here too, if you are nervous about routefinding on the open ridge. The top is easily identifiable on the approach by tall radio relay towers. Once there, put the towers behind you (thus keeping them out of sight) and enjoy the panoramic vistas of the eastern Cascades.Author’s Rating: More DifficultSome previous snowshoe experience helpful. Some winter survival skills recommended (basic knowledge of avalanche evaluation, emergency shelter construction, etc.). Elevation gain is usually less than 1000 feet with a gradual slope."

The trail ends at the junction with Sasse Mountain trail, where myriad opportunities to continue into the Teanaway are available. Only hikers and horses are allowed on this trail. Due to it's being abandoned, it is not much used, and while it stays in fair shape during the summer, trail maintenance crews do not make it here often, so expect obstructions. Volunteer crews do visit occasionally to keep the way clear, but the tread becomes very faint at the top. The trail climbs from the trailhead at a grade of about 1000 feet per mile for 3.5 miles, so it is for seasoned hikers. The tread is slumping and narrow in places, having not been maintained in many years.Note that should you elect to hike this trail, there are mapping errors and in many cases it doesn't appear at all. USGS Cle Elum Lake does not show the trail at all. Your best bet is Green Trails 208 for Kachess Lake, but note that the easy crossing of Howson Creek is at around 2700 feet, not 2900 feet as indicated. Also, once you get to the saddle at 5350 feet, the trail continues directly east up the ridge toward Sasse Mountain to around 5500 before it turns sharply south a few hundred yards to the Sasse Ridge Trail.  The Green Trails map erroneously places the trail a few hundred vertical feet lower on this section where no trail exists.The trail begins in quiet forest, following an old forest road to Howson Creek. Crossing the creek, it switchbacks up through the edge of an old clearcut above the creek. At 3350 feet there is a second creek crossing. Despite this, bring plenty of water with you, since there is no water past this point, and this creek may run dry late in the season.Above 4000 feet the trail is back in light forest, with game trails entering from the north. As it nears 5000 feet, it crosses a talus slope with nice views toward the French Cabin Peaks.From the mostly open saddle, an unmarked trail heads north, while the main trail, indistinct at first, heads directly east up the ridge until it turns right at 5500 feet through forest to the meadows on Sasse Ridge. As it enters the meadow, the trail disappears. Head left and down to intersect the Sasse Ridge trail at 5550 feet. Find a metal ""Howson Creek"" trail sign deeply embedded in a tree, facing south.The wooded summit of Sasse Mountain is only a few hundred yards north up the wide Sasse Ridge Trail. Beginning here, mountain bikes are allowed. For a longer trip continue north to Jolly Mountain. If you're more interested in another peak-bag, head back the way you came to the saddle.

Learn more about the project here - http://www.wta.org/middleforkupdatesThe way to Goldmyer Hot Springs is a delightful forest walk through deep woods, along the rushing Snoqualmie River, and ultimately to a beautiful hot springs tucked against the Alpine Lakes Wilderness. Because it is privately owned by a non-profit, reservations are strongly recommended and are the only way to assure access to the property and hot springs. The caretakers will turn away visitors without reservations if they meet their 20 person a day limit. Visit www.goldmyer.org for more information on reservations and access.There are several ways to get to Goldmyer Hot Springs, including beginning at the parking lot for the Pratt Connector Trail and taking the trail for the Middle Fork Snoqualmie upstream. When the Middle Fork paving project is complete, this will be the easiest way to get there. From the Middle Fork parking lot, cross a beautiful, large bridge over the mighty Snoqualmie River and turn left. The trail stays close to the river, ducking in and out of the adjoining woods. At points, due to erosion, the trail threatens to slump into the river, but the way is never impossible to navigate. Eventually though, the trail turns away from the river and continues on through beautiful second-growth forest. It’s hard to believe that these trees are a second-generation–-soaring high above your head, they are draped by mosses, much like old-growth. The effect is very peaceful and conducive to deep thinking or meditation as you walk along a trail springy from layers of pine needles that carpet the forest floor. Six miles in, come to a junction where a sign points to Goldmyer Hot Springs and Dutch Miller Gap straight ahead. To the left, another trail branches off, crossing a large bridge. Less than half a mile down this trail is a different access point for Goldmyer; the parking lot for Dingford. From the parking lot, bicyclists can also access Goldmyer Hot Springs via an old road. Hikers can walk this road too, but the trail unfolding before you is many times more scenic than the old road, and the road to the Dingford parking lot is as bad, if not worse, than the Middle Fork Road of old. Take the trail pointing towards Goldmyer and enter even more enchanting forest. The trail bobs up and down along an ever-calming Snoqualmie River as you hike past old- and second- growth forest dripping with mosses. Enormous boulders laced with lichen and hugged by tree roots growing over them inspire the imagination, and there is still the springy trail to enjoy. Pass several dispersed campsites, scattered with artifacts from when this was still an active logging area, and four miles in, come to another junction. A trail here branches off, marked for Rock Creek. This is yet another way to access Goldmyer, but it is steep, steep, steep, and frequently choked with blowdowns due to the difficulty that any trail maintenance crew has getting back here. Carry on past this junction. This section of trail looks the most like the old road that it once was, but it hardly detracts from the lush surroundings, and the quiet. A series of creek crossings of increasing difficulty are required to reach Goldmyer this way, culminating in the caution-inspiring crossing of Thunder Creek about one miles past the junction for the Rock Creek trail. A narrow log about six feet above the water is all that spans this rushing torrent, with no handrail or any other measure to prevent a slip into the creek. Cross here with extreme caution, then marvel as you continue on at the mountain bike tracks evident in the dirt on the other side of the creek! Mountain biking is permitted here on odd-numbered calendar days from June 1 to October 31 depending on the conditions of the trail, so don’t be surprised if you see a cyclist coming your way. Maybe ask them how they negotiate that crossing with a bike.From Thunder Creek, it’s just about one more mile to Goldmyer. Hike through more forest, and finally come to a large meadow, with greenery up to six feet tall. Once through this meadow, arrive at a complicated structure crossing a large creek. This is Burntboot Creek, and the three logs that cross its wide span have been carefully placed so you can cross securely.On the other side of Burntboot Creek, you are on Goldmyer Hot Springs property. Hikers are allowed as far as the entrance to the hot springs, where a billboard welcomes you and offers information about the resort, but without reservations, the hot spring are off-limits, so be sure to make those reservations before you undertake this 12-mile journey.WTA Pro Tip: Please note that while dogs are allowed on the trail, dogs and pets are not allowed at Goldmyer. If you're hiking with your canine, consider making the bridge over Burntboot Creek your turnaround point, since it's only a few steps on the other side of the creek before you hit Goldmyer property."

If you're lucky, you may see a soaring bald eagle or ruby-crowned kinglets and spotted towhees in the brush. If you do miss the turnoff, you'll continue down the other side of the mountain along the Waddle Creek Basin trail, so if you're heading downhill for any considerable length of time, you'll know to turn back and find the trail to the peak.WTA Pro Tip: Stop to admire the views facing Mount Rainier before you continue on to the top of the mountain and around to the other side to follow the loop trail back to the main trail. There's no lookout spot, so the best views are along the trail when you're almost, but not quite, to the top."

Much of the shore is taken up by homes, but you can enjoy expansive views across the lake from both the western end and eastern end. And much of the hiking path is bordered by trees that give the illusion of a more rural setting.Our hike description begins at the small parking lot near the western end of the lake, just off 156th Ave SE. But this is a loop hike, so you could choose other starting options and adjust accordingly.It may be helpful to download a trails map from the site parkstrails.myparksandrecreation.com/Details.aspx?pid=100 (Click on ""Detailed map of the Phantom Lake Walkway,"" not on ""Map/Directions."")From the parking area, a path leads past the toilet and crosses a wide grassy area, heading toward the lake. A signboard proclaims ""Water Flows Downhill."" This may seem obvious, but the details are much more interesting. They tell how excavations by late 19th-century settlers such as Henry Thode had a major impact on lake levels and stream flows in this area.Continue on toward the lake, where the path forks. The right fork leads to a picnic table that offers a marginal view of the lake, partly obscured by cattails. The left fork leads to a pier and viewing platform that offers a great view across Phantom Lake. Pause a while and take it all in. It's a great photo-op, and you may see ducks and other waterfowl while you are here.When you are ready, head back to the parking area and take the gravel path that leads up to the wide concrete sidewalk that borders 156th Ave SE. Ignore the traffic noise - you soon will be following less traveled streets - and continue south until you cross SE 24th St. Then turn left on the sidewalk that follows along the southern edge of that street. If you are alert, you may catch glimpses of Cascade peaks off to the northeast beyond the treetops. Soon, the path changes from concrete to blacktop, and it weaves in and out of the trees. Remnants of a much older dirt path are visible nearby, still maintained and still in use. You may prefer the rustic feel of the dirt path, and clearly others do too.East of 166th Ave SE the street begins to arc around to the left and it becomes 168th Ave SE. For the next half mile or so it follows the western boundary of Weowna Park. Your hiking path sometimes passes into the trees at the edge of the park and offers views down into the dark forest. (Check our Hiking Guide for information on hiking the Weowna Park trails.)Keep an eye on the street signs at intersections where side streets come in from the west. At SE 16th St turn left and head west along that side street. There is no sign at the intersection to indicate that SE16th St offers anything more than suburban homes. But press on, and in about 0.15 miles come to its western dead end. There, tiny Robinsglen Nature Park, a green area with no facilities, provides access to the eastern shore of Phantom Lake, with fine views across the lake that are perhaps best in morning light.When you have had your fill of this eastern shore viewpoint, return to 168th Ave SE. (Alternatively, you could turn left on 166th Ave SE and take it through to SE 14th St for a slightly shorter, but less picturesque route.) At 168th Ave SE, resume your northbound route and follow the path as it bends around to the west, becoming SE 14th St. (You soon will pass the intersection with 166th Ave SE.)Continue west on the path along SE 14th St and, in a few blocks, pass through the rustic boundary of Lake Hills Park. You can explore the park if you like. It offers the usual picnic tables and rest rooms, and it has a large parking area that could serve as an alternative starting point for your hike.Your route continues on through the trees as SE 14th St bends southwest and becomes SE Phantom Way. Soon, the street bends back west and becomes SE 16th St. At the intersection with 156th Ave SE, turn left and follow the path back to your trailhead at the small parking area where you began."

The route is accessed via the Cabin Creek Sno-Park and one of the more popular cross-country skiing destinations in the Snoqualmie Pass area. Begin by finding a spot to park in the Cabin Creek lot, but hold off on strapping on the snowshoes, as the trail begins on the opposite side of the freeway. Your first task is to navigate the maze of ski loops to get on the path to the summit. Keep to the right following the signed Berg route for about a quarter-mile until you encounter signs pointing uphill to Amabilis.The road is often groomed. If is when you visit, try to avoid stepping in the ski tracks by walking to the side. If it hasn't been groomed, walk single file in a path separate from the cross country ski path.The route follows FR 4822 as it slowly switchbacks up the mountain. Just past the two mile mark, the trail forks. Head left for about a half-mile to a small widening in the road signed FR 123 on the left side of the trail. You can cut out 2/3 of a mile of forest road by taking a shortcut here up through the pines and taking in some of the views along the way as the trees begin to thin. Once you regain the road, continue upward, passing excellent westward views of Kachess Lake a little before you reach the top. From the top enjoy views of Kachess Ridge to the north, rising above Kachess Lake. To the south, a sea of ridges and mountains spread out toward Mount Rainier. To the northwest, the jagged peaks of the Three Queens and Chikamin Ridge stand out against the skyline. Rest up so that you can enjoy breaking new trail on the way down if you choose to go cross-country.WTA Pro Tip: Note that the lot is a little too small to support the vehicle traffic on the weekends, so try to get an early start."

More acreage was later purchased to bring the watershed to 800 acres, however water quality issues led to the use of other water sources. Now this beautiful wooded area is managed primarily as a nature preserve, with a focus on protecting its wide variety of habitats, including ponds and other wetlands. In the interest of protecting the quality of these habitats, the preserve has enacted the following rules: no pets, no alcohol, no fires or smoking, and no firearms. Please abide by these rules in order to keep the outdoor experience pleasant for all trail users. The park's trails are multi-use: popular for hikers, trail runners, mountain bikers, and horseback riders. Be prepared to share the trail and look out for horse droppings. An underground natural gas line and pipeline regional trail above it runs north to south through the middle of the park, and an overhead power line runs east to west. Several regional trails pass through the park. You can pick up a brochure -- which includes a trail map -- at the signboard near the parking lot. The park has more than seven miles of trails, but take note of which ones are open to which kind of users. The Trillium Trail on the west side of the park is for equestrians and hikers. Siler’s Mill Trail on the east side of the park is gated and for hikers only. Each of the trail intersections is signed and has a map letting you know where you are. To see as much of the park as possible, make a 4.5-mile long loop starting from the parking lot. Take the Trillium Trail and the Siler’s Mill Trail by connecting them with multi-use trails. The grade is gentle and the trails are mostly in good condition. The loop goes up and down and gains about 400 feet total in elevation. The trails run through second-growth forest of Douglas firs, cedars, cottonwoods and maples. The trees are covered with moss and the ground is covered with sword ferns. Enjoy the chirping of birds, the croaking of frogs, and the smell of fir trees."

The BBG’s winding pathways, elegant gardens and 150 foot suspension bridge provide hikers and families with a visual cornucopia and gentle refuge from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. Open since 1992, the BBG has about nine distinct gardens maintained with the help of the Bellevue Botanical Garden Society, the City of Bellevue, local gardening groups and volunteers.  Park in the main lot and cross the service road to the main entrance. Stop by the BBG visitor center on your right (open from 9:00 AM – 4:00 PM daily) to pick up a map of the BBG and, if needed, an accessibility guide providing descriptions and lengths of the paths. The paths are mostly made of gravel and vary from mildly rolling to at times a bit steep. Benches are scattered generously throughout the BBG and provide a gentle encouragement to sit down and relax for a while amidst the tranquility. Two notable excursions in the BBG are walking the Tateuchi Loop Trail and visiting The Ravine Experience. The Tateuchi Loop Trail is a half mile loop that winds through the core gardens at the BBG. To reach the trail, turn left from the visitor center onto a path and follow signs for the Yao Garden.  Stop by the Yao Garden on your left and pass through the traditional Japanese gate. Admire the Japanese maple, azaleas and rhododendrons planted to honor the sister city relationship between Bellevue and Yao, Japan. After you’ve explored the Yao Garden, head back to the Tateuchi Loop Trail past the Native Discovery Garden, bearing right at the next intersection towards the Perennial Border Garden. Stop at the Perennial Border Garden to wander through the allium, foxglove, red hot poker, lavender and many other colorful and spectacularly diverse flowers on display. Continue on the Tateuchi Loop trail towards the Sharp Cabin and read about the history of the families that lived and worked on the land prior to it becoming a public garden. Continuing on, bear right past the Rock Garden and up a short hill to the Shorts House. Take a snack break at one of the tables outside the Shorts House while admiring the neighboring Fuchsia, Perennial and Waterwise Gardens.The Ravine Experience features a canopy-like forest setting with lush plants, a diverse bird population and a 150 foot suspension bridge that crosses a steep ravine. Pick up the BBG’s Ravine Experience Nature Guide at the visitor center to help you identify birds and plant life, then turn left from the visitor center onto a path and follow signs for The Ravine Experience. Proceed about one-third of a mile downhill until you reach the bridge. Once you cross the bridge, a short loop can be hiked that is about one-quarter of a mile long. Keep an eye out for the black head and bright blue body of the Steller’s Jay, or the distinctive reddish-orange belly of the American Robin.The BBG is open from dawn until dusk, and there is no entrance fee. Pets are not allowed in the BBG with the exception of service animals. Restrooms are located next to the visitor center and at the Shorts House. Water can be obtained by purchasing bottled water from the seasonal espresso stand in the Shorts House.WTA Pro Tip: The BBG has devised a couple systems to help you identify plants in the gardens. One way is via the “Collections Search” tab on the BBG’s website.  Click on the “Collections Search” tab and then click “by location”.  On the interactive map, choose a garden that you would like to learn more about, and then choose a flower bed within that garden to pull up pictures and names of the plants there. Alternatively, you can download a QR code reader onto your device before you arrive. Use the QR code reader to scan the barcodes at stands populated throughout the gardens designed to help you identify and learn more about the plants you are looking at."

We suggest getting the Interpretive Trail Guide from the Visitor's Center, which is closed on Sundays. Try incorporating all three trails by doing the hike as a figure-eight loop. Snake Lake is a 17-acre serpentine-shaped lake and wetland area in the preserve. Home to the spectacularly colored wood duck, which is frequently seen at the first bridge, the lake also hosts mallards and Canada geese, common year-round residents. The plants and animals that live here are representative of those that share life with us in an urban environment.

The farm was first a logging camp before being converted to a dairy farm in the early 1900s. The Nakashima family, one of a few Japanese families living in Snohomish County, ran the farm until 1942 when they were forced to sell the farm and sent to internment camps. The Nakashima Barn is the first to be designated “Washington Heritage Barn” status by the Washington State Department of Archeology and Historic Preservation in 2006.

For the first three-tenths of a mile, you’ll be hiking the Wonderland Trail, the 93-mile route that encircles Mount Rainier. Luckily, your hike today is considerably shorter. Keep left at the first signed junction as the rolling trail continues through dense forest. Come to a short side trip down to a viewpoint at Eagle Cliff, and your first full-on view of Mount Rainier to the southeast. Back on the main trail, you’ll pass Eagle’s Roost Camp and a lovely creek and waterfall that serves as the campers’ water supply.

Start looking left for climbers scaling Hessong Rock and Fay Peak. Now look right — Rainier comes into view and makes all those switchbacks worth it! Notice several blocked social trails where hikers have trampled through the heather in search of marginally better views. You can set a better example by keeping to the main trail and walking and lunching on rock whenever it’s available.Roughly two miles from the junction with Spray Falls Trail, Echo Rock and Observation Rock come into view, with Tahoma (the Native American name for Rainier) large in the background.

Sometimes called “Around Mother Mountain” (check the map and you’ll see why), the hike starts and ends at Mowich Lake. You’ll start north from the lake, hiking mostly level on the Wonderland Trail, steeply down from Ipsut Pass, level again along the Carbon River, across the Carbon on a sand bar with log footbridges, then again on a suspension bridge, then up Up UP along the Spray Park Trail through Seattle Park and Spray Park. It’s a 16-mile, 4,400 foot-gain thigh burner that’ll leave you grinning from ear to ear.WTA Pro Tip: Consider packing a cooler in the car to enjoy lunch at one of the many picnic tables at the Mowich Lake walk-in campground. Be mindful though, and clean up thoroughly afterward. As evidenced by the bear poles and food lockers, the campground is frequented by wildlife in search of human food."

This nice little hike will take you around the lake on a hiker only trail.  Take this hike in spring for the fresh new leaves and the dainty spring flowers, or hike on a rainy day in winter and watch the mist float above the lake among the trees. The lake is very popular on hot summer days. Two trails start right at the trailhead. The left hand trail, #237 follows an old road directly to the lake. However, you'll take #201 on the right, the slightly longer route, but more of a true trail. Wind your way through the second growth of Doug-fir and cedar that make up this forest. The first swampy area of the many to be found on this hike will be along this section. Look for the bright yellow bracts and huge tropical looking leaves of our native skunk cabbage. The flowers are actually on the spike in the middle. Look closely and you may see a pollinating insect. This plant is found in freshwater swamps and along streams shaded by trees. In just under a mile, there will be an intersection with #21, go left on #21 and shortly there will be a three way intersection, a vault toilet and garbage can. Take #20 towards the lake, reach the northern end of the lake and intersect with #204. On the right there will be a sign for the Anacortes Forest Lands and the Kenny Oakes trail. Take #204 heading around the lake counterclockwise. Ignore all side trails heading uphill and stay along the lake shore trail. There are lots of inviting little vistas and great places for a picnic lunch along this section of shoreline. Admire the red bark of the Pacific madrone trees hanging over the water. Watch for ducks and other wildlife, if you are lucky, you may see an eagle or even a coyote. The trail leaves the shoreline and climbs above it, then through a small section of woods. There is lots of our native red huckleberry growing on old nurse logs. A member of the blueberry family, it has bright orange berries in the summer which are edible, but very sour. You may see the distinctive basal leaves of rattlesnake orchid, a green rosette with prominent white veining. The flowers will be a stalk of small white orchid like flowers. Take a left on a little side trail that ends up on a large rock outcropping with a view of the lake and the island at the southern end. In spring, look for paintbrush, Oregon fawn lily and fritillaria, a dainty brown checkered flower.Head back into the woods and intersect with #21 and #202, head left on #21, then shortly reach another intersection. Here is a nice large wooden map with a ‘You Are Here' marker, showing you at the intersection of #21 and #22. Be advised, though, that this map is from 2007 and many of the trails are not on it. Take #22 left through the forest and past another swamp. Watch for trail #205, this will continue your journey around the lake, but it first goes through the woods around a rock bluff. Note the few large stumps left from the original forest. You will soon face another intersection; stay on #205. Pass Toot Swamp and speculate on how it may have gotten the name. Cross a cute little wood bridge, reach the lake again, and begin heading uphill. Reach the top and the way flattens out before dropping back down to another intersection. Stay on #205. Once past the intersection the forest opens up and there are some nice rocks above the lake to enjoy lunch with a view. Once done with lunch, continue north until you hit the northern tip of the lake again. Return on the old road for a complete loop back to the trailhead. Extending your hike: The Anacortes Community Forest Lands covers 2800 acres and has miles of trails. It is possible to put together a much longer hike, including a hike to Mount Erie or Heart Lake. Be advised that many of these trails are open to mountain bikes, horses and motorcycles.  The ACFL is managed by the city of Anacortes and supported by a non profit citizens organization. Consider picking up an envelope at the trailhead and making a small donation."

The route meanders back and forth between the Skagit River and the highway, sometimes closer to the river, other times right next to the highway, but always with scenic views of farmland and foothills. In winter one can see tundra swans and snow geese poking about in the fields. Near Lyman, the trail hugs the banks of the Skagit before the river begins a southerly meander. At Hamilton, users pass near log yards and over backwater sloughs where one can spy blue herons, red-winged blackbirds and kingfishers.Just east of Hamilton, the trail crosses the North Cascades Highway and continues its travels on the north side of the valley. The bit of elevation gain on the trail occurs here, as the trail ascends to traverse forested slopes above the banks of the Skagit River as it meanders back north. One can spy eagles along the river, or look east to Sauk Mountain and peekaboo views of peaks of the North Cascades.Near milepost 19 the trail passes through land designated to protect the Skagit River population of the North Cascades elk herd. Here, elk trails crisscross the grade, and Hurn Field, the meadow they call home, is visible below. Shortly thereafter, one comes to a small park recently built by Skagit County Parks. It abuts Challenger Ridge Winery. One can either have a picnic lunch and enjoy the small fish pond or wander down to the winery for such wonders as wood-fired pizza, chowders and wine tasting."

Along with unobstructed panoramic views of Mount Baker, the Twin Sisters, and the rest of the North Cascades, the route to Park Butte offers campsites, wildflower-filled alpine meadows, rushing waterfalls, and a stunning variety of mushroom species.Park Butte is one of the most popular Mount Baker area hikes for a variety of reasons: unobstructed mountain views, a moderately steep trail with access to campsites, and an open, maintained historic fire lookout built in 1932. The Forest Service now uses advanced technology to search for fires, but decades ago fire lookouts proliferated on the peaks of the Cascades. One of the few remaining intact lookouts is on Park Butte; it is maintained through the volunteer efforts of the Skagit Alpine Club.The trail leaves the parking area at 3250 feet of elevation and heads west, crossing a bridge over Sulphur Creek and passing through Schrieber’s Meadow. At 0.1 mile, on the right, is the first intersection with the Scott Paul Trail. Continue left through the meadow, enjoying wildflower overload in the summer and a berry bonanza in the autumn; species that grow here include heather, salmonberry, blueberry, huckleberry, fireweed, lupine, and pearly everlasting. As you ascend with rushing Sulphur Creek and its waterfalls on your right, see how many mushrooms you can identify; a partial list includes yellow cracked bolete, peppery bolete, blackfoot paxillus, northern Russula, sharp-scaled lepiota, deadly lepiota, and fly amanita. WTA has performed trailwork here, building puncheon to maintain a trail through myriad rivulets of the boggy meadow.After 0.7 miles, leave the meadow to cross Rocky Creek and the boulder fields through which it passes. Sometimes a ladder bridge is necessary to cross the main “channel,” which frequently changes position. Note that cairns may mark the locations where you should enter and leave the boulder fields. Once across Rocky Creek, the terrain changes as you enter old-growth forest, and the grade stiffens a bit. Take in the mountain hemlocks and yellow cedar that surround you as you switchback up and to the northwest. At two miles, you reach the second junction with the Scott Paul Trail, at 4400 feet. Continue left, and enter Morovitz Meadow, where Koma Kulshan presides over fields of heather, mountain ash, wildflower, and vaccinia berry bushes that blaze flaming red in fall.In 0.4 miles come to the junction with the Railroad Grade Trail, which leads to the Easton Glacier and is a frequently-used route for summiting Baker. Stay left and descend to Bell Pass Junction, passing through boggy meadows. After 0.6 miles keep left and ascend again for 0.7 miles over rocky tread to Park Butte, which now dominates the view opposite Koma Kulshan. Skirt boulder fields as pika brashly squeak “eep!” at passersby. On your left, pass—or visit—a series of tarns that reflect the summit block of Baker on clear days. Just before you make the final push to the lookout, take in Pocket Lake below you and to the southeast.When you reach the lookout, at 5450 feet elevation, take care as you climb the ladder. Sign the lookout register, or even pen an entry in the poetry register. Gnarled mountain hemlocks, subalpine fir, and noble fir surround the lookout. Directly north are the Black Buttes, Lincoln and Colfax. To the southwest are the Twin Sisters, and the Nooksack River valley heads west to the horizon. And if the fates favor you with a sunny day, bask in the views of the sheer white glaciers of Koma Kulshan.WTA Pro Tip: first-come, first-served camping overnight is available in the fire lookout. Arrival (at the lookout) as early as 10 or 11 am may be necessary to snag this perk!"

It's a quieter walk today, although you may hear some traffic sounds from nearby Highway 18. In early spring, some of the first trilliums to bloom in the Tigers will be found along this part of the trail.Your hike follows trails shared with trail riders (equestrians) and, at 1.1 miles, a sign directs riders to turn onto the ""Horse Bypass"" while your trail continues straight ahead. In another 0.2 mile, your trail narrows and traverses the steep hillside of Carkin's Cliff - the reason horses take a different route. Beyond the traverse, arrive at the sign identifying Hobart Gap, where the foot and horse trails rejoin.Continue east on the ongoing trail and, in 0.8 miles, reach a powerline. Head northeast under the powerline (the route is shared by the TMT and the South Tiger Powerline Trail.) In about 200 yards, turn left at the sign where the TMT leaves the powerline. Stay with the TMT as it traverses 1.1 miles around the east side of South Tiger Mountain. Along the way you will begin to hear the sounds of Holder Creek below. The trail widens and is joined from the left by the South Tiger Traverse.This may be shown on your map as a trail, but that part of the Traverse served briefly as a logging road a few years ago, so it looks more like an old forest road. Turn sharply left onto the South Tiger Traverse (road) and follow it uphill. As it begins to level off there is an apparent fork in the trail, with the former logging road heading left and another wide path heading right. An unhelpful sign proclaiming ""South Tiger Traverse"" is posted in the middle of the fork, with no indication which branch is preferred. Take the fork to the right of the sign and, when the trail levels out completely, look for a signpost on the left. (As of Jan 2015, the sign is missing.) The former sign indicated a trail to the right that climbs a small knoll to reach the Carole Hapke Lunch Area. The actual Traverse heads south on the left, behind the now-unsigned post. You can check out the Hapke Lunch Area if you like, but it's mostly favored by equestrians. A short, rough trail climbs about 100 feet to the top of a small knoll where there is a hitching bar for horses and a fire pit. A few years ago the knoll offered a view of Middle and East Tiger Mountains. But small trees have grown vigorously. Later, the view still was available to anyone who scrambled up a tall stump. But the trees have outgrown even that height, and today there is no view at all.Your ongoing trail, the South Tiger Traverse, continues on south behind the signpost. It passes through an area that was logged a few years ago. An occasional tree was left standing, and today there is a vigorous growth of small trees, brush and fireweed that is much easier on the eyes than the scene immediately following logging.The route exits the cut-over area and enters the forest. In about 300 yards, be alert for a large stump on the left, a remnant from logging a century ago.  Two cut marks near the top suggest eyes, and helpful hikers have scratched in a mouth below to complete the face, but continuing decay may obliterate the ""smile"" in a few years.At the north side of the stump take the unsigned, but venerable trail that climbs a quarter mile up to the south summit of South Tiger Mountain, gaining about 250 feet. At worst you may have to step over or duck under an occasional blowdown, and soon you will be on top. The summit is forested, and there is no view. A USGS survey marker is located within a ring of stones, and the official elevation is 2028 feet.True mountain climbers would smile at the thought of calling it a ""summit,"" but a few years ago South Tiger Mountain actually offered a summit register for climbers to add their names to document their achievement. The register, unfortunately, has been gone for a while now, but you could write a trip report and include a selfie!To continue, descend back to the South Tiger Traverse the way you came, or see Extending Your Hike for an optional visit to the north summit. Either way, end up back on the South Tiger Traverse. Continue on south and eventually come to the powerline. Cross directly under the powerline, pass by a generator, and find yourself on another forest road.Take the road downhill, curve around to the right, and come to another trail. Not familiar? Turn sharply left, walk a few feet, and you will be back at Hobart Gap.From the Gap, take the TMT back across Carkin's Cliff, and continue on to the trailhead.Extending Your HikeNorth Summit of South Tiger MountainFrom the south summit, peer through the trees to the north and you can make out the contours of the north summit about a quarter mile away. It may be a few feet higher than the south summit and, because it was logged a few years ago, it offers the views you are denied on the south summit.Going to the north summit is optional because the first part of the route is quite rudimentary (as of summer 2014.) If you opt to try it, look for a faint path leaving the south summit and heading through the trees toward the north summit. When the path leaves the trees and enters the logged-over area, the next 100 feet or so may be overgrown and somewhat prickly. But persevere, and you soon will come to a good trail. (The trail is not shown on your map, but it's a continuation of the logging road that takes the left fork from that ambiguous sign.) Turn right on that trail and follow it all the way to the north summit. Like the Hapke Lunch Area, the north summit is visited by equestrians and offers hitching anchors for horses, and a fire pit. From the summit, enjoy the view toward the north. East Tiger Mountain is the one with the towers, and is the highest point in the Tigers, at 3004 feet. To the left of East Tiger you can see the rounded, still-forested dome of Middle Tiger Mountain standing at 2607 feet. The high point to the right of East Tiger is known in trip reports as Sally's Summit, although that name has not yet made it onto the topo map. Sally's Summit is at 2786 feet; the third highest point in the Tigers, after East Tiger and West Tiger #1 at 2948 feet. If you have not been to these other Tiger high points they are possibilities for future hikes.Your best option now may be to return to the South Tiger Traverse the way you have come, first going back to the south summit, then taking the trail back down to the Traverse."

Since then, hikers of all stripes have had the pleasure of enjoying a brand-new route to one of the mountain's most iconic glaciers on an easy-to-hike trail. Originally a mining road along the Inter Fork of the White River, the route was converted into a trail when the area became a national park. Visitors ranged from climbers accessing the popular Emmons Glacier, to families strolling out of White River campground. Located in close proximity to the dynamic, glacier-fed White River, the original trail was frequently damaged by the river's shifting course. After the floods in 2006, the park elected to build a new trail that was no longer subject to the floods. Thanks to a Herculean effort by WTA volunteers and Mount Rainier National Park (after all, 6,500 feet of trail isn't the easiest task to complete) the 3.25-mile hike up the Inter Fork of the White River is now a breeze. Along the way, you'll pass a half mile side trail heading up Emmons Moraine. This one is worth a detour, as it offers incredible views of Emmons Glacier, the largest sheet of ice on Rainier, and a milky blue-green glacial lake below. Another mile up, pass the junction with the Burroughs Mountain Trail and continue into the Glacier Basin wilderness camp in a forested glen, where six campsites are available, including a group site. Just beyond the camp, Glacier Basin opens up in all its glory, with wide meadows, a large shimmering tarn, and views up The Mountain of The Wedge and Mount Ruth. You'll also see a well-worn climber's trail continuing up to Camps Curtis and Schurman. WTA Pro Tip: Make this a loop trip! Note that this route is quite a bit longer -- clocking in at 11.5 miles and 3100 feet of elevation gain. On the way, you'll summit 7,400 foot Burroughs Mountain, descend to Frozen Lake, then head southeast on the Wonderland Trail through Sunrise Camp and Shadow Lake, then back down to where you started at White River Campground."

This estuary at the saltwater edge of the Skagit River delta is eight miles long and three miles across, and you can walk a portion of it. This hike can be enjoyed by almost anyone in any season. The easy flat walking make this an ideal hike for those just starting to hike, or someone recovering from injury or illness. Birders will definitely want to bring the binoculars! Before you start, be sure to check out the large tree on the road to the trailhead, there is a pair of bald eagles that sometimes hang out here.The name Padilla--which means 'breadpan' in Spanish--was given to the bay by early Spanish explorers, although native people had long taken advantage of the natural abundance of food found here. One of the first features you see as you start your walk is an oft-photographed old barn with some rusting equipment lying about in the mud.  This is a remnant of one of the so called ‘stump farms’, land purchased cheaply after the area was logged in the early 1900s then converted to farming. Much as you may wish to explore the old barn, the timbers are rotten and the barn best left to the swallows. Great blue herons can frequently be seen hunting in the muck around the barn, maybe one will pose for you as you take your barn picture. Continue down the path along Little Indian Slough as you head toward the bay. Watch for northern harriers hunting along the shoreline. Note too, the wild roses along the ditch. In spring you will see and smell the single pink flowers, followed in fall by the bright red hips (fruit). Listen for the songs of the small birds that flit through the thickets. A glance away from the bay reminds you that this is farmland of the Skagit flats, still productive even now. In winter you may see the snow geese that feed in the fields. Is the tide going out or coming in? Watch the current of the water in the slough. At high tide, the water will cover the whole bank. At low tide, the water will be completely gone from the bay, exposing the mudflats. The grass you see growing along the slough is eelgrass, an important native grass harboring small salmon, crab, and other invertebrates that, in turn are food for the eagles, herons, otters and seals.  In about a mile, come to a small promontory. Here comfortable benches welcome you to sit and enjoy the view. Across the bay the large island in the middle is Lummi Island, the top of Mount Baker can be seen over the low hills to the northeast,and to the west is the Anacortes refinery. This is also an important stop along the Pacific flyway, so dig the binoculars out of your knapsack. Sit and watch the ducks dive in the shallow water or the herons feed in the mud. Some winters you may be lucky enough to spy a snowy owl. If you do, consider yourself blessed!Walk along the path for another mile. On this section you will find a large old driftwood stump which is picture worthy on a frosty winter day. Notice the old pilings, and a dock that has since sunk in the mud. When you reach the north entrance look for the old boat crashed on the shore beside the fence. As you walk back, see how far out, or in, the tide has come since you started.WTA Pro Tip: There is so much good scenery in this area, don’t just head home. Stop at Bayview State Park (but be sure to have your Discover Pass) and have a picnic, stop in Edison for some delicious baked goods, or head back past the tulip fields, a nice alternative to the freeway even without the blooming tulips."

Appreciate these trees before climbing into never-logged forests on the ridge between Tumtum Peak and Mount Ararat. Keep climbing steadily from this point on. You're approaching the summit ridge of Mount Ararat, which provides fantastic views of Rainier and the peaceful valley below, but does require a detour. Stay on trail, and about 4 miles from the trailhead, cross a section of hillside meadows that offer lower, but still excellent views northeast to Mount Rainier and south to Satulick Mountain.

Overall, the trail that starts at the White River Road is kinder to your knees than the Kautz Creek access, though there are a couple of washouts that must be skirted by steep trail reroutes, and—with a two-mile road walk before the actual trailhead—this way is considerably longer.If you decide to explore Indian Henry’s Hunting Ground this way, park at the closure of the West Side Road and hike or bike up the road two miles. Wind your way through large boulders, which come down in spring avalanches, and cross two small creeks (one has a bridge, one does not). Carry on via a straightaway that parallels the river until the road bends around to the left, ascending into a green tunnel of trees. This crook is your departure point. Turn right off the road, onto a trail that is largely marked by cairns for the first section. It’s a short forest walk before popping into the riverbed, where you’ll follow a well-marked trail along the edge of the roaring torrent of Tahoma Creek. In spring, this can be quite high; check conditions before heading out. After a half-mile of riverside walking and cairn following, the trail turns left back into the forest. Ascending along the hillside, the trail soon arrives at the first washout. Marvel at the river’s power that took such a large chunk out of the trail, then begin the steep climb up and over. Once past this washout, the trail resumes a moderate uphill grade to the second washout, steeper than the first. Clamber up and over exposed roots and descend sharply back down. Be careful here.After conquering the two washouts, continue on, hiking along a gentle grade at first and then through some switchbacks leading up a ridge. At the top—1.5 miles in—is a sign indicating that you’ve joined the Wonderland Trail. Take the right-hand fork, heading east on the Wonderland before arriving at a suspension bridge spanning Tahoma Creek. Cross the bridge and chug on uphill on the other side. The trail maintains a steady grade for about two miles, leading you up hillsides, through green forest stocked with second-growth hemlocks and cedars, and stunning views of Rainier and the Tahoma Creek drainage and the glaciers that feed it. One final push up and over a ridge puts you in sloping meadows carpeted with huckleberries and laced by little creeks: a precursor to your final destination. Continue on, arriving at a trail junction in Indian Henry’s Hunting Ground, two and a half miles from where you joined the Wonderland Trail. From this junction there are plenty of options for exploration. Take the trail branching to the left to visit Mirror Lake, or continue straight on and arrive at the ranger’s cabin in about a quarter mile. From the cabin, rest up and imagine So-To-Lick living up here, hosting explorers and guiding them up the enormous mountain looming overhead. WTA Pro Tip: Make the trip a thru-hike by continuing on the Wonderland and following the Kautz Creek trail out. Of course, you’ll need to arrange a shuttle in order to do this route, but with the stunning wildflowers and views of Rainier, Adams, St. Helens, and the forests between spread out before you, it’s hard to turn around."

Try it and you’ll find out why.Year-round access from a 500 foot elevation trailhead on a reasonable road ought to help this end of the Tunnel Creek trail see more use than it does. So should the views of Mount Jupiter along the way. But its reputation and a review of the compressed contour lines deter many who should try the trail. Yes, it is steep; picking up 4,550 feet in 3.2 miles (6.4 miles round trip to 5050 Pass). The grade is far from uniform. Some series of climbing turns ascend ridge noses at punishing grades of 35 to 40 percent. More moderate traverses then help your legs and lungs recover and lure hikers forward only to shift into yet another steep stretch.Gamm Creek at about two miles is the only source of water along the south side. A stop here to fill up on water and to view the pleasant waterfalls just above the trail can leave hikers doubly refreshed. About 50 yards past Gamm Creek the trail crosses a 15 yard-wide slide of fine scree. Watch your footing. The trail now mixes steep stretches with slightly lees steep ones. The south-facing slope gradually opens up as you get closer to the cusp of the ridge. From here the trail continues to climb through an undulating set of sub-ridges to 5050 Pass."

A few benches can be found throughout the park.The road itself has a gentle grade, and is in excellent shape, offering a good option for all ages and abilities. In contrast, the trail system is more rugged, although well maintained. Still, areas of mud and rough sections do exist. On top of that the trail network is a maze of intersections which can confuse and disorient a person into frustration, as there are few signs. It's necessary to bring a map if you're going to navigate the trails. Follow this link to the map provided by Kitsap County and print it out for your hike: http://www.kitsapgov.com/parks/Parks/Pages/Trail_Maps.htmIt would be impossible to describe in detail all the trails in the park, but they generally connect to the main route, and wind their way through an airy forest of fir and salal, with here and there a pine or cedar tree. There are also a few old hemlocks, most noticeably along the Mismash trail. However, the middle section of the main route (roughly one mile from either trailhead) passes through a dreary hall of juvenile firs. Compare this section (or avoid it altogether) to the magnificent north central area with its stately trunks, lofty canopy, and lush salal understory dotted with ferns, downed trees, and various fungi.Near the center of Banner Forest lies a protected wetland which is transected by several trails. Please remain on trail in the wetlands as they are fragile. This ""environmental laboratory"" is the centerpiece of the park's conservation efforts, and sharply juxtaposes the working forest (meaning future harvest) that surrounds it. Banner Forest was originally set aside to fund schools through the harvest of its timber. It seemed destined to become a planned neighborhood in the 1990's, but was saved by local action. The trails are now maintained by the volunteers of Banner Forest Stewardship Group.The park's trails are mixed use -- hiking, mountain biking, and horseback riding are all permitted. Dogs are also allowed with the usual etiquette rules. Please don't unleash your dogs here, as black bears occasionally visit the area. A biker was seriously injured here in 2007 when he and his dogs surprised a large bear. If you're riding or running make some noise just as you would in the mountains.The park is popular with mountain bikers, so be sure to keep an eye out whether you are hiking or riding as well.

The trail climbs steeply, but once the work is done, snowshoers can trek along the long ridge stretched between Mount Angeles and Rocky Peak.During warm summer months, the trail switchbacks back and forth steeply up this narrow drainage, covering more than 1.6 miles before attending the ridge top. With a thick blanket of snow, however, snow¬shoers can kick step a more direct route to the top, cutting the climbing distance to about a mile. The downside is that though the route is just a mile long, it climbs more than 1400 feet in elevation. You can either gasp your way through a straight ascent, or sweat yourself through a more moderate-angled and less grueling, but longer, route up. For the best views and clearest route, stay on the right flank of the creek basin and angle east toward the Klahhane Saddle. Once in the saddle, you can turn left and stomp through the wind-stacked snowdrifts along the ridge to the flank of Mount Angeles. Or, for a more leisurely and more scenic trek, turn right and stroll east along the ridge. Be aware that several sections of ridgeline can be heavily corniced--big overhanging drifts of snow--so you need to stay to the center of those sections to avoid collapsing a cornice and starting an avalanche. From this open ridge, you can peer south across the Cox River valley to Hurricane Ridge. The rocky spire of Steeple Rock is due south, and the high summit of Obstruction Point anchors the east end of Hurricane Ridge. Follow the ridge east as far as you care to, then retrace your steps, taking care to descend slowly and carefully.Author’s Rating: More DifficultSome previous snowshoe experience helpful.

Created in 1972 when the Bulitt family donated 590 acres of land at the top of a mountain near Issaquah to the state. The donation included a stipulation that the land must remain in its natural state. Several other parcels of land were acquired over the years, combining to make Squak Mountain the extensive network of trails it is today. Traces of early land users are readily found throughout the park, from remnants of old coal mining rail trails to overgrown logging roads. Massive old-growth stumps dot the forest alongside the trails. The Bullitt fireplace, a popular park destination, is all that remains at the site of the Bullitt's summer home.The most direct route to the summit is to follow the signage for the Central Peak trail, a 3.3-mile distance. In general, proceed towards the higher elevation for the shortest route. There are many side trails that can be taken to add loops and additional viewpoints. Once you reach the Bullitt Fireplace, the summit is only a short distance away. The lower parts of the trail are multi-use; the last 1.6 miles are hiker-only.The park features a self-guided interpretive walk along the .3-mile Pretzel Tree Trail adjacent to the main trailhead.

Canyon Creek Road is narrow, rough, and badly potholed in spots. However, it does offer access to a pleasant and short trail to Excelsior Pass and all that lies beyond. The road is longer but the hike is shorter and has less elevation gain than the route from either end of the High Divide Trail.The trail begins in old-growth forest, thick enough to provide shade but thin enough to allow filtered sunlight in. It gains elevation moderately to a junction with the Canyon Ridge trail at two-thirds of a mile from the trailhead. At the junction, continue straight, then drop slightly as the tree canopy opens to a swampy area holding huckleberry bushes, a small lake, and a couple of ponds: these are the Damfino Lakes.After a quarter mile of flat terrain, you climb again in shady forest until the trail again levels off at just over 5000 feet. At 2.0 miles the forest gives way to rolling meadows and views of Excelsior Pass. Two hundred yards ahead, rock-hop a stream then climb through open meadows the remaining half mile to Excelsior Pass, elevation 5375 feet.

Source Lake is the headwaters of the main branch of the South Fork of the Snoqualmie River system. The waters of this lake run down the Snoqualmie River, flowing alongside Interstate 90 to North Bend, then carving north into the fertile Snoqualmie Valley before merging with the Skykomish River to form the fish-rich Snohomish River. But that's downstream. We are looking for the headwaters here. When planning a trip along this route, be aware that when snow is unstable, avalanche dangers are scary. But when avalanche danger is listed as moderate or lower, the trail to Source Lake makes a wonderful outing for snowshoers. Snowshoers can bask in glorious views of Denny Mountain, The Tooth, Bryant Peak, Chair Peak, and Snoqualmie Mountain. Those with sharp eyes can sometimes spot radical extreme skiers sneaking away from the Alpental Ski Area to launch themselves down the near-vertical snow-laden slopes of these peaks. Those who would rather watch a more natural variety of wildlife can scan the skies to spot red-tailed hawks, golden eagles, ravens, and falcons. Martens, hares, weasels, and squirrels burrow through and scamper over the snow around the trail.When snow levels are low, you can begin the snowshoe trek by either finding the Snow Lake trailhead on the east side of the lower parking lot and following it as it climbs up the slope before looping northwest on a level traverse for 0.5 mile to Source Lake; or go the easier route and, from the upper end of the parking area, snowshoe cross-country up the slope at the base of Snoqualmie Mountain to catch the trail as it passes the ski area. By midwinter when the snows are deep and the brush all well buried, ignore the summer trail and instead head northwest from the ski area, staying on the west side of the river basin. Don't walk in the bottom of the valley--there is a danger of punching through snow and taking a dip in the creek. Rather, stay up above the river course, but stay parallel to it. The route climbs at a gentle pitch up the Snoqualmie River valley, passing through alder thickets, old stands of forest, and open meadows, for a bit more than 1 mile--gaining more than 700 feet along the way--before a final steep pitch of several hundred yards to the lake.The lake is a small, circular tarn at the base of a steep wall below Chair Peak. This is the headwaters of the South Fork Snoqualmie River, although in winter, with its thick ice cap, it looks more like a flat bench than a deep lake. Enjoy a rest and picnic here while soaking in the views of the surrounding panorama. Denny Peak lies to the south, flanked by The Tooth; Bryant Peak and Chair Peak are to the west.

You will be immediately immersed in the serenity of nature, making this the perfect break from city life.Before beginning this hike, take time to enjoy the lake-like backwaters where you may see ducks bobbing or hear frogs croaking. The shared-use paved trail immediately enters a wooded area with a forested slope on the right and views of the creek on the left. You will witness the transition of the creek as it flows downstream through grassy bottomlands to join with the backwaters.After one mile, the trail breaks into a park-like meadow where you can pause and relish the beauty of the scenery. The trail splits just after entering the meadow. You can go either direction, since the two paths rejoin on the other end of the meadow.At 1.3 miles, you will come to a small bridge marking the east end of Steward Glen. The bridge is the turnaround for this hike. If you would like to extend your trip, cross NW Alki Road and follow the greenway through a more residential area."

Otherwise, it’s at least a day’s journey to even get to the trailhead. Agnes Gorge offers views of snow-capped peaks, a traverse along one side of a plunging gorge, and a beautiful riverfront view as your destination. To reach the trailhead, you’ll need to catch the bus from the ferry landing at the north end of Lake Chelan. The bus schedule is posted on the ferry and in Chelan, and it is available in the convenience store at the landing as well. The bus costs $7 per adult to get to the trailhead at High Bridge, and along the way it stops at the legendary Bakery, 342-foot tall Rainbow Falls, and the Stehekin Valley Ranch before arriving at the High Bridge Ranger Station, which is a park housing facility. From High Bridge, cross the bridge, noting the mighty Stehekin River flowing beneath you. Its remarkable opaque blue color is from glacial silt far upstream. Just over the bridge, pass the trailhead for Agnes Creek (a turn down this would make for a many miles long trek on the PCT) and turn left onto the well-marked Agnes Gorge Trail. The trail plunges into cool forest, and after a quarter-mile opens into a hillside traverse, where you’ll get your first look into Agnes Gorge. This hillside traverse continues for about a mile, crossing into the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest 1.25 miles from the trailhead. A creek crossing toward the beginning of the trail may be tricky in springtime or times of high water. WTA has improved the trail here, building the trail up at its end and making it more sustainable. Drainages were installed as well as a rock wall to reinforce a switchback and rock steps to make the tread safer.But before you get to see our handiwork, you’ll take in some of nature’s finest views. Enjoy views of 8,115 foot Agnes Mountain standing guard over the impressive gorge. If you’re hiking late in the season, huckleberries line the slopes to the north here – remember that bears live in the Stehekin valley and you may see some munching away, getting ready for winter. Give them space and let them know you’re around by talking or singing; it’s likely they won’t bother you.After just 2.5 miles, arrive at the end of the trail. It descends to the water here, where you may be able to shed your shoes and socks and cool off your feet, depending on the water level. Relax and listen to powerful Agnes Creek crashing by before returning back the way you came. WTA Pro Tip: Note the time of the last shuttle back to the landing, and be sure to be waiting at High Bridge when it arrives. If you prefer to not be on a bus schedule, consider staying at nearby High Bridge camp – make arrangements to do so with rangers at the Golden West Visitor Center, located just up the hill from the landing."

Summer hikers know the Granite Mountain Trail as a real thigh burner. But as strenuous as the well-trod summer path maybe, it's nothing compared to the snow route up the big mountain. Snowshoers don't have the benefit of the long, looping switchbacks and hillside traverses. Instead, they must climb steeply and fairly directly to the top, gaining more than 3700 feet in about 2.5 miles--or nearly 1500 feet per mile! Take your time, and watch the snow conditions as you climb.The route begins at the summer trailhead for the Granite Mountain Trail, but you won't stick to the trail for long. The winter route climbs nearly due north, staying on the low ridgeline that climbs in a gentle westward arc toward the summit. Avoid drifting east into the obvious--and hazardous--avalanche chute there. The summer hiking trail pierces the heart of that chute, but in winter, snow flushes that valley regularly. Steer clear of it. The safe route climbs steeply from the get-go, passing first through a tight tangle of Douglas fir and cedar trees, then breaking out into open snowfields at about 3500 feet. If you have climbed straight north, you should be nearly due south of the summit at this point. Keep mobbing upward, staying near the spine of the ridge. You might encounter bare rock on this windswept ridgeline, but keep your shoes on for traction since the snow is not gone, just blown somewhere else. As you push up toward the summit, views open and you can enjoy spectacular panoramas to the south and east. Humpback Mountain towers due south, and Mount Catherine sits to the southeast. If you're tired and worried about getting back down before dark, skip the summit and turn around anytime after you break out of the trees.Author’s Rating: BackcountryThese routes follow topography rather than trails or roads. Skill with a map and compass is essential. A variety of conditions may be encountered along backcountry routes, including steep elevation gains and losses. These routes require complete competence in winter survival skills, avalanche and snow condition evaluation and some basic mountaineering skills."

The main property has approximately 1.5 miles of old road bed that serves as a connection between Covington and Maple Valley and will become a regional trail connector in the future. There are also unimproved foot trails that cross the property.The main park site consists of 85 acres of mature forest that was originally owned by Department of Natural Resources and was part of the school trust lands. The last time the property was logged was in the 1930s. Mature forest is unusual in Southeast King County since most lands were tree farms and have been logged numerous times. Mature forest with a multi-storied canopy and trees that were as much as 70 years old mark this unique area. Steep hillsides are abundant with small seeps and springs. Wetlands fill a bench at the northern edge of the property that then feed into one of the large wetland systems left in King County along Jenkins creek. The forest serves as healthy habitat for a wide variety of wildlife including deer, mountain beaver, flying squirrels, raccoons, coyote, and occasionally elk and black bear. Additionally the wetlands are visited by Heron, Red tailed Hawk, eagles, and Osprey.For more info visit Friends of Cedar Creek Park's website at: www.friendsofcedarcreekpark.org"

There is also an optional side trip to visit the Lily Fields, which are infused with purple camas blossoms from mid-April to mid-May. Although there are some heart-thumping uphill sections, the hike is generally easy and appropriate for reasonably fit people of all ages. There is a labyrinth of trails in the park, and it’s easy to end up someplace you didn’t intend to go.

In about 0.3 miles, you will come to a screening device and a dam. The screening device was built to keep fish and debris out of the water supply for the paper mill, and the dam serves as Lacamas Creek’s outlet from the lake. Cross the screening device and then the dam, ignoring side trails to the right until after you cross the dam. After the dam, skip the primitive trail to the right and continue on to the second trail to the right. This 0.6 mile unmarked trail will take you to the Pothole Falls Overlook and then on to Lower Falls. When the water is low in the summer, Pothole Falls has some interesting geological features. You can see a pair of round pools and weirdly pockmarked bedrock. Floodwaters created the curving, smooth shapes by swirling rocks in depressions in the soft rock. After checking out Pothole Falls, return to the trail and continue downstream to Lower Falls. The trail follows the creek from the top of a ravine before dipping into a lightly forested area with small streams. The trail then rejoins Lacamas Creek where you are treated with the sights and sounds water cascading over rocks. Ignore side trails and keep on this trail until you come to a picturesque wooden bridge crossing the creek at the top of Lower Falls. Although this hike doesn’t include the bridge, it is worth taking some time to explore here. Cross the bridge to take in the falls from the top and perhaps stop at the picnic area on the west side of the creek for a snack. You may also want to take a side-trail downstream on the east side of the creek to experience the full impact of the water tumbling over the falls. After exploring the falls, return to the east side of the creek and go uphill on a wide hard-surfaced path. You will soon come to a junction with signs pointing to Round Lake and to an access road. Go towards Round Lake. You will then come to two dirt trails to the left. Skip the first one, and take the second one, which has a small marker indicating it goes to Round Lake. This 0.4 mile shortcut is much more peaceful than continuing on the main path. The trail enters a forest with bracken and sword ferns in the understory and cedar and vine maples overhead. Ignore side trails and stay on the main trail. When you come to another hard-surface trail, turn left to return to Round Lake. Along the way, you will see signs for the Camas Lily Fields loop on the right. If you would like explore the loop, turn right at the first sign. The 0.7 mile Lily Fields loop climbs up a hillside, then dips into and out of forested areas and meadows where the camas lilies blossoms are resplendent mid-April to mid-May. If you would like to skip the Lily Fields, continue on the hard-surface trail to the second sign for the Camas Lily Fields. Turn right for the scenic shortcut path to the Round Lake Loop Trail. You will come to a junction with the Round Lake Loop trail, which is also where the optional Lily Fields side trip ends. Turn right and follow the hard-surfaced trail 0.7 mile to the trailhead on 35th Avenue.

You may also want to venture into Camas for a treat at Burgerville or a microbrew at the Mill City Brew Works."

A quarter mile farther brings you alongside Siouxon Creek Falls, a 40-foot plunge down a narrow S-shaped cleft. Two campsites and a small, primitive shelter can be found opposite the falls; a short side trail above the falls allows for water access.Continue up the canyon for 2 more miles to a wide stream cascading across the trail. Use caution on the slick rocks during the early season high runoff. Just beyond the crossing, fork left over another wooden bridge, this time over a deep gorge cut through the rock. Now along Chinook Creek, pass a couple more campsites, and arrive at 50-foot Chinook Creek Falls. A ford is required to connect to the other side of the trail to continue on to Huffman and Siouxon Peaks, so this makes an ideal lunch and turnaround spot below the misty falls."

Perfect for exploring children, curious adults, an extra add-on after a longer hike, or a leg stretch during a driving tour of the area. The somewhat unusually named plant grows along this trail during late summer and autumn, when new growth (youth) burst forth from the base of the older, more established (age) parts of the plant. While the trails name springs from this particular plant, evidence of new growth bursting from older specimens abounds on this trail. And you can explore it all in less than half a mile. The way is paved, but because of roots pushing through the ground and sandy soil, it is not particularly wheelchair-friendly. If you're navigating with a wheelchair or stroller, you'll need a sturdy one, and someone to give you a helping hand in sections. However, interpretive signs dot the trail and provide a nice education about the area, as well as the plants and animals that call this forest home. Look in particular for evidence of erosion by the mighty Stillaguamish River here, and, in addition to the eponymous youth-on-age, Douglas fir, Sitka spruce, and Washington's state tree, the western hemlock."

That is a blessing to those who know of, and take advantage of, the beauty of this secluded little forest valley. The crowds skip over this trail because there are no high, windswept ridges to explore and no deep alpine lake basins in which to camp. But there is a narrow, winding trail that is loads of fun to follow on snowshoes, a rich forest ecosystem to explore, and a host of wildlife to view and appreciate. (In low-snow years, it may be necessary to carry the snowshoes on the lower section of trail, but the upper valley is generally deep in snow by mid-December.)The trail climbs steadily from the highway, staying well above the creek itself for the first mile. The views are limited to the local forest scenery, but that is rich enough to hold anyone's attention. Of course, there's not a lot of time for gawking, as this narrow, under-maintained trail is rough and, with a blanket of snow on it, avoiding snowshoe-tearing branches and toe-grabbing logs requires undivided attention at times. At other times, however, the trail is open and easily followed. These stretches--especially past the 1-mile mark--are where the views can be best appreciated. After the initial 1.5 miles, the trail stops climbing and rolls into a long traverse of the ridge wall above the creek, dipping at times to water level before angling back up into the open forest above. Around 2.5 miles, the trail angles left toward the head of the valley. It continues another 0.8 mile before the formal trail peters out.It's possible, when the snow is stable, to continue up the valley for another 0.5 mile to get right under the shadow of the near-vertical headwall. Just don't get too close, as avalanches aren't the only danger here. Rockfalls are much more common than snowslides, and just as deadly. If the weather is warming, or the avalanche danger is moderate or great, don't push past the end of the formal trail.Because the creek valley is relatively wide-bottomed with plenty of lush undergrowth for forage, it's common for deer to be found in this area. And where there are deer, there are cougars. Count yourself lucky if you see one of these big, elusive cats. Usually the only proof that mountain lions exist in these woods comes in the form of deep, clawless tracks pressed into the snow.Big animals aren't the only inhabitants here. Grouse roost in the trees near the creek, snowshoe hares scamper through the underbrush along the trail, and at least one great horned owl glides silently between the trees looking for a midwinter meal of rabbit, vole, or marten. Yes, the creek is aptly named - martens have also been seen along this pretty trail.Author’s Rating: BackcountryThese routes follow topography rather than trails or roads. Skill with a map and compass is essential. A variety of conditions may be encountered along backcountry routes, including steep elevation gains and losses. These routes require complete competence in winter survival skills, avalanche and snow condition evaluation and some basic mountaineering skills."

The full trail loop provides fantastic views of the Columbia River Gorge, an intimate look at the Cape Horn Falls and a challenging workout as it climbs and descends the rocky slopes of Cape Horn.The entire loop is made up of two segments separated by Hwy 14; each are mostly single track, but also include stretches of road where the trail is incomplete.  The description here is a general overview of the loop in a counter-clockwise direction. In some places the route is hard to discern especially where it joins or leaves a road, or where an old segment has been abandoned in favor of a different route. If you have hiked this route before, be a friend and take someone out there who hasn’t so they can find the way. Guided hikes are often offered by the Mazamas, Friends of the Columbia River Gorge and the Mt. St. Helens Club.The main parking area is the Skamania County Public Transit Park and Ride at the intersection of Salmon Falls Road and Hwy 14. The upper trail begins on the west side of the parking lot, on the opposite side of Salmon Falls Road. From there the trail ascends several steep switchbacks, then traverses west and south past scenic views of Hamilton Mountain, Beacon Rock and the Gorge.The hardest part to navigate is where the trail follows a road. this happens twice. First after a short descent from Pioneer Point. And again after crossing Strunk Rd at its dead end where you follow a gravel road south to the Cape Horn summit, former site of a large home that has since been deconstructed. The Friends of the Gorge funded the construction of an overlook platform in honer of their founder, Nancy Russell, who helped to protect the site for the public to enjoy.It then descends back to Hwy 14 just west of Cape Horn.The lower segment picks up on the opposite side of the Hwy. Crossing the Hwy is much safer now that the Pedestrian underpasses have been built. The lower trail continues to the west passing more cliff top view points before descending mossy talus slopes, then turning eastward. From Feb. 1 until July 15th, the lower segment is closed at a viewpoint just before the decent. This closure is for nesting Peregrine falcons. The trail passes Cape Horn Falls, then traverses a some steep side slopes and rocky outcrops ending at Cape Horn Road. The last 1.3 miles of the route are on Cape Horn Road back to the Park and Ride.Be advised that this trail has not yet been constructed to typical Forest Service trail standards so be prepared for steep, rocky terrain, particularly on the lower section.  Some of the viewpoints have precipitous drops that are not recommended for the faint of heart. For a shorter hike try the upper trail going out-and-back from the parking area to the Nancy Russell Overlook.Since the trail was only recently made official, it does not appear on Forest Service maps. Follow this link to a map that shows the general location of the trail: www.capehorntrail.org/trailmap.html/. Note also that to minimize disturbance to nesting peregrine falcons, the lower portion of the trail is closed. In 2011 the closure dates were modified to February 1 - July 15.BackgroundIn the early 1980's Friends of the Gorge founder Nancy Russell was so inspired by the sweeping vista from atop Cape Horn that she embarked on a 20 year effort to protect the area for all the public to enjoy. Bruce and Nancy Russell purchased land originally slated to become a private subdivision and worked with the Trust for Public Lands to convey the land to the Forest Service.Additional parcels were similarly acquired and transferred as the Friends of the Gorge worked in partnership with the Columbia Land Trust, Trust for Public Lands and the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area.Today the Forest Service owns nearly all the land that the trail is on with the exception of two small sections of trail that are in easements. In addition to gaining a substantial amount of land, the Forest Service also acquired a user-built trail. Prior to sanctioning the already popular trail, the Forest Service completed a lengthy planning process in an effort to balance the trail's outstanding recreational value with its potential impacts on sensitive species such as peregrine falcons and Larch Mt. salamanders.As a result of that plan completed in early 2010, the Cape Horn Trail is scheduled to undergo a number of upgrades to bring it to Forest Service standards for sustainability and safety. As well some sections will be rerouted away from important habitat areas or closed seasonally for nesting falcons."

The beautifully shaped Mount Shuksan is the star of the area, with a gorgeous summit pyramid and several impressive glaciers. Mount Baker dominates the skyline in the southwest. Artist Point also is a great viewpoint for the Cascades, with sweeping views of the valley of Baker Lake and in the far distance peaks like Whitehorse Mountain, Three Fingers, Sloan Peak and White Chuck Mountain. Immediately from the trailhead beautiful peaks in the north are visible, such as American Border Peak, Mount Larrabee, and Goat Mountain.Artist Point is an excellent winter destination. The area typically gets large amounts of snow: it even holds the world record amount of snowfall within a season (95 feet). Due to its northern location and a trailhead at 4200 feet, good snow coverage is virtually guaranteed from November to June. In average years, cars can drive all the way to the Artist Point parking area from July until late September, but the remainder of the year the Mount Baker Highway is only plowed to the ski area at Heather Meadows (Picture Lake). In extreme years like 1999, the last section to Artist Point might not open at all. The ski area is small and isolated enough that it does not disturb the peace and quiet at Artist Point, and helps with winter access to this beautiful place.Artist Point is a 4-mile roundtrip snowshoe with about 1000 feet of elevation gain. It is a popular destination, so there is almost always a clearly visible track to follow. Artist Point should be doable for most beginning snowshoers, but there are a couple of steeper (though not exposed) sections that can be challenging depending on the snow conditions. If you venture out with fog or snow in the forecast, then be cautious that route finding skills are critical in this open terrain.The route to Artist Point does go through avalanche terrain, so this trip is not without danger. Depending on the specific risks, it is best to avoid the area when avalanche risk is considerable. Please carefully consider the NWAC avalanche forecast before venturing out (updated every night at 6pm). By carefully picking your route the steepest terrain and the more dangerous avalanche slopes can be avoided, but this requires experience with route finding and snow conditions. The trailhead to Artist Point is at the last parking area on the Mount Baker Highway. No permits nor payment are required. The arrival at Heather Meadows can be a bit confusing due to all the activity at the ski area. Upon arrival at Heather Meadows, continue to drive around Picture Lake (one-way) and past the ski lifts. The large parking area is on the right at the end of the road. The trail begins left of the bathroom facilities. Initially there are typically various tracks in the open, relatively flat terrain outside of the ski area. Depending on the route that you choose, after half a mile there are a few large cabins. At this point, head more uphill to the Austin Pass. During this climb (which gets a bit steeper), there is only a single track, which follows exactly the ski area boundary, which is clearly marked (do not enter the ski area). During this first section of the trip, there is no view of Mount Baker nor Mount Shuksan. Both are hiding behind various arms, but there are already gorgeous views to border with Canada and on the north-face of Table Mountain. Note that you should not follow the road to the Austin Pass. This road is in the ski area, and even if the ski area is not yet open, it is steep terrain with avalanche risk.From Austin Pass, head southwest towards Artist Point. Again, there are many ways to get there. The direct route that avoids losing elevation is a bit steep. It is a rewarding trip to descend a bit into the wide open terrain, just below the summer road (which is usually not recognizable). The final climb to Artist Point is a bit steeper again, and flattens out into a beautiful slightly hilly area, which is where the summer parking area is hiding. With average snow levels, the outhouse of the Artist Point summer parking area is usually not visible at all, but it is fun to try to find it.Mount Baker has been a tease so far: only now does it become visible, with the Ptarmigan Ridge leading to Baker from Table Mountain. Mount Shuksan to the northeast has two large arms, the Shuksan Arm to the west, and an arm to Mount Ann to the south. The Mount Ann arm obscures the views to the North Cascades, but the views on the Central Cascades are rewarding. In the valley to the south, parts of Baker Lake are visible.From Artist Point a short side-trip of 1.5 miles roundtrip to Huntoon Point is a great way of taking in more of the scenery. This point is the natural eastern turnaround point on the Kulshan Ridge, which Artist Point is a part of as well.It also possible to considerably extend your trip to eight miles by circumnavigating Table Mountain via the Chain Lakes (Iceberg Lake, Mazama Lake), but be extremely cautious about the south-facing slope of Table Mountain. This slope is very avalanche-prone and should be avoided if there is any risk of avalanches. A short side-trip to Bagley Lakes at the trailhead is another way to extend your trip, but be aware that this area is more exposed to avalanche risk as well.On the drive back home it is worth stopping at the Nooksack Falls, which is a short walk only, and usually has a nice volume of water."

From Rachel Lake you can access further adventures at Rampart Lake, Lila Lake and Alta Peak. This hike is a popular weekend overnight destination; so don’t expect to be by yourself in high season. The trail starts off heading uphill before you cross into the wilderness boundary. Some roots and rocks will be present, but it's just enough to get you warmed up. Once you cross the boundary into the Alpine Lakes Wilderness, the trail grade eases. You will cross numerous small feeder streams as you wind your way up a box canyon. The trail alternates between sections of old-growth, primarily douglas fir and hemlock, and brushy avalanche meadows, where the trail is crowded by salmonberry, saw-ferns and devil's club. If you hike this section after an overnight rain or a dewy morning, prepare to get your legs more than a little damp.Two and three quarters of a mile in, the trail changes character. Cross Canyon Creek, the main stream you have been following up the valley and begin the earnest climb up to Rachel Lake. This section of trail is heavily rooted, with many large step-ups; to call it a trail is being generous. Though you travel only a mile, you'll gain 1200 vertical feet in this section. As you climb, you'll find distraction as you cross under a beautiful cascade where one of the many small streams cascades down a rock wall above you. Halfway up, you'll start getting great views back down Box Canyon. There are a number of false trails along the way, most of which have been blocked off with crossed sticks. Consult your map often and take heart; it will all be worth it when you top out at Rachel.There are a number of campsites at the lake. Bearing right, the trail skirts the lake and then heads up an additional 600 vertical feet to Rampart Ridge. By comparison to what you just hiked, this section is in excellent shape--well constructed with switchbacks and no big step ups. There  are fabulous views from this trail back down on Rachel Lake. Half a mile gets you to the ridge where you can go left 1 mile to Rampart Lakes, or right three-quarters of a mile to Lila Lake and Alta Peak. There is a sign, but it is set back a bit from the trail in an area that looks like a campsite. If you only have time for one add on, go to Rampart Lakes. Rampart Ridge is in the huckleberry zone, so there will be lots of good snacking in August and beautiful colors in mid-September."

This is an often steep, airy climb with many interesting basalt outcrops and increasing views reminiscent of an alpine ridge walk in the Cascades. Point 3582 sits out from the main bulk of Mount Cleman and has wonderful views over the orchards of Naches Heights and the Naches Valley, out to Mount Adams, Nelson Ridge and Rainier, down into Waterworks and Meystre Canyons and back to Mount Cleman itself. Clearly, it makes a great lunch spot.To continue the loop, drop into the saddle between Point 3582 and Mount Cleman. At the north end of the saddle, find the cairned trail traversing to the left down into the canyon. Once on the canyon bottom, turn left and follow the well-defined boot trail that will take you back to your car at the mouth of the canyon.WTA Pro Tip: If you just want to go up the canyon, go through the gate in the elk fence and find the well-defined boot trail to the right a few yards up the old fire road. Be sure to keep to the right when the canyon forks."

Stow your snowshoes so the sharp edges don't poke your partners. Snowshoers must travel single file on the roadway sections. Skiers and boarders have the right-of-way and can be travelling fast. The downhill side of the road works best and gives the skiers the most room to set up their turns.The farthest safe area is that meadow noted in the description.

Amid streams and waterfalls swelled winter’s runoff, you’re sure to forget the quaint Camas downtown is but a few minutes away. The park has a diverse mix of interconnected trails that can be linked together in many different ways. For this hike, start from the 3rd Avenue trailhead. If you’re not paying close attention, it’s easy to drive right by and never know this hidden little oasis exists here. Right away, the path parallels Lacamas Creek, often busy with blue herons, standing like statues hunting their next meal. The path is wide and graveled with some rolling ups and downs as it works its way to a picnic spot and Lower Falls. Watch for mushrooms in the forest duff. Cross the bridge, where the trail splits, hiking in a counter clockwise loop will take you uphill for roughly 50% of the excursion, saving the best of the sights for last. Follow the trail, here an old gravel road, taking time to explore the small offshoots. While the main loop trail is open to bikes, the side trails are hiker-only and are clearly marked. As you approach Round Lake, veer off to the left, skirting the southwest section of the lake, where the path narrows again as it winds against the steep shore. You’ll see where it leads up to the small dam and towards the main entrance (main parking lot/restrooms/playground/picnic areas). Rather, take the junction to hike back southeast, following Lacamas Creek and peering down at The Potholes from above. The pools and rock in this area are an interesting feature of the 312-acre park, but also easy to pass by, so keep your eyes on the water as you pass through this section. If the sun peeks out during this time of year, it is likely to do so here, where the trees are a bit open and the angle right for soaking up some sunbeams. From here, the trail continues, narrow and winding, often muddy in the winter months, as it enters an area of cedar and lush vegetation. Remember, this is a quick outing, so just as the going gets really good, you’ll find yourself back at the bridge at Lower Falls. Turning right, follow the wide path back to the trailhead."

A loop hike with many fabulous changing faces throughout the seasons, Heather-Maple Pass features ridgelines blanketed in wildflowers in summer, lakes ringed with golden larches in fall, and before the highway closes for the season, a dramatic place to experience early winter’s snows.The trail heading counter-clockwise leaves immediately from the parking lot, heading uphill moderately through second-growth forest and dappled sunlight. After about 1.25 miles, a trail branches left to Lake Ann, a jewel cradled in a talus bowl, a glacial cirque created in eons past. The detour is a relatively flat 0.6 miles round trip and well-worth it. Stopping by the shore of Lake Ann affords you a view of the pass that you're headed to. Be sure to note the forces of glaciation and landslides which have created it and the large island within it.Back on the main trail, you'll traverse above Lake Ann, traversing through swathes of wildflowers before reaching Heather Pass, about three-quarters of a mile past the Lake Ann turnoff. From Heather Pass there are social trails which meander through meadows to the north. These are routes that cross-country hikers and climbers use to visit Lewis and Wing Lakes, Black Peak, and beyond. But views from the trail itself are stunning enough.Now redirect yourself, following the trail as it heads left on the ridgeline and continue upward towards Maple Pass. Note that this section of the trail crosses a steep hillside that can retain snow until late in the season.  Gaining the ridge, the edge of the North Cascades National Park is evident by prominent park signs. Wander, gaze, luxuriate, and thrill at the views, both at your feet and off to the horizon. Watch for ptarmigans and their young roosts. Nearby mountains include Corteo, Frisco, Goode, Stiletto, Black Peak and many more. A bit more distant is the stately Liberty Bell group beckoning. And then past that, a sea of peaks stretches out in every direction as far as your imagination can hike. All too soon this glorious loop starts switch-backing downwards. Luckily, the views  continue unabated. The trail picks up speed through the forest. The last 2.5 miles drops about 1700 feet on pretty sound tread. When the trail finally pops out onto a paved ADA-accessible path, turn left and you’ve got just one half mile to your car.If you decide to hike the trail heading clockwise, set out from the southern end of the parking lot, along a paved trail which travels the trail that also leads to Rainy Lake, a nice detour or alternate destination for those with a group of varying hiking abilities. One-half mile along this trail, arrive at a fork and take the right branch, turning uphill. Continuing straight would take you another 0.6 miles to Rainy Lake.From the fork, hike uphill along your first switchback. The way is quite gradual, but gains elevation steadily through avalanche paths and mature woods. Continue climbing as you switchback a few times through hillsides awash in penstemon, Indian paintbrush, monkeyflower, sitka valerian and more, until you arrive in Maple Pass, with its stunning views of Black Peak and North Cascades National Park. Your descent is more gradual, sweeping along the loop as it arcs east, down to the junction with Lake Ann. If you've got time, take the detour for Lake Ann. If not, the parking lot is a little more than a mile further on.WTA Pro Tip: One can debate the merits of hiking this loop either clockwise or counter-clockwise. Going clockwise, one reaps the benefit of getting the steep part of the trail out of the way early in the day and a more gradual descent at day’s end, while a counter-clockwise hike offers ever more dramatic views of Black Peak and the North Cascades National Park as you climb to the pass. But at the end of the day, you will be in awe of the area no matter which way you elect to go."

What many hikers don't realize is that it was once twice as long. The road delivering them to the trailhead severed it in two. Good news, though, the entire trail still exists, the eastern 6 miles now known as the Lower Big Quilcene Trail. And although not in the Buckhorn Wilderness, it's still quite wild in places. Much of the route runs through a rugged canyon cloaked in primeval forest. And while past logging has eaten away at the periphery, plenty of ancient groves grace the way.Starting at an elevation of 1400 feet, the Lower Big Quilcene River Trail climbs a mere 1200 feet in its entire 6.2-mile journey. Besides making for an easy trek, the low elevation is ideal for an early-season hike. But if you wait until early summer, you'll be rewarded with blooming rhododendrons. The trail passes by old camp and shelter sites, testaments to when there was no shorter option to Marmot Pass.A good day-hike objective is Camp Jolley, 5 miles out. But hikers not intent on putting in that many miles can cut their hike in half by opting for Bark Shanty Camp. No matter how far you venture, the Lower Big Quilcene offers one of the best low-country valley hikes in the eastern Olympics.The trail starts high above the river on an old roadbed. Walking is fast and easy on this well-groomed and well-graded path. After a slight descent in the first mile the trail enters a steep-walled canyon. After another mile the trail finally meets up with the roaring river, crossing it on a good bridge. Along the rushing waterway and through beautiful groves of towering old growth, reach Bark Shanty Camp at 2.6 miles, a great place to stare at the rapids or cut some z's under an ancient tree.The trail continues, however, recrossing the river and heading farther up the valley. Just beyond the old wooden bridge is the western terminus of the Notch Pass Trail. Continue through a series of old rapidly recovering clear-cuts , and then at 4 miles enter the forest primeval once more. Keep your boots dry crossing a series of side creeks, and at 5 miles arrive at Camp Jolley. Take a break by bubbly Jolley Creek before happily making your way back to the trailhead."

The absolute elevation gain is minimal, but all of those ups and downs add up to more than 3000 feet.

At the top you will cross Goodman Creek, which runs high in spring. Back down on the beach is a lonely stretch of sand - you'll likely have it to yourself. Finally, the last stretch requires waiting for low tide or heading up high to avoid the crashing waves - avoid round Hoh Head in any condition.

After the first uphill climb, reach the top and a break in the trees. Here there will be some way paths leading to views over the ridge. Take in the views, then descend gradually and the trees begin the thin out. Some ‘peek-a-boo’ views of the nearby mountains can now be glimpsed through the gaps in the forest. Follow the trail as it meanders gently up and down along the ridgeline, then arrive at a little meadow filled with lupine and heather. Can you smell it? On warm days, blooming lupine perfumes the trail. Once past the meadow, be on the lookout for an unmarked, but obvious trail taking off steeply to the left at about two miles. There may or may not be a cairn at this junction, which is for the trail to Mount Sawyer. Great views and more wildflower meadows await you here. Like any self-respecting trail to a peak, this one begins steeply and traverses across the south side on its way up. As it reaches the summit, it circles around to the north side, becoming very narrow and hard to follow through the heather and white rhododendron, beautiful if in bloom.Try not to step on the plants. Find rocks and worn tread to take you to the top. There is a geological survey marker giving the elevation at the summit: 5,495 feet. Once at the top, it’s three hundred and sixty degrees of Cascade Mountains! Glacier Peak is to the north and just to the west of it is Mt Baker poking up in the distance. Mount Rainier is to the south, Mount Baring to the west, plus close-ups of Hinman, Daniel and other Alpine Lake peaks. How many can you identify? Look to the east and see Stevens Pass curving through the valley and the eastern Cascades in the background. Wow! Once you are done feasting on the views, it may be time to head downward to look for a lunch spot. Meet the main trail and follow it another mile to Sawyer Pass. A flat open area amid the trees, there are some nice lunch logs and a few places to camp. Enjoy your lunch amid the heather and huckleberries, but bring water. Once the snow melts there is no water on this trail. A trail sign indicates the main trail continues down to Deception Creek. To the right is an unmarked side trail which leads to a few dead ends, then wanders around a bit before becoming a brushy, unmaintained trail down to Fisher Lake.

As you hike, the way is shaded and there is the thick forest duff of moss and humus, with nurse logs growing hemlock and huckleberries. Look for some of the plants that prefer these growing conditions. Early season you will see trillium. After trillium, come some interesting saprophytes. They do not make their own chlorophyll, but take the nutrients they need from nearby tree roots. Pinesap and pinedrops look very similar, with orange stems and yellow bell like flowers. Coralroot, another saprophyte, is a member of the orchid family and has tiny orchid like flowers either pink, white with spots, or striped.

Along with the tarns, these beautiful wet meadows bloom with both pink and white mountain heather, violets, and marsh marigolds. Watch for a trail leading off toward the cliff. Take this short detour for some nice views of Whitechuck Mountain, Mount Pugh and Dome Peak. The big snowcapped mountain in the distance is Shuksan, not Baker. Keep a hand on children and dogs. Once you have soaked in the views, head back, and follow the trail to the ridge above the lake. The trail to the lake is just a steep bootpath descending about 300 feet and was never really a constructed trail. Once at the lake, there are a few nice campsites at the end of the trail. The lake is surrounded by forest, and there is no trail around it. Enjoy a pleasant afternoon of swimming, fishing, or just relaxing.

The elevated path gently meanders through the understory, gaining little elevation as you continue onward.Pass through an area called Ahlstrom’s Prairie at 2.25 miles. This giant, soggy meadow was once farmed by two Swedish immigrants who filled the 160-acre bog with sheep, cattle, and vegetable gardens. Today, any evidence of the farming has given way to native plant and animal life.The roar and smell of the ocean becomes unmistakable as you approach the wild coast of Cape Alava. At 3.3 miles, arrive at the beach and enjoy the views and creatures that live in this isolated place. Tskawahyah Island is not far off, standing as a giant rock guardian complete with freestanding trees adorning the top. Watch the winter sun sink lower in the sky and return the way you came."

Ducks and geese stop here during their annual migrations, and some actually winter here (they end their southern migration here since there is good feed among the farm fields outside the wildlife area and good cover and protected habitat on the lake). That means winter, despite the chill (okay, frigid blast), is a splendid time to visit the region."

They're beautiful birds if you can get close enough to see them.Found near Lower Granite Dam on the Snake River's northern shore, Boyer Park is primarily a day-use park for boaters (thanks to a well-maintained boat launch) and sun worshippers, who lie out on the manicured grass lawns near the boat launch.Hikers can quickly leave the sedentary recreationists behind by heading out on the 2-mile paved trail that follows the shoreline back to where the road comes down off the Palouse highlands.

You’ll remain in forest for the first mile before arriving at placid Twin Lakes. Several campsites dot the northern shores of this lake, and the main trail winds through these sites around to the east (left) of the lakes. Once you're past the campground, you’ll be wading through head-high devils club and heavy brush. This section of the hike is the Cold Creek Trail, and it's by far the worst section of this trail – having a little bit of route-finding knowledge will be extremely helpful, since several trees are down across the trail, and one or two are taking up significant portions of the trail. After braving this steeply switchbacking trail for 1.5 miles, you are rewarded by the junction with the Pacific Crest Trail. This beautifully groomed trail is a welcome sight after the jungle of Cold Creek. At the junction, head west (right). You’re hiking under Tinkham Peak’s formidable summit block, and will soon arrive at a small tarn, about half a mile from the junction with Cold Creek. Just a few hundred feet past this tarn is the turnoff for Silver Peak, the pyramid point that’s been in your line of sight while hiking on the PCT. Take the turnoff if you wish, but know that it’s a steep slog up to Silver Peak, though it’s only a mile to the summit. On the main trail, continue along the PCT, climbing for a little more than another half mile to Windy Pass, where the terrain becomes increasingly tame, finally popping out at the pass in an old clearcut. Many cars may be parked here, since Silver Peak is a popular day hike destination, as is Mount Catherine on the other side of the road.

The catch: you’d better have a high clearance vehicle, because you have to drive one of the worst roads in the state of Washington to access it. From the large trailhead parking area, begin climbing on doubletrack. Most of the trail follows this doubletrack, once an old roadbed. This allows you and your hiking companions to chat easily, but also gives you a wide open area with which to take in views all around you. To your left is the treed ridge of Starway, a brutal bushwhack from the north side, but actually decently accessible from the Silver Star Trail, should you wish to extend your hike.To your right, the Yacolt Burn State Forest and several logging areas unfold in a patchwork quilt of verdant green and brown. Far in the distance, the towns of Longview and Vancouver can be discerned, and on a clear day, the Oregon Coast Range may even be visible. Follow the doubletrack to a flat overlook into the valley between Silver Star and Starway. As it switchbacks, a junction appears to your left. The trail branching off is Ed’s Trail, an alternate route around the north side of a small knoll. Ed’s Trail is a slightly more advanced route – be sure to have trekking poles and confidence in your footing should you adventure this way. Back on the main trail, hike around the south side of a small summit and continue past a saddle. The trail dips down a bit, then begins climbing again on even rockier terrain. You’ve left the wide-open views and now are hiking through close-in second growth forest, though still on doubletrack. About two miles from the trailhead, come to a junction. Ed’s Trail joins this junction to your left, while another wider trail branches off. This is the trail that allows access to Starway and other futher wanderings. Be sure and consult your map to see what your options are. The Silver Star Summit trail stretches ahead of you, indicating the summit is only 0.1 miles away. But be warned, it’s a steep last leg, almost a climbing scramble. But it’s well worth it. From the 4300-foot summit, you’ll have views in all directions.

The trail heads off just behind the kiosk, and bends west, meandering through a wide lahar (outflow from St. Helens’ 1980 explosion and subsequent flood). All around you is a ghost forest of dead trees and gray ash and rock, but a small creek, Coldspring Creek, flows through this valley bottom, and fireweed blooms nearby. Follow signs for the Toutle Trail on a westerly course to a crossing of Coldspring Creek about a mile from the trailhead. The crossing is done on downed logs across the creek; trekking poles here will help. Once across, the trail abruptly enters forest, transitioning from the gray of the lahar to deep greens and browns of old- and second-growth forest.

It now may be best known for Tillicum Village, a Native American re-enactment retreat accessible via ferry from nearby Seattle. There is plenty in store for those who venture over to experience the salmon bake and Native American dances, but few take advantage of the eight miles of hiking trails and camping available here.  The island was not always publicly accessible. For a time in the early 1900s, it was the private estate of William Pitt Trimble, who purchased the entire island. His wife Cassandra cared for it as a garden and by 1917, Trimble and his family lived on the island nearly fulltime. However, in 1929, an accident in Seattle killed Cassandra and Trimble abandoned the island. A fire during World War II destroyed the Trimble Mansion, but foundations are still visible just behind the large building that houses Tillicum Village. If you elect to wander the trails on the island, you’ll find yourself on a wide path – enough for more than two people to walk side by side – and you may see mountain bike tracks. Most of the trails here are open to mountain bikes, so be aware of possible traffic on trail.The trail circumnavigates the island beneath madronas and salal. About a half mile west of Tillicum Village is a small intersection with a port-a-potty. Be warned, this unit is infrequently serviced; you may have better luck in the surrounding vegetation, but look out for nettles!Continuing on, begin to see the campsites along the west edge of the island. Because most people access the island from the Argosy ferry, you will not need a Discover Pass, but if you are visiting here via a private boat, a daily moorage fee is required, as is a camping fee, payable at one of two payment stations on the island. If you want to add a little mileage to your day, head up and over the hill on either the Red or Blue trail. These give you a little elevation gain, but can be muddy, and there’s not much of a view from the summit."

Nestled amid a quiet neighborhood of horse ranches and single-family homes, this 482-acre park has served largely as an equestrian recreation area since the 1950s. The winding, forested trails have also proven to be popular with other trail users, namely hikers, trail runners and dog walkers. Routes wind through a sea of second-growth trees standing at attention under which lush ferns carpet the forest floor. The three main loop trails offer varying lengths of casual forest strolling: the mile-long Raven Trail, the interpretive Trillium Trail (1.7 miles) and the Coyote Trail (3.5 miles). The minimal elevation gain also makes these trails extremely kid-friendly. All three loop trails start from a central junction just a short walk from the main parking area. The Coyote Trail starts in tandem with the Trillium Trail for the first half mile, then forks to the left at an intersection. It continues to loop the perimeter of the park, offering a good opportunity to stretch your legs and fully enjoy the park's flora and fauna. Under western redcedar and other conifers, look for Oregon grape, spotted coralroot and Himalayan blackberry. A variety of birds—from hummingbirds to eagles— can be observed within the forest canopy. The Coyote Trail eventually loops back to the central junction and parking area, where you can explore the smaller loops or visit the horse training ring.WTA Pro Tip: Work the trails in a clockwise direction so that the trail symbol signs face you throughout your hike. They’re only attached to one side of the posts and can be easy to miss if going the opposite direction."

Look down on the beach, then across the water for views of the Olympic Mountains. On a foggy day, listen for the buoy just off the shoreline, or watch for marine life offshore. You may be hoping to spot a whale, but what you will probably see are large container ships and tugboats towing barges. Keep heading south, and take note; you are walking along the Pacific Northwest Trail, an epic trail that runs east to west from the Rocky Mountains west to the Washington coast. In a mile, you will come to the sight of the Fort Ebey bunkers and gun locations. The fort was built in 1942 as a World War Two coastal defense to protect Puget Sound, but luckily it was only used for practice. The bunkers are open to explore, but be sure to bring a flashlight. In front of the bunker site is a nice open grassy area that ends in a sheer drop off. The spot is popular for paragliders. Have fun watching the gliders, or continue on the trail heading up on the bluff. The trail climbs up and across the bluff, alternating between the open bluff and salal filled woodland edge.  This is your high point, with good views up and down the beach. To the south you can glimpse Peregos Lagoon, a lake right next to the beach and a good destination for another day. The Bluff trail ends at the walk in campsites, cross the road, and pick up the Cedar Hollow trail on the other side. Whoever named it wasn’t up on their botany, as there are no cedars here, just Doug Fir and hemlock. This trail leaves the bluff and switchbacks down into a forested ravine. Our native large-leaved rhododendron is growing under the shade canopy created by the trees. When in bloom, hikers will be treated to trusses of baby pink flowers. Did you know that the bigleaf rhododendron is the Washington State flower? Once at the bottom of the ravine, the trail heads back up through the woods, until it meets the road that goes through the park.Follow the road until you hit the trail marked ‘Campground’. There are three trails that take off from this trail. All of them follow along a forested ridge.  Take either the Woodpecker Haven, or the Hoot In trail, and follow it until you reach the Watertower trail. On this trail find the wooden scaffolding base of an old water tower. Tempting as it may be for the younger set to climb on this, one good look will show you that the timbers are rotting and dangerous, so admire from afar. After checking out the tower, follow the trail downhill until you meet a road. Walk north along the road until you hit a sign for the Pacific Northwest Trail. Follow this wide trail through the woods until you run into the sign for the park boundary. Turn left and began heading downhill. Soon you will see Pondilla Lake, where the trail will take you down and around the southern shore. If you fish, you might want to try your luck here. Once done exploring the lake, head back up the bluff and follow the trail back to the north parking lot. WTA Pro Tip: Extend your hike! There are more trails here to be explored, and at low tide, it may be possible to walk along the beach to Ebey’s Landing, about 2 miles south. Before you try, check the tide tables and watch your timing. The park also abuts the Kettles Trail System, so longer hikes looping through here are possible. Fort Ebey State Park is open from 8:00 AM to dusk year around. The campground is closed November 1-April 1.  A map can be downloaded from the Washington State Park website: www.parks.wa.gov"

The 8-mile round-trip hike to Black Lake offers the chance to view the abundance of color that springs up after a wildfire. Toasted by a 2003 wildfire that left only a few fir islands in its wake, this corner of the Pasayten Wilderness is recovering nicely, with pioneering penstemon, paintbrush, fireweed and clematis clambering among the avalanche-deposited boulders littering the Lake Creek drainage.The star of the show, though, is spicy-scented snowbrush, the waxy-leaved shrub that produces puffballs of white flowers in late spring. Both fire-dependent and fireprovoking, its terpene-filled leaves are the perfect fuel for the periodic low-intensity fires that are necessary to keep this forest healthy. The trail begins in a grove of trees near Lake Creek and rarely leaves its side. Climb steadily up a snowbrush-covered hillside and enter the Pasayten Wilderness. Pine and fir trees are replaced by steep talus slopes. Thick tangles of blueberry and quaking aspen crowd the trail. There is precious little shade along the way, yet miraculously, several copses of evergreens escaped the fire, offering a break from the sun.At 2.2 miles, cross a small side creek, the only one of many on the trail that necessitates getting your feet wet; at 4 miles cross another trickle of a creek and reach Black Lake. Well-used camping spots cluster on the southeast end of Black Lake, where fire-spared trees provide much-needed shade. Curl up under one for a nap or to thumb through your wildflower field guide (Plants of Southern Interior British Columbia and the Inland Northwest is the best choice for hikes east of the Cascade crest).WTA Pro Tip: Wildflowers are commonly encountered along the trail. Keep a look out for bunchberry, Columbia lily, fireweed, red paintbrush, shrubby and Chelan penstemon, and western blue clematis."

Elk are abundant in this verdant valley, while hikers remain scarce.Irely Lake: Begin under a lofty canopy, compliments of a support team of colossal cedars and spruce. After a small climb of 100 feet come to a flat that's bisected by Irely Creek. Turn south, following the skunk-cabbage-laced creek. Be careful on the rotten puncheon (planking that has deteriorated due to constant saturation). Beavers are active along this stretch, their handiwork causing occasional inundation of the trail.Cross the small creek on a log bridge; then head for higher and drier ground. At 1 mile reach a side trail that leads 0.1 mile down to a grassy spot on Irely Lake. The lake, more a big marsh, is a good place to sit still (if mosquitoes aren't present) and scope out birds. Ducks, woodpeckers, blackbirds, and songbirds are present in large numbers.Big Creek: Beyond Irely Lake the trail traverses muddy lowlands, crossing several creeks that often flood during periods of high rain (which is often). The tread gets rougher and rockier, heading deeper into the saturated, verdant forest. If you could overdose on chlorophyll exposure, it would happen here.Cross a maple flat frequented by elk before beginning a steep climb high above Big Creek. The cedars are enormous along these steep slopes. Several behemoths lay toppled across the trail, victims of strong winter storms.

Strong gusts ensure openings in the canopy, allowing new growth to compete with the entrenched elders.At about 2.5 miles traverse a massive mudslide from the winter of 2006.

Retrace part of the Press Expedition's 1889-90 route across the Olympics, and visit the former site of a lodge that provided warmth and hospitality to trekkers during the 1920s and '30s. Along the North Fork Quinault River, you can embrace the pure wildness and raw beauty of the Olympic rain forest.Like many trails following rivers deep into the Olympic interior, the first couple miles of the North Fork Quinault River Trail were once a road. Building roads up these narrow, wet valleys was difficult enough, but maintaining them proved to be even more challenging. Winter storms and spring floods have a way of wreaking havoc on them. Over the decades and faced with limited budgets, the Park Service allowed some of these disaster-prone roadbeds to be converted to trail-a plus for wilderness and solitude seekers, but a minus for hikers seeking easier access into the backcountry. The decision to convert, not always met with approval, occasionally induces rifts within the hiking community.The North Fork Quinault's first 2.6 miles were converted long ago, making for an easy and enjoyable hike to a wide riverbank camping and picnicking spot known as Wolf Bar. Much of the way is right along the roaring river. And as in the past, the river continues to jump its bank, forcing reroutes and new tread to be built.About 1 mile from the trailhead the first of several side creeks is crossed. While easy during summer, winter rains can make this and the other crossings difficult. At 1.5 miles traverse a huge gravel outwash area arranged with boughs of sword ferns and columns of maples swathed in moss. Next, cross a channel bed that may or may not be flowing. Traverse an alluvial island; then negotiate the channel once more. Now travel over more outwash, through groves of towering old growth and along newly exposed riverbanks.At 2.6 miles arrive at Wolf Bar, a suitable destination for a shorter hike. Head out on the broad gravel bar for views of the surrounding steep-sided ridges adorned in swirling clouds. When the rain is in remission, worship the sun from this extensive outwash.Beyond Wolf Bar the trail climbs a terrace, pulling away from the river. On an up-and-down course through thick forest, but always within earshot of the North Fork, the trail winds up the deep valley. At 5 miles, come to Wild Rose Creek, requiring a ford that may be dangerous during high water. The Halfway House site lies just beyond. Now a backcountry campsite, nothing remains of the old lodge.

Start by following the trail to Rachel Lake, a 3.5 mile trail that gets increasingly steep and rugged as you get closer to the lake. There are some waterfalls along the way to distract you from the trail, but the ratio of scenery to effort is low on this early section of the trail -- you'll be sweating hard by the time you reach Rachel Lake.  When you arrive at the lake, look for a trail on your right marked “Trail”, near the trail to the privy (marked “Toilet”). This trail heads north initially, and then turns west as it travels around the north side of the lake. But before you set out, take a break for a few minutes to enjoy Rachel Lake. The lake is a worthy destination in its own right, with plenty of space to spread out and camp, swim, or just relax.  When you’re ready to continue climbing, head back to the trail signed “Trail”.

Enjoy a few more views of Rachel Lake, and after 0.3 miles, arrive at a junction marked by a cairn. The trail to the left is a climber’s path up Alta Mountain. Steep, rough, and non-technical, it should not be attempted by those with a fear of heights. Continue straight ahead for Lila Lake. Pass through a short area of talus on a good trail, and then arrive at a small tarn. Skirt around the right side of the tarn, and look for a trail to your right. It may not be obvious. If you arrive at a rocky overlook of Lila Lake and its long, narrow island, you have passed that trail. Turn around, and find the trail down to the lake. The trail down to the lake is steep and a little muddy. Bring hiking poles for the descent.At the lake, you will find several campsites, each offering a reasonable amount of privacy and distance from your neighbors. There are also some nice rocks to sit on, and towards the end of summer there are more berries than you can possibly eat.

Down low, the trees that provide you with welcome shade on your way up to the ridge crest are BIG! Though this area was left out of the 1984 Washington Wilderness Act, the trees surrounding you were spared the saw when President Bush signed Wild Sky Wilderness into law in 2008. So on your way up (and up, and up -- you'll gain 2,250 feet in 3.8 miles), stop to admire the ancient beauties that will now last as long as nature allows. Around two miles, the forest canopy begins to thin and huckleberry and mountain ash become more abundant. Now climbing through heather meadows, views to surrounding peaks begin and continue to grow.

Looking Glass can't truthfully be called a lake-it's far too small for that-but when the winds are calm and the air is clear, the tiny tarn does reflect the face of Adams as well as any looking glass.

And judging by how fast camping permits are snatched up for this area, it’s no secret.This trail can be engaged from a variety of starting points depending on time and interest. One popular starting point is the Wonderland Trail at Box Canyon, 10 miles west of the Stevens Canyon Entrance. The first mile is a moderate trek northeast to the Nickel Creek wilderness camp, followed by a vigorous 2,000-foot climb to the crest of the Cowlitz Divide. The trail undulates along the divide, meadows widening the higher you go, and eventually gains another 500 feet to views of Double and Shriner Peaks to the east and The Mountain rising immediately to the west. The trail then drops a quick 800 feet into the valley of the Ohanapecosh River and the wide meadows of Indian Bar. In early summer, numerous waterfalls stream down the walls of the valley, fed by the glaciers above. This makes a good halfway point before starting the next climb.From Indian Bar, the trail continues north, steeply climbing over 1,500 feet in the next 1.5 miles. It then levels somewhat while traversing the meadows of Ohanapecosh Park to the high point on the Wonderland: Panhandle Gap at 6,800 feet. Here you’ll find yourself in the alpine zone, a landscape dominated by rocky talus that often holds snow through the summer months. Rangers and guidebooks issue warnings about traversing the snowfields here in bad weather, so exercise caution and good judgement. This is a common location to spot mountain goats, and the Cowlitz Chimneys can be viewed to the east. From the gap, the trail descends 1.5 miles to the Summerland wilderness camp along Fryingpan Creek. Little Tahoma rises sharply above wide meadows brimming with wildflowers, and Goat Island Mountain dominates to the north. The route then descends steadily along Fryingpan Creek 4 miles to the trailhead at Sunrise Road.Extend Your Hike:  Consider camping at one or more of the four campsites in the area: Nickel Creek (four sites), Olallie Creek, Indian Bar (five sites, one group site), and Summerland (six sites). It can be tough to get permits at these campsites due to the area’s popularity and the fact that you’ll be competing with weekend hikers as well as advance-planning Wonderland Trail hikers for the handful of wilderness campsites available through this section. To improve your chances of scoring a permit and savoring this idyllic location, consider a midweek trip."

Despite heavy logging, road building, and the old Chicago/Milwaukee railroad grade, which was decommissioned in the sixties, this trail maintains a lush character with numerous old-growth trees. The first few miles crosses power lines, the Iron Horse Trail, and Forest Service road 9020. Stick with it and power up the at-times steep trail. Peek-a-boo views of the Alice Valley and Mount Kent to the east will keep you interested. At roughly 2.5 miles into the hike one needs to exercise caution around a series of avalanche chutes and snow bridges which can be undermined by flowing water. These snow runnels can be quite dangerous and hard-packed with snow. At this elevation, snow frequently lasts until early July so be cautious and realistic with your abilities and equipment. If there is snow, come back when it is gone, since on these steep slopes, snow can slide at any time. The trail continues to about 4 miles, where it turns west and then quickly north towards the summit ridge.This last mile of the hike has small meadows, a vernal pond, and scrambly little rocky sections of trail. Although most will be satisfied with the views from this area, the true summit may beckon to others. Those who venture up should keep in mind: rain can make the rock slippery and although technically easy the scramble to the summit is very exposed. Watch for the steps and hand holds blasted into the ridgeline. Views from the top encompass the full range of I-90 peaks, Snoqualmie Pass, and much of the Alpine Lake Wilderness. As you carefully descend the rocky summit, think of the pioneers who first documented these lands. General George B McClellan visited this area in 1853 surveying (unsuccessfully) for a route for rail lines to pass through the Cascades. He chose the never-used Yakima Pass. The more popular route was Snoqualmie Pass, home now to the major interstate highway you used to get to the trailhead."

A short bridge designed to be removed when the creek runs high begins the route. After climbing quickly through a switchback and series of climbing turns the trail winds more gently to Ridell Lake (which is better described as a wetland on its way to becoming a meadow).Curving around the wetland hikers get a nice view of the Rock before heading into the trees again for another climb to Hwy 14 where the route ends opposite the park headquarters. To reach the start of the Beacon Rock Trail, turn left to head east for 100 yards.The main purpose for the trail is to provide a safe passage for visitors who arrive by boat and wish to hike the Rock. But It is also a great way to extend a visit to the park by combining a picnic at Doetsch Ranch picnic area with a hike up to the Rock and back.If you forgot to bring a lunch, the Beacon Rock Cafe nestled in the Skamania General Store has excellent burgers, breakfasts and is a surprising find for those who don't expect much from a roadside general store.

It’s on the “sunny side”, so you won’t have to worry about rain, but it might get a little blustery. Be sure to have your coat with you!The Gingko Petrified Forest Interpretive Trails offer a trip through time, back to when lava flowing across Washington encased the trees. Gradually, the minerals in the lava replaced the organic matter of the trees. What remains are fascinating specimens of mineralized gingkos, spruce, elm, walnut, and fir trees – a remarkably diverse representation of Washington’s state gemstone. A quarter-mile long paved loop trail makes most of the tree specimens accessible for all visitors. Those wishing to explore further can go off the paved path, onto a longer, gravel-and-dirt loop that edges the state park’s property line. Along with the venerable tree specimens, huge sagebrush dot the landscape, some towering over your head as you wend in and out of the petrified trees. Taking a full tour of the area is about a 3-mile jaunt -- just enough time for many visitors to get a good stretch in. One thing of note: because of previous visitors removing pieces of the ancient trees as keepsakes, the remaining trees have been protected by the state park. Please don’t attempt to touch these specimens, or remove any you may find in your wanderings. As tempting as it may be to take a little piece of nature home, the Interpretive Trails must have intact examples for future generations to appreciate these natural marvels."

Whatever the season, this is a beautiful, short walk for those looking for something easy and quick. Beginning from the large parking area just west of Leavenworth, head for a large iron bridge. This originally guided a pipeline across the river crashing below; now it guides hikers to the other side of the whitewater. Be wary though – often the bridge collects water after periods of heavy rain. Once across, it’s a languid stroll upriver. Cottonwoods and pines line your route, and small critters and birds flit about, keeping you company. Seeing the river from this side offers a new perspective. You’ll be up close and personal with the sheer cliffs that are visible from the highway, and right along the riverside.  If it’s a hot summer day, you may be tempted to jump in and cool off, but think twice! Derived from Chinook jargon meaning strong water, the river is truly mighty. Would-be swimmers beware – the current can sweep even the strongest downstream. Luckily, about a half mile in, you’ll encounter a seasonal creek. This can be a trickle in late summer, or a refreshing creek as the snow melts in spring. Better to cool off here, than in the nearby river it feeds. Continuing on, the trail meanders along the Tumwater for 0.7 more miles, before dead-ending at a cliff face. Across the way, take a peek at Castle Rock, a locale favored by climbers.

It's rather dark, and is the only part of your hike that will feel like real forest. Beyond the forest, the route returns to more open country and soon passes a Little League playfield.Beyond the playfield, cross Lake Hills Blvd at the crosswalk (there is no stop light, and traffic moves quickly.)

Pause and enjoy it for a while. Then return to the main trail and continue west another 0.1 mile where the ongoing trail bends around toward the south. Continue on south to the obvious parking area next to two buildings.One building is the Larsen Lake Blueberry Farm produce stand. The other is a genuine pioneer home, originally built near Phantom Lake by Henry Thode, and relocated here and restored to ensure its preservation. Note the carefully hewn joints of the main timbers. Sign boards here offer interesting commentary about the early days of settlement, beginning in the 1880s when this part of Bellevue was mostly a wilderness.The south side of the Thode home now sports public restrooms that are open seasonally from May through September. The adjoining parking area is available for those who prefer to begin their hike at this corner of the park, or who just want to hike around Larsen Lake.Your ongoing trail heads back east, skirting additional blueberry fields, and it rejoins your incoming route at the junction noted above. Turn right at the junction and return to the main parking lot to complete your hike.EXTENDING YOUR HIKEFrom the parking lot, Lake Hills Greenbelt extends another half-mile to the southeast, and that section of the park offers one of the best publically accessible views of Phantom Lake. The round trip adds about 0.6 miles to your hike, and if your time and energy permit you really shouldn't miss it. At the intersection of SE 16th St and 156th Ave SE, cross both streets on the crosswalks and head south on the wide asphalt path that parallels 156th Ave SE. In about a quarter mile, take the side trail downhill to the left. Along the way, an interesting sign board tells how the lake levels have changed over time, in part due to excavations done in the 1890s by Henry Thode, whose relocated home you hiked past earlier.As you approach the lake, the trail forks. The right fork leads to a picnic table that offers only a minimal view across the lake, obscured by offshore cattails. But the left fork leads to a viewing platform that stretches out into Phantom Lake and offers a panoramic view around the lake. Stay a while and take it all in. Then head back toward 156th Ave SE, where you will find a restroom, some picnic tables and a small 10-car parking area. From there, return back north the way you came to reach the main parking lot."

Completing the loop requires a knee-crunching, 1,900-foot descent in the last 2.5 miles back to White River.Extend Your Hike: Sure, this hike can be done in a day, but with so much to see, why not slow it down with a camping trip? Three campsites are available along the route: the Glacier Basin wilderness camp (six sites and one group site), Berkeley Park wilderness camp (three sites), and Sunrise wilderness camp (ten sites and two group sites). Take a few days to soak it all in."

The interpretive loop trail has a gentle grade and scenic views of Icicle Creek, Icicle Gorge, and the surrounding forest that are ideal for families, trail runners, beginner hikers, bird enthusiasts, and those looking to take a nice long walk on a well-defined path.   Start your hike from the parking lot, following the main trail to an information kiosk. Pick up a map of the trails and pause a moment to get your bearings. Read about the wildlife, conservation initiatives, and distinctive habitats in the surrounding area on signs pinned to the kiosk.Continuing on the trail, come to a sign marked Icicle Gorge View River Loop. Turn left to start the four mile loop in a clockwise direction or turn right to do the loop in a counterclockwise direction. There is varied ecology to savor throughout the trail and you will encounter scenic views of the Icicle Creek Valley in either direction, but this description will take you on a clockwise loop. Turning left, walk on the wide, well-traveled trail through the forest and come upon your first glimpse of Icicle Creek after about a quarter of a mile. A small bench on the left encourages a welcome rest, followed by the first of six interpretive signs you’ll encounter along the trail. Pause for a moment here to read about the aging lodgepole pine trees above you and the animal habitats they nurture.  Continuing along the trail, look to your right at Icicle Creek and enjoy the varying shades of green and aqua colors shimmering below the surface.  Arrive at the Icicle Creek Bridge and spot another interpretive sign about the animals and plants that make the unique habitat here their home. As you cross the bridge, take a moment to enjoy the views of Icicle Gorge and the rushing, turbulent waters of Icicle Creek below you. Reaching the other side, you are now on the south side of Icicle Creek. The trail briefly continues along the creek before winding through a more heavily forested area. Pause at an overlook perched above the Creek, almost a mile into your hike, and continue through the forest to a cedar swamp.  Read about the cedar swamp on an interpretive sign as well as plants such as devil’s club: a shrub with large, maple-like leaves and small spines that are prickly to the touch.  Keep your eyes peeled for scampering chipmunks and squirrels and listen for the tap-tap sound of pileated woodpeckers that call this area home.After crossing a couple small wooden bridges, spot the small blue berries of Oregon grape lining the trail. Continue over bridges for Trout Creek and Jack Creek, and pause at two interpretive signs near Jack Creek to read about how plants, insects and fish thrive underwater and how birds, beetles and fungi are helping a nearby tree decompose. Enjoy the peek-a-boo views of Icicle Creek beginning to re-emerge about two and a half miles into your hike, and cross a wide wooden bridge to reach a junction with Road 615.  Bear right to stay on the Icicle Gorge Trail. As you continue on, look down at the views of Icicle Creek below you, being mindful of the steep drop-offs on the righthand side of the trail.  Continue on through a lovely section of tall conifers with views of nearby peaks in the Alpine Lakes Wilderness. Pass campsites for Rock Island Campground on your right, and emerge onto Forest Road 7600. Keep to the right on the road and cross the Rock Island Bridge, returning to the north side of Icicle Creek. Continue to a sign marked Icicle Gorge Trail River Loop, turning right to rejoin the Icicle Gorge Trail. There are picnic benches available here as well as a water fountain and vault toilets.Enjoy plentiful views of Icicle Creek as you continue through this area. At a fork in the trail, head left to check out an interpretive sign on a plant called pine broomrape, or head right to walk a rockier trail closer to Icicle Creek. Either one will work: the trails rejoin in a short distance.  Cross a wooden bridge over Boggy Creek, and about 3.4 miles into your hike, notice a trail on your left that leads towards Forest Road 7600. This is an access point for the Icicle Gorge View Trail, a steeper, less traveled loop trail that climbs to higher-up views of the Icicle Creek Valley as well as Bootjack Mountain and Icicle Ridge.To complete the Icicle Gorge Trail loop, continue straight on the trail past this junction. Pass by a couple exposed areas with benches that overlook Icicle Creek: good choices for a picnic lunch or a snack break. The parking lot will soon come into view on your left; bear right on the trail to finish the loop.  Extending your Hike: Head up the steeper Icicle Gorge View Trail (called simply “View Trail” on the map provided at the kiosk) to add roughly an extra 1.25 miles to your hike. At one point the View Trail splits and parts of the trail are overgrown with brush; be sure to read the entry for the Icicle Gorge View Trail on this site for the best route to take."

And, like Townsend, there are several ways to access them. MAIN MOUNT TOWNSEND TRAILThe most loved of the routes up Townsend starts at what is commonly referred to as the ‘Upper Trailhead’. The ‘Lower Trailhead’ on this route starts 1.2 miles and 400 feet elevation farther down the valley. It can be a good access option when snow has closed higher elevation roads. The trail starts out accompanied by the crashing of Townsend Creek and soon switchbacks through old-growth with a thick understory of rhododendrons.The track makes a long westward-rising traverse through fir and hemlock, interrupted by three ravines. These ravines get progressively more open both up and down their drainages, providing peek-a-boo views across the valley. Shortly after the trail breaks into a broad, sloped meadow, stop and listen. You may be able to pick out first the sounds and then sights of a couple small waterfalls. The more obvious one drains off of Townsend and the other off of the Welch Peaks to the southwest.Switchbacks resume in this open area and take one from meadow to forest and back to meadow. The open views to the east offer better and better views across to the Cascades. Shortly before Camp Windy the trail crests an open rock face that brings most hikers to a brief halt to enjoy the views and the moment. At 2.6 miles down the trail, overnighters can enjoy Camp Windy as a nice rest stop. The water source, shallow Windy Lake, is a great reflecting pool for the surrounding trees and cliffs.The switchbacks above Camp Windy bring you to the intersection with the Silver Lake Trail at 3.0 miles. Head over a narrow pass and down 2.5 miles to Silver Lakes.DIRTY FACE RIDGE TRAILIf, after making the brutal trek to the top of Townsend using the Dirty Face Ridge Trail you want to continue to another destination, toddle on down to Silver Lakes. From the summit of Townsend, head south down the main Townsend trail toward Quilcene. Not sure which one that is? Just look for the one that the most people have come upDescend about a half mile, down several switchbacks on the south flanks of the mountain before reaching a junction signed for Silver Lake. The sign is on a tree that you may miss coming from this direction, so keep a sharp eye out to your right as you descend. The way to Silver Peak shoots off at the bend of a switchback, so instead of continuing downhill, go straight onto the trail toward Silver Lakes. From here, it's 2.5 miles downhill to Silver Lake. Don't forget, you've got to come all the way back up and out of here, too!A round-trip from the Dirty Face Ridge trailhead is about 14 miles. LITTLE RIVER TRAILThe Little Quilcene Trail offers a similar workout to the Dirty Face Ridge Trail. From the Little Quilcene Trailhead to the peak of Mount Townsend is 3.4 miles and 2180 feet in elevation gain, enough to prompt more than a few breaks to catch your breath. After two miles, the trail intersects with the Tubal Cain Trail. At this junction, the trail moves up the north side of Mount Townsend and opens up to views to the west looking into the Dungeness and Graywolf watersheds. Head to the summit and Silver Lakes following the directions in the Dirty Face Ridge Trail. WTA Pro Tip: No matter how you access it, consider making this trek an overnight. There is plenty of camping at the lake, and water sources along the way. Regardless of your access point, your hike will be in the double digits round trip."

You’ll likely have company at the summit, but this route offers solitude to get there, along with some sweeping views, plus steeps to work those quads! Consider why it's so infrequently used -- a sign at the trailhead warns of grades up to 40% in places! It's short, but there's nothing sweet about it. Park at the Tubal Cain trailhead and walk up the road to a trail signed “Little Quilcene Trail #835” on the left. Not one to lull you into a false sense of ease, the trail starts off climbing steeply and stays that way for two miles. It's a burner, to be sure. Just before the junction with the Mount Townsend trail, break out onto a ridge and take in your first of many expansive views.Catch your breath and look for the Tubal Cain trail across the valley before dipping back into forest before arriving at a signed junction 2.3 miles in. Here, leave the Little Quilcene Trail, proceeding straight on the trail signed for Mount Townsend. You'll hike through subalpine forest and wide open talus slopes dotted with shrubs as you progress 2.4 miles to the summit of Townsend. Your progress is still upward, but at a much more merciful grade than the previous two miles. Just past the wilderness boundary is a fork in the trail. Either one gets you to the summit, but the right-hand trail is a more direct route. If you take the left fork, you’ll reach the second summit first, then continue to the first, generally more peopled summit. Either high point is an ideal spot to dump your pack and enjoy a leisurely lunch while taking in the panoramic views of Olympics, Hood Canal, Cascades, Strait of Juan de Fuca, Port Townsend, Seattle, and more. WTA Pro Tip: This is just one of several ways to reach the summit of this popular mountain. The more popular main Townsend trail is more forgiving, but the Little River Trail (which you passed on the way up) is just about as much of a burner as this one. Check out a map for some nice loop options using all these access points."

However, to get to the Stehekin road is a day or more trip, so you'll need to plan more than one day for this trip. From its trailhead on the Upper Stehekin Valley Road, the Flat Creek Trail almost crosses a bridge over the mighty Stehekin River. The birdwatching from here is good, so if you brought your binoculars, look for dippers! Once past the bridge, a sign points the way to Flat Creek Camp, re-built in 2009 and which now features two large, forested sites within earshot of the Stehekin River. Luckily though, you won't be within earshot of each other, so the camping is relaxing and quiet. In 2001, the Flat Creek Fire raged through here, burning the first two miles of the trail. Now, fireweed gives the blackened trees a pop of beautiful color, and woodpeckers can be heard tapping high in the branches above. The trail ascends through the valley, offering occasional glimpses of Peak 6062, a mighty fin of tree-covered rock punching into the air above the verdant valley. After the first 2 miles, views of the valley below recede into the brushy trail, and you leave North Cascades National Park. Soon, pass through some enormous old-growth western redcedar trees, and at 3.3 miles, the trail joins the West Fork Flat Creek. The trail continues on the other side of the creek, but no bridge spans this section. If the water is too high, enjoy the views from the this side of the creek -- it can be quite dangerous to cross when the water is strong. Past the creek crossing, the trail becomes brushier and harder to navigate. It continues another mile into the forest, with limited views, before ending in another stand of western redcedar.WTA Pro Tip: The best section of this trail is the first 3.3 miles, before the water crossing. While the true length of this trail is 4.2 miles, better to shorten it and enjoy a peaceful day hike with a round trip of 6.6 miles."

But strong river activity due to snowmelt and rain events washed the road out frequently, and for one final time in 2003. Now it's accessible by foot only, and many of the trails found along this route are some of your best chance for solitude in the state.Car Wash Falls, was a waterfall that went right over the old road, provided a nice rinse for cars when it was running low, but a crushing tumult of water when levels were high. In 2003, these falls pounded down on the road so hard it blasted a section of it out into the river, and the park service elected to leave the road washed out, moving all hikers onto a trail bypass on the Pacific Crest Trail towards Bridge Creek.Hikers have always been able to bypass this road section, even when it was an option to drive into the upper valley. Now, this section is a must-do in order to access most trails in the upper valley. Beginning from High Bridge, hike along the road on a somewhat steep grade for a mile past Tumwater Camp. After another mile, cross the Stehekin River on a large bridge and hop onto the PCT northbound for Bridge Creek. The trail rolls moderately through beautiful forest and one remarkable section of old burn vibrant with magenta fireweed almost five feet tall. Soon though, it plunges back into dark forest, becoming slightly more rooty and rugged for another 3 miles until you arrive at Bridge Creek Camp.This campground is open to horses, hikers, and groups, and a backcountry camping permit is required to stay overnight here. Please make arrangements through North Cascades National Park complex. The Pacific Crest Trail now rejoins the old roadbed for a time, and you’ll have the chance to walk side-by-side with your hiking partner--if you have one--as you make your way down the old road, which has been remarkably well preserved in the years since the washout.Just up the road from Bridge Creek, a trail splits off – this is the Pacific Crest Trail as it continues north to Rainy Pass and eventually the trail’s endpoint in Manning Park, Canada. Making a left turn, follow the road and shortly arrive at the Goode Ridge trailhead. This trail to a former lookout tower is a burner, shooting up 4400 feet in just 5 miles, but the panorama from the summit is stunning. Continue another three miles down the old road, enjoying periodic glimpses of the river. A trailhead 2.7 miles from the Goode Ridge trail is for Park Creek Pass, an epic jaunt along Park Creek and up into a wide, fairytale pass. This is another way to exit the valley – follow the Park Creek Pass trail long enough and you’ll wind up on Highway 20!A few hundred yards up the road from Park Creek Pass is Flat Creek Camp and its accompanying trail. The campground here is quite large, but can only accommodates two large groups – again, be sure to make arrangements with the National Park Service if you plan on staying here overnight. From Flat Creek, it’s 3.7 miles more road walking before arriving at the end of the road. Cottonwood Camp is a large camp area that may be set up for the Stehekin Valley Tent-to-Tent trips. Check stehekinoutfitters.com for more information about these trips. From here, the road becomes an honest to goodness trail, which provides access to a handful of other campgrounds, Cascade Pass and Sahale Arm, Horseshoe Basin, and eventually, Highway 20.WTA Pro Tip: Many trails along the Stehekin River Road can also be accessed from Highway 20. Consider making your visit to Stehekin a one-way trip – arrive via ferry and make arrangements to hike out and get picked up on the other side. Even better, consider starting from a Highway 20 trailhead and hiking into Stehekin – the Stehekin Pastry Company is a hiker mecca, particularly for those of you putting in lots of miles."

Edds Mountain is on the edge of the 1988 White Mountain fire, so this trail winds through both an open forest of large and lovely old-growth larches with their bright green crowns to silvery snags. Grasses wave in the breeze and colorful wildflowers dot the open hillsides. From the trailhead, you'll start your hike on a decommissioned forest road. Just before a mile and a half, the trail gets down to business climbing steeply up Edds Mountain. As you near the summit, the grade becomes a little more forgiving, just in time for you to take in the wide views around you. Before reaching the summit, you'll swing around the south side of Edds Mountain and then continue rambling east on the ridge towards Bald Mountain. Skirt south of Bald Mountain until you run into the south section of the Kettle Crest Trail (http://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/kettle-crest-south) at 5.6 miles.If the trail disappears on you, keep your eyes peeled for rock cairns that have been built on more open sections of the trail to mark the way. Looking to overnight or extend your trip? The Kettle Crest Trail is the key. Grab a map and plot out your options. In the early season, springs should provide water along the way, but when things heat up, you may have to search below the ridge for most of the water. While a few WTA crews have pulled the handle of a saw on this trail in the past, the trail receives most lot of much-needed maintenance from the Backcountry Horsemen of Washington.

Offer the exhilaration of climbing it certainly does, proceeding well above the treeline to a summit that hardly looks attainable from a distance; but it also offers an intimate view of the very heart of the North Cascades, the kind of immersive experience not available by gazing up from the valleys below. From wildflower meadows in its early stretches to stark granite at the top, it is a front row seat for all that draws us upward.The contrast between the start of the trail and the end could not be greater. The path to the Hidden Lake Lookout starts out in dense forest along and occasionally through and over runoff streams. After about a mile, the trail emerges into the open below soaring cliffs and ridges in a deep creek drainage. Shortly after, it crosses the east fork of Sibley Creek for the first of two times and begins switchbacking over badly eroded tread through fields of false hellebore, slide alder, and–unfortunately–stinging nettles. Soon, though, the unruly undergrowth fades to meadows of wildflowers, in early summer it delivers a stunning display in both color and variety. Roughly a mile from the prior creek crossing, the trail makes it second hop over Sibley Creek. Here the terrain undergoes yet another radical transformation. For the next three quarters of a mile, you make your mostly level way across a rocky slope filled with heather and blueberries. In fall, this may be the very best place in the Cascades to find highly prized vaccinium deliciosum, the most flavorful of all mountain blueberries. Meanwhile, the giants of the North Cascades come into view. The sheer western face of Eldorado Peak’s perfect pyramid peers over the headwaters of Sibley Creek. In the other direction, Mount Baker and Mount Shuksan hover above the ridge of Big Devil Peak. At the end of this stretch, the trail swings to the south. Snow lingers late, and even at the end of summer, the gully the trail climbs through may well hold patches of snow. The surroundings change dramatically yet again, with the trees and subalpine meadows giving way to bare granite. In a quarter of a mile, you see the lookout for the first time. It looks menacingly unattainable, perched next to broken rock that seems to reach for the sky in a giant claw at the top of a near-vertical face. To the south, the smooth glaciers of Snowking Mountain make a brief appearance. In another quarter of a mile, you reach a high saddle that marks the boundary of North Cascades National Park. If the view here doesn’t take your breath away, check for a pulse: the dark waters of Hidden Lake seem to disappear over the lip of a hanging valley beyond which stand some of the staunchest sentinels of the North Cascades – Johannesburg Peak, Sahale Mountain, Boston Peak, and Mount Forbidden. From here, the trail is much more informal. It traverses to the right over a steep open slope beneath the summit, intersecting the visible ridgeline about halfway up its length. There the route heads right over jumbled boulders. You may be able to pick out a smoother bootpack in the dirt and follow it until reaching the summit lookout. As you would expect from someplace once used for spotting wildfires, 360-degree views of an immense area now open up around you.  What makes the view so remarkable is the extent to which the long ridge containing the most storied mountaineering prizes of the North Cascades is laid out like a ribbon in front of your eyes. Seldom are hikers surrounded by so many mighty mountains in one spot: Sahale, Triad, Eldorado, Torment, Boston, Forbidden, Klawatti, Sharkfin. From here, you can see just how closely one stacks on top of the next after the next. Not to be overlooked is the lookout itself, a living museum and relic of the network of such structures that once numbered in the hundreds, strung out across the state. There are many mountaintops where the only traces of the lookouts that once stood upon them are some rusty nails, burnt timbers, and broken glass. Ascend to the summit of Crater Peak or Mount Pugh, and that is all you’ll find there; but here, the lookout endures, despite having been retired from service many decades ago. It speaks both to the durability of its construction and the commitment of the individuals who have given so much to preserve it. Built in 1932, the Hidden Lake Lookout was decommissioned by the Forest Service sometime around 1953. In 1960, the Skagit Alpine Club secured a special use permit to renovate and maintain it for club activities, but by 1980, the club had turned its attention to the Park Butte Lookout instead. One of SAC’s members, however, wasn’t ready to let Hidden Lake Lookout go. Dr. Fred Darvill formed a group called the Friends of Hidden Lake Lookout under the auspices of the Skagit Environmental Council and took over responsibility for its maintenance. Many people think of the lookout as a camping shelter, and it is in fact available on a first-come, first-serve basis; but Dr. Darvill intended its preservation mostly for historical purposes. Darvill, who passed away in late 2007, is a somewhat under-recognized figure in the history of the outdoors in Washington. He was an authority in backcountry first aid and was an effective advocate for wilderness, playing an instrumental role in the creation of the North Cascades National Park. It’s altogether fitting that this spot, looking out over the park, has become such a visible legacy of his work.As he became less able to visit the lookout, his role as chief steward passed to Robert Kendall. On a jaunt up here, you may very well run into Robert on one of his work parties at the lookout. If you see him, be sure to say thanks for the work he does (or offer to help!), and if you stay in the lookout, be sure to donate what you can to help cover supplies (there’s a rough guideline of $15-$25/night). Ironically, the lookout has now stood as a historic monument longer than it served its original function as a fire lookout. In 1987, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. This place–the intersection of so much incredible terrain and history–is one of the most remarkable hiking destinations in all of the Cascades; and while it may not be quite as immediately scenic as spots like the Enchantments or Sahale Arm, it holds a special allure that is very hard to overstate.  WTA Pro Tip: While no special permit is required to stay in the lookout (which sits just outside the park boundary), camping at Hidden Lake (or anywhere between the lake and the ridge line) requires a backcountry permit available at the ranger station in Marblemount. There is no trail from the saddle to the lake, so be prepared to clamber over boulders as you find your route. Don’t camp on the shores of the lake or other nearby tarns – the landscape here is quite fragile. Look for bare dirt or established sites. Campfires are not permitted."

This trail is primarily used by hikers heading to the summit of McGregor Mountain, the most prominent peak towering over the Stehekin Valley, but Howard Lake is a nice destination in and of itself, if you don’t have the time or the desire to tackle the 16 mile roundtrip hike up McGregor. Originally named Coon Lake, this little lake has become known as Howard Lake in many circles. The name is after Wilson Howard, who lived nearby and who was one of two black miners to stake mining claims in the North Cascades. The lake is accessed by a section of the Pacific Crest Trail, which continues north past the turnoff for Howard Lake. Originally, this section of trail functioned as an access road for miners in this area from nearby Bridge Creek camp. Howard had mining claims here in the 1890s. While some believe the former name came from raccoons that lived in the area, many believed it was a racial epithet. Since 2009, many have called for the name to be changed to honor Howard and the unique life he had, but as of this 2015 writing, the change is still awaiting final approval by the Washington State Board for Geographic Names. However, most individuals and groups have made the change to Howard Lake. From the High Bridge Guard Station (a remnant from the era of the Civilian Conservation Corps), look for a trail heading north. This is the Pacific Crest Trail. Follow it along the base of a small knoll, heading northeast along wide tread before it makes a turn and begins climbing moderately on more rugged terrain.The landscape goes from open Ponderosa forest to a greener, more lush area in just half a mile. As the trail switchbacks uphill, look for a junction with a trail signed as the Cascade Horse Trail.

Just a few hundred feet down this trail, find Howard Lake.A large rock makes a great spot for picnicking and relaxing. Take in 8000-foot McGregor Mountain towering over you, and listen to wildlife all around you. If you like, retrace your steps and explore further north on the Pacific Crest Trail.

And with wildflowers in spring, blueberry bushes for trail-side snacking in late summer and blazing color in the fall, you can't pick a bad season to visit.Since this is a loop hike accessible from three separate parking lots, there are many options for this adventure, though as is often the case, some choices are better than others. This description addresses two directions of the same loop, which both offer stunning views and plenty of trailside rewards along the way.From the Artist Point parking lot, hike counter-clockwise. This gets the steep, road-adjacent Wild Goose section out of the way by descending it first and then climbing up to Herman Saddle. This direction means you'll hit the high point of the loop on fresh, strong legs, and allows you to enjoy the lakes and milder hiking later in the day.From the Artist Point parking lot, look for the privy. Just to the right of it is an unmarked trail. Follow this down a short ways through the rocks, cross the road leading to overflow parking, and look for a tall, permanent cairn marked ""Wild Goose Trail."" Follow this well-maintained but steep trail down to the Austin Pass/Heather Meadows parking lot. As you descend, pause to admire Bagley Lakes below and look across to see the Chain Lakes trail cutting across the hillside, between Table Mountain (left) and Mount Herman (right) up to Herman Saddle.Once you arrive at Austin Pass, walk down and left across the parking lot. Note that there is another privy here for the well-hydrated. To continue your hike, look for a gap in the low stone wall next to an interpretive sign. Walk through the gap and look for a trail down through the flat rocks--do not follow the paved path to the left as it leads to a dead-end view point overlook. Once through the flat rocks, the trail descends gently to the left toward the larger of the two Bagley Lakes. When you get to the stone bridge, you can head right to do a loop around the smaller, more northerly Bagley Lake. Looping around the lake adds a mile to your hike; to avoid this detour, cross the bridge and go left along the shore of the larger lake and up to Herman Saddle.On the way up, rest and look over your shoulder. 9,131 foot Mount Shuksan dominates the horizon behind you in all her glory. One of the most photographed mountains in the world, Shuksan is a Lummi word (spelled ""šéqsən"") meaning High Peak. Cresting Herman Saddle brings you to the high point of the hike at around 5,400 feet where views extend in every direction. 10,781 foot Mount Baker now dominates the horizon ahead and will remain there for most of the rest of the loop. Rounding out the vista are Table Mountain, Mounts Shuksan and Herman, as well as the rest of the pointy North Cascades lineup while lakes, valleys and meadows spread out below. It's not a bad spot to pause for a snack and congratulate yourself on the good life choices that got you here.Once you're ready to continue, drop down the other side of Herman Saddle, where Iceberg Lake comes into view. Continue through idyllic grassy meadows, heather and blueberry bushes until Hayes Lake appears on the right. When you've almost passed Hayes Lake, the trail forks into three paths. The main trail continues straight and to the left, while a small foot path leads sharply left to a pit toilet overlooking Iceberg Lake. This is marked with a small wooden sign pointing in that direction and marked ""toilet"". If you have swimming or a lakeside rest in mind, follow the trail off to the right along the shore of Hayes Lake with various access points to rocky beaches as well as campsites.Back on the main trail, proceed a short way to Iceberg Lake on the left, with plenty of access to its beaches as well. The trail continues on to the paired Mazama Lakes with a few campsites on the opposite shore. Once past these last two lakes, what was lost in the beginning of the hike must be gained. Climb back out of the lake basin. It's a milder ascent than the one to Herman Saddle, and Mount Baker keeps you company all the while. At the crest, you are again surrounded by views; Mount Shuksan rejoins the party and Mount Baker seems closer than ever.From here, the Ptarmigan Ridge trail heads up to the right, and the Chain Lakes trail veers left to close the loop back to Artist Point. This last 1.2 mile stretch is mostly flat but incredibly scenic, with Mount Shuksan ahead, Mount Baker behind, the Swift Creek and Rainbow valleys below, and even a glimpse of Baker Lake off in the distance. Watch and listen for marmots in the rocks below as you soak up the last of the views.ALTERNATE ROUTEFor those who'd rather climb first than descend the steep Wild Goose section, the loop starts at Austin Pass/Heather Meadows. The Wild Goose trail is well-marked and easy to find from the upper, southwest of the parking lot just off of Hwy 542. Big cairns mark the trail on both sides of the one road crossing at the overflow parking just below Artist Point. Once you arrive at the big Artist Point parking lot, walk straight across it and rejoin the well-signed ""Chain Lakes"" trail below Table Mountain rising to the right. In 0.2 miles, continue on past the junction where the Table Mountain trail heads off to the right.Admire big, showy Mount Baker ahead of you for this mostly flat mile with the Swift Creek and Rainbow valleys stretching out below and Mount Shuksan behind you. Around 5200 feet, there is a rocky outcrop with views of Mounts Baker and Shuksan. Arrive at a junction with the Ptarmigan Ridge trail; your route veers right and descends to the lakes.From here the trail is obvious and easy to follow, leading first to the paired Mazama Lakes, past Iceberg Lake on the right, and on to Hayes Lake ahead. At Hayes, a side trail on the left offers beach access, or you can stick to the main trail, admiring Hayes from above.From Hayes, the trail climbs up to the high point at Herman Saddle. Glance back occasionally for views of Mount Baker with Iceberg Lake below. At Herman Saddle--around 5400 feet--enjoy big views in every direction before beginning the long descent down to Bagley Lakes. The reward of hiking this route is the lake, where you can dip your feet (or as much of yourself as you'd like) in the blissfully cool water. At the stone bridge, add an easy, flat mile to the hike by continuing on around the smaller, northern Bagley Lake, or cross the bridge and make the short ascent back up to the parking lot at Austin Pass. When your legs protest this little climb, give a thought to the folks who parked at Artist Point and chose to go clockwise. Sometimes it's nice to remember that things could be worse.WTA Pro Tip: Carry sandals or water shoes if you'd like to go swimming or just dip your feet into the lakes; the shores are rocky. On the way home, consider stopping at the aptly named Beer Shrine (North Fork Brewery) in Deming where the food and beverages (including root beer on tap) are done right and make for a fitting end to a good day in the mountains."

Start at the large parking lot signed for Bagley Lakes and the Wild Goose trails. Just past the trailhead, take a right turn and head down about 60 feet to Lower Bagley Lake at the foot of Mt. Herman. At the lake, choose the left fork (signed Bagley Lakes Loop), and hike along the trail that runs along the east side of the lake.The way is easy for little feet, and children will delight in the wildflowers along the trail. As you reach the upper end of the lake, the source turns into a burbling creek for the next quarter mile as the views of Table Mountain and the cirque below it open up. At Upper Bagley Lake, cross over the creek on an arching stone bridge and walk along its northwest shore. There are places to dip toes into the freezing water or to simply contemplate the majesty of the area.A good destination for a short outing is the year-round snowfield at the upper part of the lake. To get there requires some sure-footedness around a stone wall. Kids can throw a snowball or two and everyone can admire the braided waterway as it runs down to form the lake. Do make sure that no one plays on top of the snow bridge above the creek; it could break.To return, go back to the stone bridge. To complete the loop, choose the Chain Lakes trail that runs along the opposite side of Lower Bagley Lake. That way is a bit harder than the trail on the way in, crossing some rocks and seasonal streams - but it is still quite easy for most kids over four. This trail will cross the output of the lake on a little dam. Take a left after the dam and return up to the parking lot."

You’ll get a view of the famed Rainbow Falls, traipse through a recovering burn area and have beautiful down-valley views of the head of Lake Chelan and the mouth of the Stehekin River. There are two trailheads for this hike, so it is less of a loop than a horseshoe, unless you access the trailhead using a bike and need to return to your starting point to reclaim your it. If this is your plan, start from the lower trailhead – there is more elevation gain on the hike itself, but more room to stash a bike. Point to point, this is a 4.4 mile hike either way, but adding the return trip makes it more than 8 miles if you’re hiking back from the upper trailhead. However, if you are relying on the shuttle bus, start at the upper trailhead, since it’s a much shorter walk back to the landing if you miss the shuttle at the end of your hike. Simply ask for a dropoff at the upper Rainbow Loop trailhead from the bus driver. To access the lower trailhead, proceed up the Stehekin Road a little less than a mile past the Stehekin Pastry Company (about three miles from the ferry landing). Look for a trailhead sign a few hundred feet back from the road with mileages for the Rainbow Loop and Rainbow Creek trails. You’ve arrived!Hop on the trail and almost immediately begin gaining elevation as you proceed east, paralleling Boulder Creek. The trail turns sharply away from the creek shortly after entering the 2010 Rainbow Bridge burn area. This fire was started by a lightning strike in a camp along the Rainbow Creek Trail and quickly spread to 3,635 acres, closing many of the trails on the east side of the valley and threatening structures on the valley floor. No structures or lives were lost, but several trails in this area, including the Rainbow Loop, now pass through sections of burns. Hike carefully as you pass through here, and watch for wind. If it becomes gusty, consider visiting another time. 1.7 miles from the lower trailhead, the Boulder Creek trail splits off, heading up along Boulder Creek and eventually looping back down to the landing area. That’s a multi-day excursion, however. Your trail continues off to the left.Continue traversing through the burn area, enjoying picture-perfect vistas of the head of the lake before reaching another junction 1.2 miles from the lower trailhead. This is the Rainbow Creek Trail. Another excellent multi-day hike option, Rainbow Creek is accessible from Highway 20 as well as Stehekin. This is also your high point, and from here, the trail descends 2.2 miles and 900 feet to the upper trailhead. Don’t miss the cheerful sign at this end with rainbow-painted letters. Snag a shuttle bus heading back to the landing from here, or turn left and head down the road. A local may offer you a ride to the landing, or if the bus comes by, you can usually flag them down for a ride. Just be sure to have cash with you for the $7 fare. WTA Pro Tip: The best way to hike this as a true loop is if you’re staying at Harlequin Campground. The mileage in this case is 6.6 miles round trip, if you walk to the lower trailhead from the campground and follow the directions offered in the description above to the upper trailhead.In almost any case, the Rainbow Loop is one you can only do if you’re overnighting in Stehekin, there’s just not enough time in the ferry schedule to do it without missing the last boat out."

And now, thanks to efforts from the National Park Service trail crew, a short trail exists here, offering a modest amount of elevation gain for a new vantage point of the waterfall. From the bus turnaround and parking area, walk toward the enormous picnic table and interpretive sign. The falls are visible through the fragrant Ponderosa pines, and two viewing areas bring you close to the splash pool at the base of the falls. But look to your left to find a wide trail switchbacking up the shoulder of the hillside near the falls. Stairsteps have been installed, but still, watch your footing. The mist from the falls keeps this trail damp year-round, and the materials used to build up the trail can become slippery or even icy, depending on what season it is when you visit. The trail is quite short, less than a quarter mile, but a nice landing platform at the top of the switchbacks is a great place to get some photos before heading back to the parking area. WTA Pro Tip: Make the most of your day in Stehekin. Take the Lady Express uplake and rent bikes to ride up to Rainbow Falls. Combine the Mist Trail with an amble around Buckner Orchard and a visit to the old one-room schoolhouse, then cap it all off with a visit to the Stehekin Pastry Company before catching the Lady of the Lady II back downlake. This gives you nearly three hours in the valley, the most amount of time you can spend here if you are relying on the ferry for transport to and from Stehekin."

It’s an easy forested walk along the mighty Stehekin River on a side of the valley that few visitors get to see. Begin from Harlequin Bridge, 5 miles up the Stehekin Road. Cross the bridge and turn right, following the road for a half-mile, looking for a wide gravel road to your left. Turn onto this road, and continue along it to the Stehekin airstrip. The trailhead is at the south end of the airstrip, disappearing almost immediately into dense forest. For about a mile, the trail meanders at the base of the mountains on the west side of the valley, crossing Blackberry Creek and a few other streams that feed the Stehekin River, before the river itself really comes into view. A little more than a mile down the trail you are directly across from the historic Buckner homestead. Look across the wide river at views of the large meadows and views of the mountains on the east side of the valley before turning back to the trail and into the woods. At this point the trail can become more muddy, particularly if it’s springtime. It can also be buggy – bring whatever you use to repel the little pests in order to make your hike more enjoyable. However, if you can make it through this last stretch of trail, you’ll pass various residences visible on the other side of the river, and finally arrive at Weaver Point, a kayak-in campground utilized by anglers, fishermen or other recreationists. There are picnic tables here, and a new perspective of the landing area that many visitors to Stehekin don’t get. If you elect to swim here, keep in mind that the land to your left (as you look to the lake, across the mouth of the river) is private. Please respect the resident’s privacy. WTA Pro Tip: About a half-mile from Weaver Point is a trail that takes off up the slopes of the mountain towering above you. This is the Devore Creek Trail, which climbs up the Devore drainage and connects with the Company Creek trail, which provides access into Holden Village, a Lutheran retreat center. Unlike Stehekin, Holden Village cannot welcome visitors who have not registered to visit – if you plan on making a thru-hike, please check in with them in advance: holdenvillage.org"

The Buckner Cabin, built in 1889, on the National Register of Historic Places since 1974, is the oldest structure in the valley. 100 years after its construction, the Buckner farm was established as an historic district. The district includes 15 buildings whose history represents a six decade span, from 1889 to the 1950s. Also featured are various landscape structures and ruins, and a large, still operational apple orchard irrigated by hand-dug ditches.Today, the Park Service maintains the Buckner homestead and farm as an interpretive center, and it also serves as a community gathering place for residents and guests in the Stehekin valley. To take a walking tour of the area, you will want to pick up a self-guided walk booklet at the beginning of Buckner Lane or near the cluster of historic buildings nestled deep in the orchard. Wandering along Buckner Lane, accessible from the Stehekin Valley Road, is a good way to access this area. Tall cedar trees shade the path, which follows a gravity irrigation ditch that was installed when the orchard was established more than 100 years ago, and still waters the orchard today. Wondering what that concrete block is next to the apples? It’s used by locals for square dances, potlucks, and outdoor concerts in the summertime. Past this structure, take in the more historic buildings of the Buckner Homestead and see the old farm equipment. Views from the orchard include valley walls soaring up on either side; McGregor Mountain dominates the eastern valley wall. A large meadow full of grass just past the historic buildings begs to be waded through, and access to the Stehekin River is possible through a cool forested section. An annual Harvest Fest is held here to celebrate (and, appropriately, harvest) the apples in the autumn. If you’re interested in attending, check out bucknerhomestead.org for details and to learn more about the history of the area. WTA Pro Tip: The Buckner Homestead is just one stop on the tour of historic buildings in the Stehekin Valley. Also be sure to stop at the old schoolhouse just down the road. In fact, if you’re on the bus, get off when it stops at the old one-room schoolhouse and when you’re done there, walk up the road about a quarter mile to Buckner Orchard. Along the way, consider stopping at Rainbow Falls, as well."

It is a great option for beginner hikers looking to up their hiking game as well as those looking for exceptional mountain views without the mileage and time commitment of a longer hike.Starting at the shared trailhead for Blue Lake Trail 604, head into the forest teeming with pacific silver fir, subalpine fir, and mountain hemlock. The trail is straightforward and easy to follow— clear dirt paths alternate with more eroded and rubbled sections.

Mount Baker is the brightest star in a constellation of peaks visible to you on a clear day, including Mount Shuksan, Glacier Peak, Sloan Peak, Whitehorse Mountain, Three Fingers, Mount Rainier, Mount Angeles, Hurricane Hill, Twin Sisters, and Loomis Mountain. The clear, turquoise waters of Baker Lake stretch out to the east, as well as the verdant Skagit Valley to the south. Enjoy your lunch or snack in the company of these fine landmarks, and marvel at how a fire lookout, built in the mid-1930s, once stood in this very spot until the early 1960s.WTA Pro Tip: Even though the trail is relatively short, pack hiking poles, sun protection, and plenty of water. The trail is a bit roughed-up in stretches and poles will help navigate these areas. It is also very exposed the last mile to the summit, so a hat and sunscreen will come in handy as well as plenty of water.Extend Your Hike: Make your hike a two-for-one by checking out Blue Lake on your way back to the trailhead.

Over the course of the trail there are at least six spur trails, many of them signed, taking off in every direction, offering the chance to extend your hike in a myriad of ways. The old logging road bed, which accounts for most of T-3, climbs at a steady grade for three miles, gaining roughly 2000 feet in the progress.

Calvin and Minnie Galley established a farmstead east of Lake Sammamish at the turn of the twentieth century. The property remained with the Galley family until 2000, when it was sold to the City of Sammamish. The city developed the farmstead into a suburban nature preserve, and WTA built the initial trails in 2010 and 2011, leading to an October 2011 opening. Due to continued efforts of WTA volunteers over the ensuing years, the trail system has continued to grow and connects the lower and upper trailheads on 224th Ave NE and Sahalee Way NE, respectively. Take a loolk at a short video tour describing WTA's work at Evans Creek, and the benefits that the preserve provides residents of or visitors to Sammamish: http://media.sammamish.us/EvansCreekPreserve.mp4If you park at the lower trailhead, enter the Preserve on the crushed gravel, ADA-accessible path that crosses Evans Creek over a steel truss pedestrian bridge.

The terrain quickly transitions to hillside foreset as you walk south, but feel free to make random turns, because beauty lies in every direction.As you climb the hill, note the Douglas-fir, western hemlock, red cedar, alder, and maple that form the canopy. Vine maple, low Oregon grape, Indian plum, and salmonberry form the understory, and a rich supply of ferns and mosses testify to this locale’s ample rainfall. Woodpeckers, brown creepers, and squirrels frolic in the trees. Trillium, bleeding heart, fringecup, and miner’s lettuce bloom in the spring.At the top of the ridge, cruise over the WTA’s hand built bridges and turnpikes that keep your boots dry as you wend your way towards the Sahalee trailhead.

One is western white pine, it has long soft gray green needles, and usually found growing more to the west. The other is whitebark pine, it generally grows in dry soil at high elevations and has greener needles that are more waxy.

WTA worked here in summer 2015 to clear overgrown brush on the trail and to help prevent further wear and tear, so offer a silent tip of the hat to the volunteers who gave this trail some much needed TLC.About a quarter mile into your hike you will reach a signed junction where the trail splits. Bear left for Blue Lake, passing cascade blueberry bushes and small meadows filled with young conifers and Sitka mountain ash. Enjoy berry picking in the summertime and the vibrant colors of the blueberry bushes and mountain ash in the fall.  Soon a swath of tall, older conifers appears with thick, rivulet-studded bark and high boughs climbing up on their tiptoes towards the sky. Catch your first glimpse of the imposing rock walls encircling Blue Lake at the 0.7 mile mark, and begin descending about 60 feet in elevation to the northern part of the lake. This section is just slightly steep with exposed roots that can get muddy and slippery: lend a helping hand to those who might need it descending and then re-ascending the trail here.Arrive at the lake after hiking 0.85 miles from the parking lot. Here you can take a short, steep spur trail on your right down to the water where there are some rocks for sitting. However, a better spot for resting, picnicking, enjoying views of the lake and dipping toes in the water lies about a quarter mile south at an elevated mound flanked by long shallow rocks jutting out into the lake.  If you plan to head to this area, take care to stay on the trail closest to the lake to help prevent further erosion of the trails and meadows here.  There are several short social trails within this area, most leading to campsites, water sources, and brushy dead ends.  Fly amanita mushrooms, with their round, white-flecked reddish-orange caps, grow here too and are fun to spot; however, refrain from picking and consuming them: they are poisonous.Brook trout, a colorful fish with distinct red dots and a flaming yellowish orange underbelly, are abundant in Blue Lake. The Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife encourages fishing here to help keep their population manageable; however, anglers are limited to five fish each in accordance with the Department’s fishing guidelines. A Washington State fishing license is required for fishing at Blue Lake.EXTENDING YOUR HIKE: Explore the Dock Butte trail to catch a glimpse of Mount Baker or to head up to the summit of Dock Butte for a two-for-one hike. From Blue Lake, hike back to the intersection with the Blue Lake/Dock Butte sign, following the arrow for the Dock Butte trail. To catch a glimpse of Mount Baker, ascend about a quarter mile and 250 feet in elevation. The views of Mount Baker only get better from here, so if you’re feeling hardy, continue on to the Dock Butte summit. Taking the Dock Butte trail to the summit will add roughly 4.0 miles roundtrip and 1500 feet in elevation gain to your Blue Lake hike."

Through groves of old-growth conifers, over cascading creeks, and hugging the lush banks of the Gray Wolf River, the trail marches up a quiet canyon in the Buckhorn Wilderness. Plenty of good picnic sites, too, can be found along the tumbling, churning river. And there's always an excellent chance of spotting a big critter along the way.A new beginning and an abrupt ending have changed this trail considerably since the 1990s. From the small parking lot, start downhill on new trail, formerly a logging road. A series of slides forced this reroute. The new trail starts away from the river, but its slope-side route provides some nice views of Maynard Mountain and the portal to the Gray Wolf Canyon.After 0.5 mile of gentle walking, enter mature forest. The Cat Creek Loop Trail takes off to the left. An alternative route, it drops steeply through an ancient cedar grove, and then follows a portion of the old Gray Wolf Trail to return to the main trail about 0.5 mile farther. It's worth the walk, increasing the sweat factor only slightly.The main trail leaves the old roadbed, entering a cool old-growth forest of fir and hemlock and accelerating its drop to the river. At 1.5 miles enter the Buckhorn Wilderness, the river growing louder. Finally reach the wild waterway and traverse a sun-kissed bottomland that invites naps and snack breaks.At 2.5 miles leave the river bottom to climb diagonally up a steep hillside. A few breaks in the trees provide views up to lofty Gray Wolf Ridge and down into the canyon. Dropping back to river level, feel a cool breeze embrace you as the trail heads along the surging waterway. At 3.5 miles, after some of the nicest riverside hiking on this side of the Olympics, the trail once again climbs a steep hillside.Enjoy good views of the Gray Wolf crashing through a tight canyon gorge. Make your way back to river bottom, and at 4.2 miles call it quits as the trail ends at a narrow gorge that once housed a high bridge. Noted Olympic guidebook writer and legend Robert Wood once observed, ""The bridge was built high enough to preclude its destruction from floods.""This was probably the only time Mr. Wood wasn't correct-a torrent in the early 1990s washed it away.Fording the river here is extremely dangerous. If you want to further explore the Gray Wolf Valley, use the Slab Camp Creek Trail. But that's for another time. Right now, sit by the lovely waterway, letting its rapids mesmerize and its resident dippers entertain you."

Rife with wildflowers, fascinating geology, and just enough elevation gain to keep it interesting, this hike has just about everything that the Teanaway is known for. From the Stafford Creek Trailhead, the trail starts out in dry forest. The light brown soil and small plants speak to the relative aridity of this area. But that doesn’t mean there isn’t life. Flora abounds here, in an almost unbelievable variety of wildflowers. Scarlet gilia, pearly everlasting, lupine, penstemon of various types, cow parsley, tiger lilies, desert parsley, Indian paintbrush, anemone, Jeffrey's shooting stars, glacier lilies, yarrow, and a host of other wildflowers keep hikers company as they walk along this trail. The babbling of Stafford Creek provides the soundtrack, at least for the beginning of this hike. After about half a mile of creekside strolling, though, the trail zig zags away, up a steep switchback; a reroute after an avalanche took out a section of trail. Proceed along this section of trail, which lunges upward quite aggressively through two switchbacks before leveling out and then losing elevation to rejoin the creek about a mile in. From here the grade becomes more moderate, as you gradually climb through meadows, past views of the creek, and beautiful fields of flowers. About three and a half miles in, a ‘T’ junction appears where the trail crosses Stafford Creek to the left and the right-hand trail turns away from the creek. Refill your water bottle here, and consider reapplying sunscreen. You’ve been hiking along a very exposed trail and there’s more of the same ahead of you. Continue on the right-hand trail, (the one that heads away from the creek) and begin switchbacking uphill. Here the trail is redolent with that signature Teanaway smell: ponderosa pine, yarrow, and sun-warmed earth. Breathe it in deeply–-it’s one of the best parts about this hike. Five miles in you will reach a large meadow, where there may be tents dotting the ground. Due to the nearby stream, this is a popular camping area, and people make base camp here for long weekends in the Teanaway, including cross-country hiking, ridgeline wandering, and peak-bagging. But this lush meadow doesn’t mark the end of your hike. You have just a bit further on before reaching the pass.Wind around the right-hand edge of the campground and head up, crossing the stream and entering a moonscape of dark gray granite mixed in with green serpentine, the signature rock of this area. To the west, Earl Peak looms ahead of you, and a red butte flanks it to the south–-iron in the dirt here makes for colorful, highly photogenic mountains. Continue through the rocky fields for less than a mile and follow the trail across a small alpine glade to your destination. Your last steps into the pass reveal an exclamation-inducing sight: Mount Stuart juts into the sky directly in front of you, along with the rest of the Stuart Range. Take in this view or peer down the Ingalls Creek Valley to the east. WTA Pro Tip: A trail to your right promises better vantage points of this area, but take note; this is the way to Navaho Peak, and once you’ve started for the peak, it will be hard to stop short of it. It’s a steep mile to the summit, but if you feel up to it, the views are even better from there."

But for peak-baggers, or those simply interested in getting a gorgeous view from a relatively easy-to-navigate peak, the views are worth the extra effort. After climbing to Navaho Pass, it’s almost intuitive to begin wandering up the climber’s trail to Navaho Peak. The pass itself is beautiful, with views of the Stuart Range and Earl Peak filling your view. But it’s small, with not much room to spread out, and many a hiking group looking for a better lunch spot has found themselves climbing toward Navaho Peak. Head east out of the pass, paralleling the Stuart Range as you go. The trail is more or less straight up; a true climber’s trail. The loose scree and soil is anchored somewhat in place by various wildflowers, including Indian Paintbrush and pentstemon, as well as phlox. These provide a welcome distraction from the continuous uphill plodding, as do the ever-improving views of the Teanaway, Central Washington sprawling beneath you, and the gray, snow-dotted peaks to the north. It’s a mile of climbing to reach the small summit of Navaho Peak, barely higher than a small rocky outcropping just to the east. Snow lingers up here into July, which can make the final push to the summit a bit of a route-finding endeavor, but once you’ve attained the summit, put on your windbreaker and enjoy the views. Play a peak identification game: how many of the surrounding summits can you name? Rainier and Adams make appearances on clear days, but even Mount Stuart can be hard to identify from this angle. Below you, the County Line Trail stretches away, down the Ingalls Creek valley into Chelan county, inviting even more exploration in the form of multi-day adventures. WTA Pro Tip: The summit of Navaho Peak only has room for about four or five people to sit comfortably, so if it’s a weekend, share the summit with other hikers who have made the same trek as you."

A little further up is a well-signed junction with the Climbers' Trail which takes off to the right while you head left to follow the Heliotrope Ridge trail.Almost immediately you'll come to Heliotrope Creek, the most serious water crossing on the trail. Caution is well warranted here: the water is moving fast, the rocks are slick, and the pools deeper than they look. Real injuries have occurred here, so assess your abilities carefully, and be especially cautious with children and dogs. If proceeding with a dog, consider looping their leash around the chest (under their armpits) and securing into a make-shift harness. If the dog slips and is swept downstream, you don't want your only contact point to be the collar around their neck. And if crossing with a leashed/harnessed dog, remember to plant your own steps carefully, so that a slip by the dog doesn't pull you off balance. For bipeds, throwing gear at the problem can be helpful, so trekking poles are highly recommended here, and maybe pack in water shoes, sandals or full-on rain boots (in a plastic bag, as they'll be wet when you go to stuff them back into your pack) as well as a change of socks in case the rain boots are suddenly not as tall as they seemed back home. Again, please note that if crossing in the morning, there will always be more water later in the day.From Heliotrope Creek it's a short meadow walk to Heliotrope Ridge adjacent to the Coleman Glacier's lateral moraine with Mount Baker rising above. Here the glacier is a jumble of seracs (giant chunks of ice cleaving and tumbling in the slow progression of the glacier), and as the summer goes on, taller and taller ""sun cups."" These are formed when specks of dirt blown onto the snow absorb a little more sunlight than the snow around them and melt a tiny ways into the snow. Eventually, this cycle produces the giant, craggy spikes before you. Looking down into a particularly deep crack or sunlit opening in the ice offers a glimpse of the bluest icy blue to be had. (If it were a crayon color, it'd be called Glacier Blue.) Don't stare directly at it for too long, lest you too get pulled in by its mysterious draw, soon shopping for crampons and a course on glacier travel. From this close, you might hear the glacier creaking and cracking as it slides (glacially... haa, ok) downhill. No matter how solid it seems or how tempting the photo-op, please don't set foot on the snow -- it really is moving and can crack and shift unpredictably.Alternate Objective: for those with kids, dogs, or who just don't feel comfortable crossing Heliotrope Creek (there's no shame in ever making a call on the side of safety), consider backtracking to the Climbers' Trail junction and exploring that a bit. True to form, the Climbers' Trail climbs steeply and directly up the neighboring Hogsback Ridge and gains elevation quickly. The payoff of course is that within minutes, you're looking right at Mount Baker in its full, unobstructed glory. The higher you go, the bigger the views, and you can reach the Coleman Glacier here too at around 6000 feet. As before, please do not step onto any glacier if not roped and packing the skills to manage a crevasse fall -- this is a real-deal active glacier and should be taken seriously.From the entire ridge though, the views are remarkable: you can't get any closer to Mount Baker without technical gear, and from this height, you can look down to see where the Heliotrope Ridge Trail meets the glacier a short ways after the creek. Below too stretches the upper lengths of Heliotrope Creek, building momentum for all who dare take it on. Though it's hard to take your eyes off of Baker, behind you stretches a panorama of peaks, forest, and lowland valleys. This is one of the finest views to be had in the Mount Baker area.If you can manage the weight and feel like making someone's day, consider packing an icy Coke to hand to some exhausted climber working their way down under a heavy pack. Easy opportunities to make someone that happy are rare.WTA Pro Tip: To cap off this good day, it's hard to beat the North Fork Brewery (Beer Shrine) in Deming for their well-made pizza, startling beer selection and on-tap root beer."

While the Grand Ridge trail starting from Obstruction Point is listed elsewhere on this website, the eastern half of the Grand Ridge Trail, starting from Deer Park, is listed here as a separate day hike to make the relevant information and trip reports easier to find.The trailhead is clearly marked “Obstruction Point Trail – Obstruction Point 7.6 m” on the west side of Deer Park Road just before the parking lot by the usually unstaffed Ranger Station.  The trail starts at approximately 5300 feet, descends through mixed forest to 4900 feet in the first half mile, then starts to climb to forest-clad Green Mountain. The trail passes at 5500 feet below the summit of Green Mountain (5622 feet), continuing through mixed subalpine forest. As you hike through the forest, there are occasionally views to the south, and later to the north, that give an inkling of the broader vistas to come. You may also notice an area of burnt forest adjoining the trail on the south side –- it is more obvious on the return than on the outward journey.  As you traverse Green Mountain, the forest occasionally opens to small meadows with blueberries and wildflowers. Finally the forest ends and you enter the broad meadows of Maiden Peak with grasses and wildflowers. Fantastic views in all directions now start to open up with every step. To the north and northeast are the Strait of Juan de Fuca, Vancouver Island, Canadian peaks, and Mount Baker and Mount Shuksan hovering like a shimmering mirage over the hulk of nearby Blue Mountain. You can look back over the forest of Green Mountain and see the scar of Deer Park Road on Blue Mountain.Straight ahead as you emerge from the forest is a rocky peak, the first sub-peak (6319 feet) of Maiden Peak. The trail traverses the meadow to the south of this peak, with views of the tree-clad valleys and ridges below including Grand Lake and Grand Valley, and a panorama of the Olympic mountains to the south, including The Needles, Deception Peak, Mount Cameron, and Elk Mountain. To the east, Glacier Peak towers over the Cascades.  As you round the first sub-peak, you now see the second, true summit of Maiden Peak (6434 feet). The trail traverses 200 feet below this peak on the south side. There is no official trail or sign to get to the top and the wildflower meadows are fragile to degradation if people go off-trail. There is a faint boot path that people have used to scramble to the top. The summit is marked by a USGS survey marker. Caution is required given the steep cliffs on the north to northeast side of the peak. Once at the top, the views are all-round and even more expansive. For those who turn back from this point, the hike is 7.1 miles round trip.It is worth continuing on the main trail past the third sub-peak (6380 feet) of Maiden Peak and descend to the saddle between Maiden Peak and Elk Mountain. This has especially spectacular views of the north face of Elk Mountain, and a closer look south into Grand Valley. There is a short section of narrow trail across a steep scree slope that may be challenging for acrophobes, but those who persevere will find the sign for Roaring Winds camp (6000 feet) at the lowest point of the saddle. From here one can look up to the Grand Ridge trail winding up the steep slopes of Elk Mountain, as well as look north to Mount Angeles, Klahhane Ridge, Hurricane Ridge Road and the strait of Juan de Fuca. Roaring Winds (4.5 miles) provides a satisfying point for day hikers to turn back and enjoy this hike’s spectacular views from the other direction.Wildlife sightings reported for this hike include horned larks, hawks, chipmunks, marmots, deer, and bears.  There is no water on the trail, and a large part of the trail is exposed, so bring plenty of water."

But the views are incredible; just don’t let the short mileage fool you, and plan on spending a few extra hours tackling this one.From the beginning this trail is a challenge. It’s rough and difficult, traveling through young forest and clearcuts into older stands of cedar and Douglas fir that proved too difficult to log off the steep slopes. The first mile sees the most elevation gain, with the trail eventually leveling out at the first view of Index and the top of Persis. From there, traverse along the ridgeline, through talus fields and thinning trees before beginning the final leg of the hike. Push upward past two small lakes to the ridge that runs between Persis and Index. Veer left to climb to the top of Persis.Once you reach the summit of Persis, soak up the expansive views. Neighboring Index is massive. Pick out Baring, Mt. Baker, Gunn Peak, and Mt. Rainier. The exposed granite of the Index Town Wall is easy to spot above the miniature town of Index, and Heybrook Ridge sits just under Mt. Baring. The 360-degree views offer plenty to see before starting the steep slog back down the mountain."

Over the years, Shuksan’s gentle nature won the heart of Kulshan and drove Tahoma to jealous rage. She moved south, but finding herself separated from her family, she grew taller and taller in order to keep Kulshan within sight.Kulshan, or Koma Kulshan, meaning “snow-capped mountain with a wound at the tip” in Lummi, or “hunting place in the mountains” in Nooksack, was named Mount Baker by George Vancouver in honor of his third-in-command in 1792. Thanks to Forest Service roads and the Skyline Divide trail, you can personally witness the beauty that drove Tahoma to jealous eruptions. The Skyline Divide is a 6000-foot-high northward extension of Koma Kulshan that transforms itself into a summertime paradise of unrivaled mountain views and unending wildflower fields.The hike starts at a well-marked trailhead kiosk. Bring water with you, as there are no sources on the trail once snows have melted. Sunscreen is advisable, too, as the way is somewhat exposed. The trail gains 1500 feet in two miles to reach the ridgeline, so the grade is moderately steep as you ascend through a forest of western hemlock, mountain hemlock, and silver fir. Foamflower blooms in the summer, and huckleberries ripen late in the hiking season. Loving trailwork from the WTA has led to steps and turnpikes that allow this trail to withstand up to 5000 pairs of boots each year. When you approach the timberline (elevation 5900 feet), fields of wildflowers bloom and views of Kulshan peek through the trees, but you ain't seen nothin’ yet!Burst out onto a knoll on the ridgeline, with Kulshan confronting you to the south. Kulshan’s second wife, the non-volcanic Shuksan, is to the east, and the High Divide is to the north. The trail forks left, leading to potential campsites. Continue right and pass into the Mount Baker Wilderness. The hike continues 2.5 more miles on the gently rolling ridgeline over a series of five more knolls. At the second knoll, there is a fork. The path to the left takes you higher on a more difficult track, whereas the path to the right has more stable footing. At the third knoll, you face a similar left versus right decision. Regardless of your choice, the views are panoramic, and the flowers are ubiquitous. As you move southward, the views only get better as Kulshan looms larger and larger over the horizon. A partial list of the flowers that bloom on this part of the ridge includes aster, fireweed, arnica, oxeye daisy, lupine, valerian, bistort, glacier lily, and cow parsnip.At the fourth knoll, 3.5 miles from the trailhead (6000 feet elevation), cairns mark a key fork. The trail to the left goes to campsites one mile away near Deadhorse Creek in the valley between the Skyline and Cougar Divides. If you turn right, you will ascend the spines of the fifth and sixth knolls. The farther you go, the more likely you are to meet chipmunks and grouse. The flower population changes as the terrain becomes more rocky and wind-exposed. Look for St. John’s wort, monkeyflower, harebells, heather, phlox, campion, paintbrush, silky phacelia, and penstemon. How many hiking guide entries need two flower lists?As you summit the sixth knoll, you will reach 6,563 feet of elevation. Kulshan is just 3.5 miles from you. In front of you is Chowder Ridge, a trail best reserved for those with either hooves or the proper equipment for scrambling, snow, and ice. To the east are Yellow Aster Butte and Shuksan, and the North Cascades are in the distance. To your south are the Black Buttes (Lincoln and Colfax Peaks), the remnants of the local volcano that preceded Kulshan, and Twin Sisters Mountain. After you soak in the views, pull yourself away, if you can.WTA Pro Tip: Many choose to camp and include the night sky among the incredible views found at Skyline Divide. Potential sites include the first knoll (left turn after achieving the ridgeline) or the Deadhorse Creek campground area mentioned above. An information-gathering stop at the Glacier Public Service Center is also a nice addition."

In season, appreciate the great variety of wildflowers, beginning at the trailhead and continuing all the way to the summit. And be alert for birds and wild critters. They are out there.The first part of your trail is paved with large, loose cobbles as though a river bed had been dredged and the material deposited here. The footing is not the best, and the intention is not obvious. This was once the route of a makeshift road, and around 1905 ore was being hauled out here from mines up at the head of Bear Creek. (Yes, the creek and some small lakes at its head are ""Bear,"" while the mountain is ""Bare."") Initially, your route will cross several small gullies, each a few feet deep. In late spring or summer they may carry trickles of water that are easily stepped over, or they might be dry. Clearly, more significant flows sometimes occur.In about a half mile you will approach Bear Creek. Your trail heads upstream near the creek bank for a few feet on a section that sometimes is rooty and muddy. That will bring you to the first creek crossing.  When the water level is low you can cross easily on the rocks, but early in the season or after a heavy rain you may have to brave a crossing on logs that can be wet. Check recent trip reports for up-to-date information about the crossing. Once you are across, the trail resumes slightly to the left of the logs and it heads directly away from the creek.Beyond the first crossing of Bear Creek the cobbles paving the trail seem to get smaller, and the footing becomes more comfortable. A second crossing comes up soon, this time on a rustic wooden bridge that is showing its age but is quite serviceable.The trail continues on, now free of cobbles. Occasionally, it will seem rooty and it does have a few stone steps. Eventually, you will emerge from the forest onto treeless slopes. While much of the ongoing route may be bare of trees, it is not bare of other vegetation. In late spring and early summer the trail may be edged with head-high bracken fern and cow parsnip, and they can be very wet from dew or recent rain. You might find trekking poles useful here, not just for balance but to push the overhanging growth aside so you can see the trail and avoid tripping on an occasional root or stone, or stepping into one of those small holes where water, or critters, have penetrated the tread.Eventually, the trail passes above a boulder field strewn with the remains of several very old and weathered logs; debris from some long-forgotten avalanche. A few yards farther along, the main trail makes a very sharp switchback to the left, and a faint path continues on straight ahead. It offers a route for hikers intent on exploring the old mine sites at the head of Bear Creek. You, however, will take the switchback; it is the route to the summit. Take the switchback and continue climbing. There will be more switchbacks--according to a Forest Service count there are 46--interspersed with traverses of varying length. Occasional short sections of the trail pass though shady forest but much of it is on open slopes with low bushes, so it can become very warm on a sunny afternoon. Carry plenty of water!As you progress upward the views become more expansive. Around the 4,400-foot level the summit dome of Mt. Rainier rises up over hills to the south. At about the 4,800-foot level the trail crests a ridge where a very short side trail leads to a rocky viewpoint that offers a dramatic view down on the larger of the two Paradise Lakes, with Bench Lake up on a low bench just beyond it. The smaller Paradise Lake lies to the left, slightly lower down and mostly obscured by trees, but a close look will reveal a small part of it. Some maps seem to label  the smaller Paradise Lake incorrectly as Bench Lake, but just remember that Bench Lake is the highest of the three, and its up on that small bench. The lakes will be partially visible from the summit too, but the best views are here at the ridge-top vantage point.Return to the main trail and resume your ascent. There's a bit more uphill--another 500 feet or so--and more switchbacks before you reach the summit block. The last few feet may seem more like a scramble, but they are easily negotiated. The summit, at 5,353 feet, is somewhat flattened, and it was once home to a fire lookout. The lookout cabin, built in 1935, was decommissioned and destroyed in 1973. Only hints of it remain today. For a photo of the lookout in its heyday, check www.firelookout.com/wa/baremtn.html.The views from the summit in every direction are amazing. Clouds permitting, look for Mount Rainier in the south, Glacier Peak and Mount Baker in the north and the Olympics in the far west. Much nearer, Mount Phelps with its horn-shaped peak rises up to the northwest, while the rounded form of Goat Mountain and the rougher summit of Twin Peaks dominate the near view to the southwest. The southeast skyline displays the incredible line of rugged peaks extending northward from Snoqualmie Pass.You may see a hawk soaring below you, seeking prey on the open slopes. And sometimes a swallow will swoop past the summit, seeking its own lunch of insects. Some trip reports mention sightings of deer, or even a bear, on the slopes far below. In season, you will find wildflowers all along your route. Among the many others, look for columbine and tiger lily, plus a lot of rosy spirea. The summit block often sports some colorful Indian paintbrush. The flora are visited by many bees, and by some beautiful butterflies. Later in the season note the red berries of mountain ash. And in late summer be alert for ripe blueberries, although between the hikers and the bears they tend to disappear quickly.In the fall, the blueberry leaves turn a deep red offering a sharp contrast to the greens of spring and summer. It's worth doing the hike both in the spring and in the fall to experience Bare Mountain in these different hues."

Take five days (or seven!) and enjoy some of the best backcountry in the state. Along the way, you'll see massive wildflower meadows, glaciers, alpine lakes, high mountain passes and supreme views of Glacier Peak.Start along the popular Spider Meadow-Phelps Creek trail (also written up here as a dayhike). Follow Phelps Creek for a long, but relatively easy five miles to the mile-long expanse of Spider Meadow. This is a favorite destination of weekend backpackers, so you may wish to camp further along -- either in Phelps Basin at the far end of the meadow or in one of the camps near the tarns at the base of Spider Glacier.At the end of Spider Meadow, choose the steep trail to the left to ascend to Upper Lyman Lakes. It's steep, but it's just a warm-up for the most harrowing part of the loop. Bringing trekking poles or an ice axe is highly recommended for climbing up Spider Glacier (if the snow has melted out, you can also pick your way to the right of the glacier over rocks) to Spider Gap (your high point at 7100 feet).There is a boot-beaten path from the Gap as you head down to Upper Lyman Lakes, which can be quite treacherous when snow or ice-covered. Make sure to time your trip late enough in the summer to make it down safely -- or turn around at Spider Gap.There are plenty of campsites around Lyman Lake (elev. 5500 feet), and it provides a good basecamp for exploring the area. Take short sidetrips to Lyman Falls or hike down the trail to large Hart Lake and relax on its pebbly shore. Or push on -- there's still plenty to see on the loop. Cloudy Pass is another 1.5 miles past Lower Lyman Lake, and Suiattle Pass another mile beyond that. Note that water may be limited in this area late in summer, so be sure to stock up at Lyman Lakes. By the time you reach Suiattle Pass, the views have really opened up. Enjoy in-your-face views of the wilderness around you, especially of the mountain it's named for, Glacier Peak. At the pass, you join with the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) for a few miles of sensory overload. One sidetrip to seriously consider is Image Lake. While it's about a seven-mile roundtrip detour, the path and the destination are completely worth it. Photographers from far and wide have been known to make the trek to Image Lake to capture Glacier Peak reflected in its calm waters. Whether you take the detour or save Image Lake for another day, continue on the loop, following the PCT and crossing Miners Creek until you reach a junction with Trail 789, which leads to Buck Creek Pass. You'll be tempted again with sidetrips up Middle Ridge and Flower Dome, both worthy destinations. After exploring Buck Creek Pass, it's a long 9.6 miles back to the trailhead near the Phelps Creek Campground and another three miles along the road back to your car."

The lake is a great day hike in summer or fall and accessible by snowshoe in the winter. Wildflowers abound in early summer, berries in late summer and fall colors make vivid surroundings in autumn. Valhalla is a popular destination in winter as well, though the access point and the route are very different; see our Hiking Guide entry for Lake Valhalla Snowshoe for further details on this route. In summer, there are two ways to access Lake Valhalla, either via the Smithbrook Trail #1590, or from Stevens Pass using a section of the PCT. Both routes offer similar elevation gain; the Smithbrook route starts at 3800 feet, just 200 feet lower than the Stevens Pass route. However, the Stevens Pass route is longer, while the Smithbrook route is more kid-friendly. Approaching Lake Valhalla from the Smithbrook trail, the grade is modest, and while there is plenty to look at, the round-trip distance is moderate. The trailhead has an ample parking area off Forest Service Road 67. A recent reworking of the trail starts off with gentle switchbacks. After you cross the wilderness boundary, keep your eyes peeled for the 8-foot diameter Douglas fir that fell across the trail a few years ago. This tree was too big to cut with a crosscut saw so it was cleared using blasting.  The trail continues up to Union Gap where it meets the PCT. In August and September, you will frequently meet PCT thru-hikers as they head north to Stehekin and the end of their journey at the Canadian Border. They are generally friendly and happy to share their stories for a few minutes, particularly if you have some fresh fruit or cookies to share. After conversing with thru-hikers, turn south at Union Gap and climb gently to the gap between Mounts Lichtenberg and McCausland where you get your first glimpse of Lake Valhalla, shining in the cirque below. Just before reaching the gap, a boot trail follows the ridge up to an old lookout site at Mount McCausland. Less then a half a mile and 600 feet of climbing are rewarded with a great view of Glacier Peak to the north. There are lots of huckleberries in the meadows along this trail.Pass over the gap and descend to Lake Valhalla. There are a number of overnight campsites and a couple of backcountry toilets at the lake, though please note that no campfires are permitted. There is a very pleasant sandy beach, perfect for lunch. Small 4-or 5-inch cutthroat jump along the shore trying to catch the bugs skimming the lake surface.If you're looking for a longer hike, start from the Stevens Pass parking lot on the north side of the highway, behind the power station that feeds the Ski Area. The first mile of the trail is along an old rail bed, used before tunnels were dug to route the railway under Stevens Pass.  If you look carefully, you can see where the railroad switchbacked up from Yodelin. Watch the downhill side and you will see the clearly graded roadbed ascending, although it has lots of trees growing on it now. The trail continues along the rail bed for another 500 yards or so, where the train was backed in to clear the switchback, before proceeding up and over the pass.  As the rail bed section of the trail ends, head away from the noise of Highway 2 and into a series of meadows. This is a beautiful section of trail, providing a good example of what hikers will find if they continue north on the PCT. A modest grade with well-maintained tread, wildflowers, huckleberries, and good views awaits you here. Mount Lichtenberg looms large above as you climb up to the basin where Lake Valhalla is tucked. This route is 10 miles roundtrip and offers 1000 feet of elevation gain.WTA Pro Tip: Thru-hike the trails to Lake Valhalla using a key swap! Using two groups of hikers, have one group start at Smithbrook and the other at Stevens Pass. Meet in the middle for a picnic at the lake, then swap car keys, and continue on to the trailhead that the other group departed from. This makes for a 9.9-mile long dayhike for both groups through a wide variety of terrain and views."

And despite being begun in 1989, it’s still not complete!The trail itself is unremarkable, but after reading the history of the sculpture, you may agree that it’s worth the stop, and the short hike to see it up close.The sculpture was designed and created by Chewelah sculptor David Govedare. He envisioned a 36-foot tall woven basket made of steel, tipped up by Grandfather (a symbol of the Great Spirit), to allow the 18 horses within to run free.The sculpture was to be completed and then presented as a gift during Washington’s Centennial celebration in 1989. The state ceded the land to Grant County for that purpose, but fundraising from private donations fell short and there was never enough money to complete the project. The 15 life-size galloping horses that were installed are a beautiful sight, regardless of the original plan. The sculpture as a whole is best seen from a distance. If you choose to take the short hike to the hilltop to see the individual horses, you’ll be rewarded with a nice view of the Columbia River and surroundings.From the far end of the paved parking lot, set out up the obvious trail heading up to the left of the sculpture. There are other faint trails visible, but please stay left on the main trail to minimize further erosion. The way is moderately steep, with sand and loose rocks; a hiking staff or trekking poles are helpful. A mere two tenths of a mile later, you are on top of the plateau featuring fifteen wild horses frozen in mid-gallop.The individual horses are best viewed in profile. The rust that has formed does not detract, but graffiti sometimes does.  There is plenty of room to wander among them for a whole new perspective, offering a variety of options for the photographer. View the horses in profile from the back side, with the Columbia River (actually Wanapum Lake) providing a sparkling backdrop. Or, if you can time it right, capture the horses in silhouette before a brilliant sunset."

With towering granite peaks, forests, meadows, wildflowers, and of course the beautiful mountain lake surrounded by granite that reaches for the sky, this short hike is easily a classic and should be on your must-hike list. With only 1050 feet of elevation gain this hike is doable for almost everyone. If you’re driving over Highway 20 and don’t have all day, stop for this mountain gem.With the trailhead parking lot right off the highway, you will waste no time getting onto the trail. Start off with a small dip in elevation to a short boardwalk. This is the first of several short boardwalks you will traverse into a friendly forest. At a quarter mile, the boardwalks end and you get your last glance at the highway. Though you can’t see it past this point, you may be able to hear the cars passing on the road for a little while more. Don’t worry, the sound will fade away and you will soon forget all about cars and highways as you gaze at the beauty of the North Cascades. Let the sounds of the trail stir your curiosity, In the summer the trail may be dusty, but there is ample shade as you trod the cushy path through a rocky forest. Emerging into a meadow a little under halfway there, start looking for wildflowers such as Cascade Azalea or Lupine. Also, keep an eye out for the Early Winters Spire with its massive granite peaks. This is a popular climbing location that is part of the nearby Liberty Bell group. If you see any climbers they are most likely heading that direction.From the meadow you pass over a small creek and step back into the forest. The rest of the hike passes fairly quickly as you skirt the Liberty Mountain Group. For the last half mile or so you may find keeping your eyes on the trail difficult to do as they are drawn to the sweeping views of Cutthroat Peak and Whistler Mountain on the northwestern side of Highway 20. Keep pushing on and when you hear a gentle trickling sound, you'll know you are close; this noise is coming from an outflow stream from Blue Lake. When you see the lake, continue right over Blue Lake’s outlet by carefully stepping on rocks or the makeshift log bridge. The logs can have some give, so be careful, but once you are over the creek you pass an old dilapidated log cabin. Explore the cabin and then perch yourself along the shore on a boulder for a snack and great views of this pristine mountain lake and a possible mountain goat sighting. If you are brave enough, take a plunge into the lakes icy waters or just cool your feet. WTA Pro Tip: Just 0.8 miles east from the trailhead on Highway 20 is the Washington Pass Lookout. If you have come this far and have the time, stop here for amazing views of the Liberty Mountain group from the side opposite that of Blue Lake. There is a short paved trail to the view point."

FR-9070 has its share of potholes and is usually snow-free from July until November. Park along the south side of FR-9070 across from a modest sign indicating trail #1348. There are no water sources on this hike, but the round trip is only three miles.Mount Catherine packs in 1,330 feet of elevation gain over 1.5 miles, so be prepared for a hike that climbs aggressively with switchbacks as it ascends the mountain’s southern flank. Catch your breath and note the western and mountain hemlock cones that line the trail. Subalpine fir is another resident of this neighborhood, occupying the more wind-exposed turns of the trail. Blowdowns occasionally pose obstacles along this trail.The first 0.7 miles of trail lift you up to the ridgeline at 4,700 feet of elevation, near the western side of the mountain. The trail then traces the ridgeline for 0.6 miles, heading east and climbing more gently. In the early summer this section of the trail may be partially covered by lingering snow. Over the last 0.2 miles, nearing the summit block, the trail turns north and views start to open. Mount Rainier looms over the horizon behind you. Circle around the summit block, turning east again, where you may encounter a snow bank in June and early July—cross carefully if there is snow, as there is nothing to stop your slide for more than 100 feet. Just beneath the summit, you may encounter a cable that can be used to assist in a brief scramble that gains the final 20 feet to the top. Alternatively, there are class 2-scramble bootpaths that reach the top.As you close in on the summit, huckleberry bushes line the trail. Berries tend to ripen in August and September. The rare and endangered Taylor’s checkerspot butterfly frequents this summit, too. When you reach the top, from left to right, Mount Rainier, Tinkham Peak, and Silver Peak dominate the view.

There is considerable elevation gain and loss -- about 16,000 feet! Some places are impassable until well into August when the snow melts out. And the distance requires hikers to carry six or seven days of food and arrange for a car shuttle or pick-up at Stevens Pass. It is best for hikers of this segment to pick up a map from the Pacific Crest Trail Association (www.pcta.org) and buy the Pacific Crest Trail Oregon & Washington guidebook by Jeffrey Schaffer and Andy Selters published by Wilderness Press.Note that the mileage for this hike entry is for a thru-hike from Snoqualmie Pass to Stevens, not a roundtrip hike."

Nearby destinations of interest include Mount Catherine, Tinkham Peak, Mirror Lake, and Twin Lakes. Silver Peak and its neighbors are reached by way of FR-9070, a gateway to the less-traveled but better-kept secrets of the Cascades. FR-9070 has its share of potholes and is generally snow-free from July until November. Approximately six miles from Hyak, FR-9070 reaches an intersection with the Pacific Crest Trail, at a saddle between Mount Catherine and Silver Peak.The most common direct route to Silver Peak follows the Pacific Crest Trail south for 1.7 miles and continues along a hard-to-spot side trail that turns 180 degrees and ascends the southern flank of Silver Peak. After parking along FR-9070, find the intersection with the Pacific Crest Trail (2000) at 3800 feet of elevation and head south. Salmonberry and blueberry bushes line your route. After it leaves the saddle, the Pacific Crest Trail gently gains elevation, then dips to cross the north fork of Cold Creek two tenths of a mile from the trailhead. The Pacific Crest Trail enters an alpine forest populated by noble fir, western hemlock, and mountain hemlock. The trail meanders through the forest southward past beargrass, arnica, bluebells, western columbine, foamflower, fireweed, cow parsnip, and milkweed that blossom in the summer. Bumblebees, chipmunks, hummingbirds, and pikas can be seen or heard along this section of the trail. Flies and mosquitoes can be bothersome in the summer months.1.7 miles from the trailhead, watch closely for a turn-off up and to the right, marked with cairns. If you pass a tarn on the left, you have gone too far. The side trail climbs steadily for three tenths of a mile to Abiel Pass, a saddle between Silver and Tinkham Peaks at 4600 feet of elevation. This section requires some brief moments of class 2 or 3 scrambling. At Abiel Pass, there is a fork in the trail. A turn to the left takes you toward the impressive summit of Tinkham Peak, which towers over Abiel Pass. Turn to the right (northwest) to go to Silver Peak. As you continue to ascend, the Cold Creek valley opens below you, with Mount Catherine facing you across the valley. You will then turn north and face views of Silver Peak’s summit. The trail descends briefly before reaching the final ascent to the summit.One-half mile from Abiel Pass the tread becomes rocky, and the incline becomes steep, gaining 600 feet over the last three tenths of a mile. Handholds are occasionally required, making for more class 2 scrambling. As you huff and puff your way to the summit, Mount Rainier rises above the horizon behind you. Blue harebells and arnica line the trail in the summer. Just as the trail levels off for a moment, deceiving you into a sense of completion, you round a bend with the summit in view. Don’t quit, as you are very close to panoramic views of Snoqualmie Pass. Stuart is to the east, and Rainier and Adams are to the south. Keechelus Lake is to the east, and Annette Lake lies just beneath you to the southwest. On a clear day, you can see north all the way to Mount Shuksan. Take care when you descend, as the rock can be loose in many places.WTA Pro Tip: August and September are the best months for ripe berry picking. Silver Peak goes well with nearby Tinkham Peak and Mount Catherine for combination hikes."

It begins at a junction, which may or may not be signed, with Rock Creek Trail No. 1509 just before it makes the final ascent to a saddle south of Carne Mountain.  The trail immediately crosses a pass to the east of Carne and begins a long descent into the headwaters of Box Creek.  At the crossing of a fork of Box Creek, the tread abruptly disappears, but the route goes straight up a meadow on the far side of the stream to where the trail resumes.  This meadow has a few camp sites at its lower end, with water throughout the summer.After climbing up to another meadowy basin on the northern fork of Box Creek, the trail turns abruptly west, then disappears again.  At this point, the best route is to ignore the disconcerting segment of trail altogether and instead to hike up toward an obvious pass at the creek's head.  The pumice barrens at the pass serve as a spectacular camp-site, and water is available just below the pass.  The trail again appears on the north side of the pass, dropping down to Chipmunk Creek, where it fades away yet again.  As before, climb up to the pass at the head of the basin.The next segment of trail is perhaps the most dangerous of the whole route.  There are two main options for crossing the next cirque: slide a thousand feet straight down the scree and pick up the trail on the basin floor, or follow a climbers' track up to a pass above the Ice Lakes.  At this point, one can hike down to Upper Ice Lake or follow a similar track the rest of the way across the scree and down a dusty ridge to the trail.  Along this portion of the trail, it is very helpful to have a pair of trekking poles, or perhaps an ice axe early in the season.From the junction of the upper and lower routes, the trail switchbacks down into the headwaters of Leroy Creek, skirting above and below cliffs and buttresses.  At the bottom, the tread is obscured by recent rockfall and washouts, but a few cairns lead downhill to a portion of the original trail which goes down and across one of the streams forming Leroy Creek.  From here, hikers must cut straight across the slope until they reach the brink of a nasty washout in the midst of the largest boulder field.  Scramble routes exist at both the upper and lower ends of this gully, but the lower one is probably easier and safer, especially when the upper end is filled with snow and ice.  More cairns guide the way to the far side of the rocks, where the tread picks up again.This part of the tread appears to get more use than the others, and continues uninterrupted down to the Phelps Creek Trail No. 1511.  There are several large campsites in Leroy Basin and just below it along the creek.  Leroy Basin itself is a spectacular spot, with scree and cliffs rising 3000 feet above to the craggy summits of Seven-Fingered Jack.Below the basin, the trail becomes well-traveled, steep, and incredibly dusty.  The last eruption of Glacier Peak dumped at least two feet of ash on this area, and it hasn't gone away.  It tends to swirl about the feet of passing hikers, turning their boots to chalky white.  The trail climbs down past Leroy Creek Falls and emerges onto the Phelps Creek Trail, unsigned except for the obvious: ""Trail Not Maintained""."

Multiday hikers use Spider Meadow as a first stop on backpacking trips into the beautiful areas to the east of Glacier Peak, and incorporate the trail in thru-hikes to Holden Village above Lake Chelan.As you head up the old mining road that makes up the first couple of miles of this hike, you will quickly come upon the first of approximately 16 seasonal creek crossings, most unnamed and not noted on most maps. This crossing gives you a good idea of conditions to come. Early in the season these crossings can make getting up to Spider Meadow a wet boot challenge, but take it slow and use your trekking poles. If you feel uncomfortable, there's nothing wrong with saving the trail for another day.Immediately past the creek crossing, the trail goes around a tight corner, opening up to fabulous views back on the glaciers that hang on Chiwawa ridge. Within a quarter mile, pass the Carne Mountain trail junction bearing up and to the right. Carne provides great views, beautiful larches in the fall and a very good workout--3500 feet in four exposed, south-facing miles.  As the trail climbs in shaded second-growth, you cross Box and Chipmunk creeks before arriving at Leroy Creek, the largest tributary of Phelps Creek. Just before Leroy Creek, the trail crosses a small unnamed creek. At this crossing, look for a large cement block and rusted piping that looks like it held a pelton wheel, a part for an old water turbine. This relic, in addition to distinct rock piles visible across Phelps Creek, are leftovers from the mining in this area in the 1920s.  Leroy Creek can be the most challenging stream crossing of the hike into Spider Gap. Once across, there is a signed, but unmaintained trail up Leroy Creek; this trail leads up to popular climbing routes to Mount Maude, Seven Finger Jack, and the Carne High Route.From Leroy Creek the trail frequently crosses meadows hollowed out of the forest by winter avalanches coming down from Phelps ridge to the west or off the Entiat Ridge to the east. These meadows provide bright splashes of sunlight and wildflowers to break up the forested trail.At 5.5 miles the trail breaks out at the base of Spider Meadow. Marmots whistle a welcome, wildflowers bob their heads in the meadow, and beautiful views roll out in front of you in all directions.   The trail continues on to the head of the meadow. In normal snow years, there are sometimes lingering slabs of avalanche snow well into August on the meadow floor. It is well worth the effort to hike up across the meadow and climb 300 feet to the junction of the Spider Gap trail. There is a fisherman’s trail that leads to the right, roughly 300 yards to Phelps Basin, a perfect place to have lunch."

The brother’s moved on and spent some time prospecting in nearby areas before passing by again in 1873. This time they struck it rich. Word of the brother’s find quickly spread, causing a mini gold rush in the area. By 1876 many miners that had rushed to the Liberty area had left for gold rushes in other states, but many local families that had homesteaded in the area stayed on. The population that eventually became the town of Liberty was originally located around a spot where two gold-bearing creeks converged. When a local miner named Thomas Meagher built a cabin and established a store a couple miles east of that convergence most of the residential activity was relocated to be closer to the store. The resulting town became known as Meaghersville. In 1890 the miners built a wagon road to improve access to the town. In 1892 a post office was established. The citizens wanted to officially name the town Swauk after nearby Swauk Creek, but the US Postal Service denied the name fearing that it would be confused with the already established Sauk Post Office. At a town meeting the miners eventually settled on calling their new town Liberty. Eventually gold deposits in the Liberty area began to dwindle and people began to leave to seek their fortunes elsewhere. However the town still has a small population of residents today, making Liberty what is referred to as a “living ghost town”. There is still some gold to be found around Liberty and mining activity has continued in the area to the present day. The gold in the Liberty area is unique. Not only does it occur as lode gold (microscopic amounts of gold mixed with rock and other minerals) that is mined from hard rock mines, it is also found in streams in a crystalline form called wire gold, and in nugget form. In 1974 the town of Liberty was added to the National Register of Historic Places. There are many historic buildings in the town that can be seen and photographed as well as interpretive signs and displays of mining equipment from the towns distant past. There is no formal trail through Liberty, but the open landscape makes it easy to navigate. Since it begins by the roadside, it’s a perfect exploration for all ages and abilities. If you visit, be sure to respect the private property of those still living in this historic town."

The town was founded in 1893 at the west portal of the Cascade Tunnel along the Great Northern Railway. The town included a train depot that was unfortunately destined to become the site of the deadliest avalanche in US history. On March 1, 1910, a passenger train and a mail train were stuck at the Wellington Depot waiting out a blizzard that had been raging for nine days. During the night, while most people were sleeping, an avalanche hit the trains and the station quickly sweeping everything about 150 feet downhill into the Tye River valley.  96 people were killed in the event. Only 23 survived. In October of 1910 Wellington was quietly renamed Tye to ease the fears of travelers who would forever associate the name Wellington with this tragic event.In the same month that the town was renamed work began on the snowsheds designed to protect the rails and passing trains from future avalanches. Some of these sheds are still standing today. Tye was abandoned in 1929 when the second Cascade Tunnel, which is still in use today, was completed negating the need for trains to pass through the town.To reach Wellington you will follow the original path of The Great Northern Railroad along what is now the eastern portion of the iron goat trail near Stevens Pass. Head east on the trail from the parking lot to see old foundations and the west entrance to the original Cascade Tunnel. Walk west from the parking lot to enter the snow sheds and reach the site of the 1910 avalanche.WTA Pro Tip: Gary Krist's 2008 book 'The White Cascade' chronicles the historic avalanche for anyone interested in more information on the history of this particular area."

The town became a victim of both technological progress and the needs of a much larger municipality. By 1908 the town was home to around 250 residents. In addition to the residents’ homes the town had a hotel, roundhouse, post office, general store, and a school. One resident fought hard for Lester to be recognized by Washington's historic register. Gertrude Murphy was one of the 26 people left living in the town by 1980. She had been a schoolteacher in Lester, but as the town dwindled, she became a champion for the town as well as a board member for the school. The school was closed in 1985, when the state legislature determined that the town was too small to operate a school, and Murphy worked full time to save Lester. In 1993, her home burned down, and she moved a mile and a half out of town into a cabin that she referred to as ""the suburb of Lester."" Murphy died in 2002, the last resident of Lester.All that remains of the town now is an eerie handful of dilapidated buildings and a large sign by the railroad's right-of-way that reads ""Lester"". The only way to Lester now is on foot, via a Forest Service road over Stampede Pass.By the 1940’s the rail line serviced by Lester was switching from steam to diesel locomotives. The new engines had no need to stop in Lester for fuel or supplies, which meant the town had lost a major source of income. The town began to decline. In the 1960’s the City of Tacoma sought to shut down Lester to protect the drinking water quality of the Green River Watershed, and by 1969 the city had purchased the land on which the town sat. The final nail in Lester’s coffin came in 1984 when the BNSF Railroad stopped using the rail line that ran through the town altogether. The line was reopened again in 1996, but by then the town was no more. To reach Lester you will hike a gently winding gravel road along the upper reaches of the Green River near Stampede Pass. The road takes you past an old logging campsite and landing area and a few foundations from associated buildings. Keep your eye out for interesting artifacts along the way. As you continue along they road you will cross the railroad tracks and arrive at the old town site. Two wooden buildings still stand on the south side of the tracks. Another has mostly collapsed under the weight of time and winter snows. Venture farther up the road and north through the woods to find several more structures and other items of interest."

You'll wander through a forest of moss-covered maple, cedar and fir, listening for wildlife and the sound of the river.This is a nice easy, flat walk any time of year, but it is outstanding as a fall or winter outing. Come in the rain and enjoy this one as moss drips off the trees, mushrooms pop up through the forest floor and clouds float among the low hills.Start with a small jaunt upstream, hiking along a beautifully graveled trail. A short way down the trail, reach a signed junction for Murphy Creek. This spur wanders through the woods, over a little bridge and between two large cedars, where there are some nice spots to view the river. Once you reach Murphy Creek, the trail ends and you rejoin the road. The creek isn’t much, just another little feeder stream heading to add its waters to the mighty Sauk. But it's pretty, and a nice option for little legs. Once back at the main graveled trail, follow it until it hits a regular dirt trail close to the river. The graveled trail is part of a new, one mile ADA loop, and worth taking for a short walk. To follow the trail along the river to the northern end, take the dirt path, along which you can hear the river, though it remains out of sight. Enjoy the moss draped trees and green carpeted forest floor. In spring, look for twinflower and trillium. In fall, the yellow of turning devils club foliage, bigleaf maple and golden brown ferns add a splash of color to the bright green moss. How many kinds and colors of mushrooms can you find along the path? Mushrooms love the decaying wood of old stumps and leaves found here. Since the river supports migrating steelhead, birders should keep an ‘eagle eye’ out for osprey and herons, and in the winter, eagles. Cross a wooden bridge, and catch a view of the river. There are lots of places to see its waters, and some access to its banks if you climb steeply down. This area was logged in the 1930s, and along this section one can see the remnants of old growth stumps, the springboard cuts barely visible. Notice some 100 foot tall trees that have grown from these old stumps. One grand old stump supports a vine maple, a hemlock, ferns and a huckleberry! Reach the end of the trail at the north parking lot and turn around. On your way back, you will come to the intersection with the ADA graveled trail. You have two choices. You can go left along the lower part of the loop, and come out where you started, or go to the right and wind through the trees upward to the main parking lot on a different route. Either way, it’s pretty and green. WTA Pro Tip:  Do you have out of town guests? Make this part of a Mountain Loop day. Pick up picnic supplies in Darrington, then come and walk the short graveled loop trail. Enjoy your lunch at the nice picnic tables here. Continue around the loop, showing off the great Northwest scenery. Stop frequently, take many pictures, then visit the Ice Caves and have dinner in Granite Falls."

If the Chiwawa River can't be safely forded, head to nearby Estes Butte or Basalt Peak instead, returning to Schaefer when river levels have subsided.Begin by immediately dropping to the lush Chiwawa River flat. Pass the horse ford, soon coming to the hiker ford. For many years you could easily cross the river here by picking your way across a large log jam. But recently the jam was reduced, leaving one or two flimsy logs spanning a deep pool. Don't attempt it. Instead, ford downriver from the jam on a wide, graveled, generally shallow area. Of course this is only safe usually during late summer and early fall. If the river level is high and the water is flowing swiftly, seek an alternative trip.Once safely across, follow the trail through about 0.5 mile of impressive cedars and cottonwoods and a ""jungle flat"" of dogwood thickets before leaving the flood plain. Cross a brushy avalanche slope before finally settling into good trail. Don't get too comfortable, though, for it's time to start climbing. Paralleling the Chiwawa River the way angles up steep slopes northward. A couple of creeks and window views out to Basalt Peak, Estes Butte, and up the Chiwawa Valley break the monotony of the climb.At about 2.5 miles the trail rounds a ridge, turning westward into a deep valley high above Schaefer Creek (elev. 3600 ft). Enter a grove of big spruce trees and commence climbing steeply once more. At 3.5 miles cross Schaefer Creek on a solid bridge (elev. 4100 ft). Now through thinning forest peppered with granite boulders and ledges, the way steepens yet again. At around 4 miles (elev. 4600 ft) is a ledge just off-trail that grants sweeping views of the Chiwawa Valley and the lofty ridges and peaks flanking it. Good spot for a water break.Climbing soon eases as the trail meets up once more with Schaefer Creek and enters the Glacier Peak Wilderness. At 4.75 miles reach placid and petite Little Schaefer Lake set amid moist meadows flourishing with flowers. Continue an easy 0.25 mile and reach big Schaefer amid more meadows and with a shimmering shoreline. Sit on a silver driftwood log, aching feet immersed in rejuvenating waters, and absorb the soothing beauty of your surroundings.

It's still dry, so pack plenty of water.The first 0.5 mile still follows an old mining road, traveling gently along Rock Creek. Then it's up, up, and away, climbing 2700 feet in 3.7 miles. Most of the way is forested-consider that a blessing, especially if eastside sun is shining. In May and June the forest floor is adorned in scads of pipsissewa (a wintergreen cousin called prince's pine back east) and wild ginger (a birthwort that tastes and smells like ginger, but beware: it's a diuretic and you'll be losing enough liquid on this hike by sweating!).Winding up the mountain, you'll periodically pass traces of the old trail. Teaser views are granted along the way, but the good show doesn't come until you reach the 5397-foot lookout knoll. Only the foundation remains of the lookout building, but there's still plenty to look out at. Take in an excellent view of the southern reaches of the Chiwawa Valley. Look west to the ridge of the same name and to Clark and Buck mountains farther out. Look east to Garland Peak and the Entiat Mountains. Enjoy the sun too-hopefully it's not too hot."

The first 5 miles are on well maintained trail passing through old growth with areas of blueberries and salmon berries.  The final assent is on fairly solid rock with scree in areas, bits of heather and blue berries, and a scattering of alpine trees gripping on here and there.  Some of the rock is smooth so, if wet, might be too slippery to climb without aid.The trailhead starts conveniently from the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) parking lot just off I-90.  The first 2.5 miles are on the PCT trail.  At the junction, stay left (the sign is missing) on the Commonwealth trail, #1033.  Continue for another 2.5 miles, first climbing gradually, then more steeply through a number of switchbacks.Continue up the ridge to the flat area (about 4850') below the west side of the peak.  About 50 yards before Red Pond, you'll see a well worn boot path going off to the right.  There's a small carn there, as well.  Continue on this boot path staying 50-100 yards to the left (i.e. north) of the W ridge.  Note that Fred Beckey recommends to ascend the SW ridge to the summit.  However, that is a bit steeper and more exposed than the W ridge.As you ascend, you'll probably lose and find your boot path - or is it a different boot path?  As long as you stay near the W ridge you'll be fine until you get within the last 300 or so vertical feet of the summit.  There, traverse to the left side (maybe by 100') of the actual summit and continue straight up.

The lake in a rocky basin, in the midst of this spectacular scenery. On some days you can hear ice echoing through the valley as it crashes down the face of Mount Shuksan. This is a late season hike, as snow can linger here into August.The trail begins just below Artist Point and is well marked from a paved parking lot. Start your hike by descending on switchbacks through sub-alpine forest. Soon you will reach a sign indicating you are entering the Mt. Baker Wilderness.After entering the wilderness, the trail briefly opens up to a picturesque alpine basin. As you descend, the trail levels out and you hike through boulder fields, dried-up creek beds, meadows, wildflowers, and clear running streams. This area is part of the headwaters of Swift Creek. As you look ahead of you, you will see Mount Shuksan and your destination across the basin. On your left is Shuksan Arm.Up to this point in the hike the trail can be rocky and root filled, but soon you will enter sub-alpine forest on an easy, level, and well maintained trail, catching peek-a-boo glimpses of Baker and Shuksan. The trail briefly breaks out into the open right before the Swift Creek trailhead. Here there is a privy available and you can see the unmaintained Swift Creek trail on your right. From this junction, you will start ascending, re-entering sub-alpine forest with views of Mount Baker.After re-emerging from the forest, look across the basin at your starting point. Here you'll have views of Artist Point, the Ptarmigan Ridge Trail, and spectacular views of Baker. Continue ascending on talus slopes, heather meadows, and rocky basins, listening for the squeak of pikas and whistles from marmots. Enjoy wildflower displays that surround you as your views of Baker start to recede. But never fear--soon you'll see the tops of Mount Shuksan and Fisher Chimney on your approach to the saddle above Lake Ann. The approach before the saddle can hold snowfields until well into August, so be prepared for snow travel.Peer down at Lake Ann from the saddle. As you continue down, Lake Ann will be on your right and you will come to a 'T'. The trail to the right will lead down to Lake Ann, complete with camping spots and a climber's path that will take you to the foot of Lower Curtiss Glacier; the Fisher Chimney climbing route for Mount Shuksan. The real prize at this junction of the trail is directly in front of you, though--an up-close and personal view of the west face of Mount Shuksan. Take in this awe-inspiring sight before continuing down to the lake or take the path to Lower Curtiss Glacier.If you continue to Curtiss Glacier, you will enter North Cascades National Park. As you skirt around the end of the valley you'll enjoy a view of Baker Lake on your right and another camping opportunity on the left.WTA Pro Tip: Lake Ann is a great hike, but due to the incredible views and relatively moderate trail, it can be quite crowded. If you're considering going, remember to abide by Leave No Trace ethics, particularly if your visit is an overnighter."

Appreciate the forest vegetation and wildflowers. Along the way, hear and perhaps see a variety of song birds and waterfowl.A glance at the Green Trails Map (204S) reveals a network of trails on Tiger Mountain's Tradition Plateau, and there are several options for a loop hike that has Tradition Lake as its center. Here, we describe a particular loop that many hikers will find the most rewarding. Your favorite guide book(s) might suggest minor variants that you also can explore.From the main parking lot, start out on the big wide trail that heads south then, almost immediately, turn right onto the signed Around the Lake Trail. The sign announces ""Tradition Lake 1.5 M,"" but the lake is much closer than that, only about 0.5 miles. Perhaps the sign makers were thinking of the shortest distance to hike all the way around the lake. A flyer is sometimes available at the trailhead, and if so it will offer comments on numbered sites you will pass along the way. In any event, the trail offers a nice forest walk, with a lot of ferns, moss, small stream crossings and occasional wildflowers. There are a few signs along the way that comment on the ecology, while some ground-level displays illustrate tracks of wild critters you might see (or might rather not see... )Soon enough, hints of Tradition Lake will begin to appear through the trees. Parts of the lake are covered with lily pads, and the surface often shows wind-generated ripples. A bit farther along you will come to a viewing platform that offers marginally better lake views, although even there trees restrict much of the view. You may see, or at least hear, waterfowl on the lake.As you continue a short way past the viewing platform you will come to a signed trail fork where the Around the Lake Trail heads off to the right That's an optional side trip you can take if you like. In about a quarter mile it would get you down close to water level at the west end of the lake, with a nice view looking east up the lake. But continuing beyond that point would take you well out of your way from today's route. So, if you elect to do that side trip, return here once you have enjoyed the lake view. Your ongoing main graveled trail bends around toward the south and soon meets up with the Bus Trail. The namesake bus, such as it is, lies on its side just a few feet to your left. There's not much to see, but you might as well take a quick look. Old buses, suitably altered, sometimes were used by loggers as kitchens and bunkhouses, and that may be what brought this one here to end its days -- and contribute a trail name -- in the Tigers.Once you have looked at the remains of the bus (or not) turn back west and continue on the Bus Trail. In 0.3 miles, cross over the route of a buried gas line, then reach a power line. At the power line, head right 200 feet to find the SE end of the Wetlands Trail. There's a big sign board there with a Green Trails Tiger Mountain map posted, so if your own map is buried deep in your daypack you can check your route here.The ongoing Wetlands Trail passes tiny Round Lake where the water level varies seasonally, and from year to year. You may hear the deep tones of a bullfrog and see occasional waterfowl. A number of signs along the way caution about staying on the main trail, and indicate some faint side trails that are closed. Continue on and, at a trail junction in about a quarter mile stay left, avoiding the right fork ""Wetlands Connector"" that leads to a power substation.In another 0.2 mile, as you approach yet another power line, come to an unsigned T-junction. Go left there and hike slightly downhill, parallel to the power line. In about 0.1 mile pass the signed northern end of the Adventure Trail whose other end, 0.8 miles to the south, you may have noted if you have ever hiked the High School Trail.Cross under the power line and find the sign for the beginning of the Brink Trail. It follows the edge of a steep slope with I-90 hidden behind dense vegetation down at the bottom -- out of sight but definitely not out of hearing. Soon you will come to a sign for the Ruth Kees Big Tree Trail (see footnote for Ruth Kees.) While you have the option of continuing on the Brink Trail, you might find the Big Tree Trail a more interesting prospect, and one with less intrusive traffic noise.The aptly-named Big Tree Trail offers the opportunity to see one of the largest trees still standing in the Tigers. Also, later in your hike you'll be following the Swamp Trail and, while the Swamp Trail does have a lot of ferns and moss, it actually does not have a lot of real swamp. To see real swamp, some of the best in the Tigers, you have to hike the Big Tree Trail!As you continue along the Big Tree Trail you will see a number of large trees, and soon the namesake ""Big Tree"" itself will begin to loom up ahead. But, just a few feet before you reach the tree, take the short side trail a few feet to the left for a look at some genuine swamp, with hanging moss, grotesque shrubs, and a lot of small green botanicals floating densely on the surface of the water. An alligator would not seem out of place here (there aren't any, of course.) And then there is the tree. It is impressive. Take a seat on the bench and contemplate it. A sign offers an estimate that the tree is between 200 and 400 years old. (Apparently it hasn't been cored to count tree rings.) While you are there, reflect that not so long ago trees like it were common throughout the Tigers and elsewhere in the western Cascades.Continue on, crossing under yet another power line. You'll be led directly onto the Swamp Trail. As noted, it does not offer the kind of swamp you found near the Big Tree. But a neat set of signs along the trail describe, for young hikers, the adventures of Zoe and her critter friends (in fact, Zoe might herself be a critter) and their concern about a possibly-mythical Swamp Monster. Actually, the story told by the signs reads better when coming the other way, so if your hiking party includes a very young hiker you might prefer to do this loop hike in the opposite direction.Part way along, the Swamp Trail is joined by a trail arriving from the north side, a possible connecting route for any hikers who elected to stay on the Brink Trail (consult your map if you opt for that route.)Soon, you will be back where you began your hike, on the Main Trail near the parking lot. For hikers going the other way, there is a sign here for the Swamp Trail just before the sign for the Around The Lake Trail. So it's easy to find the route either way. * Ruth Kees was a local environmental activist who passed on in 2009.

It’s also attainable as a day hike, but you’ll want to get an early start. Note that the round trip mileage given above is for a day hike from the Lake Stuart trailhead. From Lake Stuart, follow the lakeshore trail back towards Mount Stuart pass several campsites before delving into denser forest. The rough path is relatively easy to follow, though the many downed trees that cross the trail can be frustrating, and when wet, slippery and dangerous. Take your time and watch your step here when it’s raining or if the wood is wet. The trail winds in and out of the forest for two miles, dipping into a marshy meadow at the head of the valley before ultimately heading back into the forest. After about two miles of hiking, you'll make a righthand turn and start hiking uphill. It’s a no-nonsense route that climbs essentially straight up.Watch your footing the entire way up, as the trail is rooty, rocky, and sometimes so straight up that it’s more like climbing a ladder than hiking uphill. Grus, or crumbled granite, can make for slippery conditions on trail, particularly where you’re hiking on larger granite slabs. The final push to the lake is nearly vertical; a thigh burner going up and one that calls for extra caution descending. At the lake, photo opportunities abound. Granite, larches, and the water full of glacial till make for stunning photographs. There are also plenty of observation points available--look down on Horseshoe Lake and Lake Stuart, from a craggy rock outcropping, or gaze across the valley to Mount Stuart and the other rocky massifs that form the head of the valley. WTA Pro Tip: Snow lingers here for much of the year, so expect to run into some, whether on your way to the lake, or as you wander in the meadows around it. As always, be aware of Leave No Trace ethics, and tread carefully on exposed alpine meadows."

Because of its inaccessibility and a lack of maintenance, expect a brushy trail with blowdowns beyond this point.The Milk Creek trail is one of the primary trails to enter the wonders of the Glacier Peak Wilderness and offers a terrific 34.7-mile backpacking loop - Milk Creek (No. 790) to the Pacific Crest Trail (No. 2000) to the Suiattle River Trail (No. 784). Along the way it offers stunning close up views of Glacier Peak, endless wildflower meadows and ample opportunities for solitude.Start at the end of the Suiattle River Road near the Sulphur Creek Campground on the Suiattle River Trail. You will be following the northeast side of the river for 0.8 mile to the junction with the Milk Creek trail (790). Go right, crossing to the west side of the river here. The bridge is currently out, so search for a safe crossing--recent hikers have used logs over the river. The Milk Creek trail pulls away from the Suiattle, ascending through deep old growth forest for the next two miles. At 3 miles and 2400 feet of elevation, as it joins with Milk Creek, the trail opens into a meadow with nice views of Glacier Peak. This makes a nice spot for a short day hike, and campsites can be claimed near the creek. Continuing, the trail continues to ascend gradually until it nears PCT at 7.3 miles and 3900 feet of elevation. To do the loop described above, go left (east) on the PCT. Hikers will have to work hard - 36 swtichbacks are ahead - but will be amply rewarded with views. A climbers' path leads off from the trail at 11.5 miles and another trail (No. 788) leads up to Grassy Point at 13.3 miles (a sidetrip up this trail is well worth the effort for the jaw-dropping views of Glacier Peak). Another 8 miles along the PCT leaves hikers at an intersection with the Suiattle River trail (No. 784). Go left for the long descent (12.2 miles) along the Suiattle River back to the trailhead."

In a quarter mile it joins the south-bound Wonderland Trail that arrives here from Sunrise. So, in addition to encountering other day hikers, you might meet a few Wonderland Trail backpackers who are out for one or several nights.Not much sun reaches the forest floor along the first part of your trail, but a few shade-tolerant wildflowers do manage to thrive here. Look particularly for sidebells pyrola, queen's cup and coral root.The way crosses an occasional small stream and gradually becomes steeper. You will come to a rocky switchback where Fryingpan Creek rushes down a narrow cleft in the rock some fifty feet below the trail. You can take a careful look, but it's difficult to get a good photo there. Farther along, at another switchback, there is a good view down on a section of rapids along the creek.The trail continues on, still in the forest. Occasional openings on your left offer brief glimpses up to the cliffy north face of the Cowlitz Chimneys, where snow banks often remain until late summer, feeding meltwater to small cascades that drop precipitously down to become part of Fryingpan Creek.As you continue on, the forest around you changes gradually, the trees become smaller and the species different. Soon you are out on more open slopes, with small alpine firs and a lot of white rhododendron shrubs (distantly related to the rhodies you see in town) that often display their small white blooms in June. Your trail approaches Fryingpan Creek again, and soon you'll come to a crossing on a sturdy log with a flattened top. There's a railing too, although it often seems to lean over a bit too far toward the downstream side. Pause on the bridge, if you are comfortable. Get a good look at the milky, gritty glacial water, and take in the view upstream where part of the mountain is visible.Beyond the crossing, the trail parallels the creek for a while, in a section edged with shrubs and with a mix of wildflowers, particularly valerian. It can get warm here on a summer afternoon. Soon the route begins to switchback up the slope to the left. There is some shade there, so it may be cooler. The wildflowers on this north-facing slope peak later than those up in the meadow, so you may see a few species here long after those in the meadow are gone for the season. Soon, the switchbacks end and you take the final steps into the wildflower meadows at Summerland. When the snow first melts, avalanche lilies appear here, to be followed later by lupine, Indian paintbrush, white pedicularis and many others. On a warm afternoon the perfume can be very intense.Summerland offers designated camp sites and a group shelter, along the east side of the meadow. Camp sites here, as everywhere in the park, must be reserved in advance.Look beyond the flower meadows and take in the views up to Little Tahoma, and to the summit dome of Mount Rainier. Summerland is a great place just to sit and relax for a while. Then continue on the trail just a short way, surrounded by meadows and occasional small streams. You likely will see marmots here, and black bear sightings are not unusual. While you explore, please stay on the trails to help preserve the very fragile alpine vegetation.Summerland is itself a worthy hiking destination. You have come up 2,000 feet in about 4.5 miles, and it's fine to make it your goal for the day. But the trail does go on. Panhandle Gap beckons, another 1.5 miles along and 900 feet higher. If your time and energy permit, you really shouldn't miss it.Once you step out of the grassy meadows and start up onto the rocky moraine it's a passage into a different world. A world of boulders and gravel, of rushing melt water streams, and shallow tarns that may be ice-covered, or may sport snow bergs, well into the summer. There are wildflowers up here too, but they are hardy varieties that can survive rooted in narrow clefts that are buried in snow for much of the year.Goats find forage on the steep slopes, at least in summer, and your odds of seeing them near the gap are good. Sometimes, on hot afternoons, they bed down on remaining snow banks to keep cool. For the bears, Panhandle Gap offers little in the way of forage. But bears, like hikers, do travel this stony route, on their way to the other side of the mountain.The ongoing trail sometimes is edged with small stones or may be marked with cairns, some of them painted a deep orange. Until late summer, parts of the route may remain snow covered, but the footing generally is good most of the way. On the final approach to the gap there is a short section of trail that crosses a steep slope with boulders at the bottom. When snow lingers there late in the season the traverse may require some care. Look it over carefully before proceeding, particularly if it is frozen hard. Trekking poles may be advisable here. Check recent trip reports for advice on current conditions.When you finally do step out onto the top of the gap, the view toward to south is amazing. Clouds permitting, the Goat Rocks and Mount Adams dominate the southern horizon, with the summit of Oregon's Mount Hood often visible in the distance. The Wonderland Trail continues on south from the gap, crossing Ohanapecosh Park on its way to Indian Bar, and beyond.For day hikers, the gap is your turn-around point. But don't hurry. Sit a while, enjoy a bit of lunch and a sip of water, and just enjoy the views. If you haven't seen goats so far, they may well appear for you while you are at the gap. But eventually you have to descend, carefully if that steep snow traverse is still there, and find your way back to Summerland, and then on to your trailhead."

From here, you get a close-up view that few visitors to the park ever see: hanging glaciers, towering seracs, yawning crevasses, and thundering rockfall as the ridges of ash and breccia high above melt and crumble in the heat of the sun. For most hikers, this glimpse into the high alpine is reward enough; but for some, the lure of the dramatic landscape lying just beyond proves too tempting, and Camp Muir turns from a dividing line into a jumping off point for dreams of the summit. The route begins at Paradise and is typically under snow for its entire length until August. When not in snow, the first two miles travel first over paved trails and then over rocky paths through subalpine meadows. Used as a golf course in the 1930’s and then as a ski area until the 1970’s, the meadows have been under restoration for the last three decades and likely will be for the indefinite future -– a testament to the fragile ecosystem that exists at this already high altitude. In this early section, it is not uncommon to see marmots and deer, as well as the occasional ptarmigan, fox, or even bear. From the stairs behind the visitors center, follow the Skyline Trail past Glacier Vista and through a hairpin switchback. Shortly thereafter, turn left along a small creek -– a sign points to Pebble Creek and Camp Muir. At roughly two miles, pass through the Pebble Creek drainage. This rocky gully is your last source of water, short of melting snow. In the soft light of dusk or dawn, it is an enchanting spot, filled with the gentle sound of Pebble Creek spilling over the plate-like rocks. Even in late summer, the trail is snow-covered upon reaching the Muir Snowfield. It is here that the real climb begins. The snowfield undulates, at first quite steeply, over mounded snow. Mount Adams, Mount St. Helens, and Mount Hood come rapidly into view above the Tatoosh Range to the south. The terrain flattens out somewhat above 8,000 feet, but offers little relief as the air grows noticeably thinner. Camp Muir comes into view around 9,000 feet. It looks so close, yet seems to grow no closer –- the last 250 vertical feet, marked by a rocky ridge to your right, feel interminable, even for strong climbers.As you reach the respite of Camp Muir, gaze out across the Cowlitz Glacier to the towering mass of Gibraltar Rock, the steep walls of Cathedral Rock, and Little Tahoma, which seems dwarfed by the other features, despite being the third highest peak in the state. A small tent city populated by climbers headed to the summit stretches out onto the glacier. Two stone structures at either end of the saddle – one a guide hut, one a public shelter for climbers - are every bit as old as they look, having stood here for nearly a century. Camp Muir’s history stretches back even further - once known as “Cloud Camp,” it was re-named for naturalist John Muir after his ascent to the summit in 1888. During his party’s climb, he suggested it as a good spot to camp in the mistaken belief that it would provide shelter from the wind. Following his visit, Muir went on to play a major role in the campaign to establish Mount Rainier as a national park. WTA Pro Tip: The way down is often more treacherous than the way up. In good weather, the snow will have warmed to the consistency of soft ice cream. In bad weather, it can be easy to lose your way -- the natural tendency is to follow the slope of the hill to the right and onto the heavily crevassed Nisqually Glacier.

Many of them can be viewed close-up from day hikes around the mountain, but none encompasses the sheer mass of Emmons Glacier. Descending more than 2 vertical miles from the summit, Emmons Glacier has a surface area of 4.3 square miles and has gone through various stages of retreat and advance over the last century.Start your hike at the Glacier Basin Trailhead in the White River Campground on the road to Sunrise. Much of the lower section of this trail was washed away in the storms of 2006–2007. Over the following four years, WTA, the National Park Service and several partner organizations completely rebuilt the trail higher upslope to its original CCC standards, making for a comfortable hiking opportunity for all ages.The trail gently climbs through shady forest of hemlock and cedar, with occasional peeks of Rainier's summit and Little Tahoma. Pass a small, cascading waterfall as monkeyflower, cow-parsnip and shootingstar decorate the trailside. At 1 mile, a spur trail forks left to cross the Inter Fork on a railed footlog. Hold on to little ones while crossing the churning waters. Now on the Emmons Moraine, follow the trail upward for 0.5 mile to a viewpoint overlooking Emmons Glacier flowing down The Mountain.The lower portion of the glacier was covered by a rockfall from Little Tahoma in the 1960s, insulating it and slowing its retreat. The carved valley before you indicates the extent to which the glacier once reached. Near the foot of the valley, a small turquoise lake catches the glacier's runoff."

Wait until later in the hiking season though, as this area is known for its bugs.Begin hiking through a beautiful forest of second-growth hemlock. Boardwalks help keep your feet dry and add interest for younger hikers. After approximately a mile of hiking, arrive in a pretty meadow, where you'll find a signed junction for Anderson Butte. This 1.5 mile side trip is a steep hike, but well-shaded, and worth the sweat expended to achieve the summit, offering views of Mounts Baker and Shuksan. Take the side trip if you like, or continue right, though the meadow where several varieties of wildflowers bloom in August. Cross a small stream, and climb gradually up the meadow. Look behind you periodically, there is an excellent view of Mt. Baker.At the top of the meadow, enter a beautiful forest draped in moss. Descend steeply, taking note that you’ll have to climb this on the way back to your car. At least the trail is well-shaded. At 1.5 miles from the trailhead, arrive at another meadow and another junction.  The trail to the right heads half a mile downhill to lower Anderson Lake; a small lake surrounded by grassy meadows and an interesting wall of rocky gray pinnacles. Camping and a back-country privy are available here.The trail to the left continues 1.5 miles to Watson Lakes. It climbs briefly and then drops down to the lakes, crossing into the Noisy-Diobsud Wilderness along the way. The first lake is pretty and a worthwhile place to stop and have a snack. Camping is available, but it is not especially private.For a more rugged experience, continue on to Upper Watson Lake, the more dramatic of the two. The shoreline and the walls are much rockier, distant mountains come into view, and the berries are prolific. The camping is also much better–several sites are located on rock outcroppings along the lake shore. A backcountry privy is available.

The river must be forded eight times, but if amphibious adventuring is not for you, 1.5 miles of dry trail (and kid-friendly hiking) can be enjoyed year-round from the northern terminus of this hike at the Campbell Tree Grove.Because this hike involves eight river fords within a 2.5-mile stretch, consider wearing a pair of old running shoes so you can keep plodding without having to continuously stop to lace up your boots. The terrain and tread between the crossings is generally level, a little brushy in spots, but not rocky or rough. It's a great hike on a late summer's day. The river warms up nicely, assuring no red feet along the way.Start by heading 1 mile down the Lower Petes Creek Trail on a wide and gentle path, first through a grove of old cedars and hemlocks and then along an old clear-cut. With the sound of the West Fork Humptulips amplifying, the trail leaves the level ter-race, dropping steeply 300 feet to meet the West Fork Humptulips River Trail on the lush river bottom. Head left a short distance, encountering the river and your first ford. Scan the wide gravel bank looking for a shallow and gently flowing crossing.Once across, a grassy meadow graced with big maples lures you to continue. An old cedar-shingled shelter sits snuggly in the quiet grove. The trail wastes no time fording the river again. With the soothing song of the river constantly in range, head up the remote valley surrounded by rugged peaks of the Colonel Bob Wilderness to the west and Stovepipe and Moonlight Dome to the east. The trail traverses the western edge of the 6000-acre Moonlight Dome Roadless Area, one of the last large tracts of un-logged, unprotected national forest land in the rainforest valleys.

At 3.5 miles complete your last ford. Now enjoy 1.5 miles of dry-foot trekking on excellent tread. At 5 miles, reach the river once again: A bridge here was swept away by flooding in 2007. However, an old growth giant has conveniently fallen across the river, providing a temporary span. Use cau-tion and cross the river on it to the Campbell Tree Grove, one of the loveliest stands of old growth in the Olympics. Rest up and enjoy the return wade!"

The peninsula's wildest rainforest valleys are up the Queets River, and many a hiker has never ventured into this enchanting corner of Olympic National Park. The main deterrent is accessibility, both to and on the trail. The gravel 14-mile Queets River Road can often be agonizing to drive. And once you reach the trailhead, you'll find there's no bridge over the river! This keeps more than a handful of adventurers from ambling up the trail. But if you persist you're guaranteed a lonesome journey.From the trailhead kiosk look down the steep riverbank to see what lies ahead: the Sams River rushing into the Queets. Both need to be forded if you're intent on exploring this wild valley. The crossing can be intimidating, but in the drier months of August and September the rivers are usually only knee-deep. A set of old running shoes and sturdy trekking poles should help get you across safely. Do not attempt to cross early in the season or after heavy periods of rain. Remember, too, that on hot days the water will be higher on your return due to the melting snow feeding the river. If it looks unfavorable, head over to the Sams River Trail instead.Once you've crossed the wide river, you'll get to experience a wilderness Olympic valley the way it should be experienced-crowds in absentia. Giant firs, towering spruce, and humongous hemlocks 200-plus feet tall and several hundred years old humble your stature and status. Moss-draped maples and lichen-blotched alders line the trail. Boughs of ferns 4 feet tall crowd the understory.Although the Queets is in essence a wilderness, it has experienced man's presence for centuries. Native Americans long hunted this remote valley. A few hardy pioneers homesteaded it. At 1.6 miles a dilapidated barn is evidence of the latter's tenure.From this small clearing, Kloochman Rock can also be seen peeking above the remote valley. At 2.3 miles a short side trail leads left 0.25 mile to one of the biggest and oldest Douglas-firs in the world. With a trunk 14 feet around, this tree began its life sometime around the first millennium.Through lush bottomlands the Queets River Trail heads deeper into the heart of the Olympic Mountains. At 4 miles a side trail leads right (requiring a ford) 2 miles to Smith Place, the remains of an old hunting cabin.The main trail continues left, arriving at Spruce Bottom Camp at 5 miles. The bottomlands and gravel bars here make a nice destination for day hikers.

It's just that it really doesn't go anywhere-no peak, no lake. And in today's goal-oriented society, these types of trails are overlooked. But if it's miles of solitude you're seeking, and peace of mind that only wilderness can instill, this is your trail.The trail starts from an overlook above the Sol Duc. The North Fork is nowhere to be found. It's hidden behind a small ridge, the only real climb you'll be doing on this hike. Start by heading up that obstacle through a forest of hemlock interspersed with a few big Doug-firs. Leave the roar of the Sol Duc behind, soon supplanted by the songs of thrushes and wrens. After a climb of about 350 feet start descending, losing all elevation gained. At 1 mile behold the North Fork Sol Duc in all of its wild glory.If the bridge is still out and you decide to ford the river, choose a spot about 1000 feet downstream where the river fans out and the current is moderate. Once on the other side, look forward to miles of riverside roaming. At 1.25 miles cross a careening tributary. Through mossy maple glades, under towering conifers, and along basalt ledges lapped by the river, this trail is a true delight.At about 2 miles pass some large Sitka spruce trees that might make you feel like you're in one of the coastal rain forests. A few grassy openings are traversed along the way, and chances are always good for spotting big game in these clearings. At 3 miles you'll come to a riverside campsite, perfect for snacking or calling it quits if you prefer a shorter hike.If wanderlust persists, carry on. After passing a few big mossy boulders, the trail moves away from the riverbank, climbing above it on a steep slope. The river can now be heard crashing through a canyon, while you traverse a stately forest of Doug-firs. As you hike deeper into the lonely valley, numerous side creeks need to be crossed, and a few may leave your boots a tad bit wet.At 6.2 miles the trail drops back down to the river in a dark and cool ravine. You can ford it and continue, but most day hikers will be content turning around here. Recall some of your favorite spots on the hike in, they'll be your rest stops on the way out."

At this point, the creek is much narrower than before, and the creek edges are much rockier. Keep your eyes open –- there is a nice overlook of the creek. This is a fine spot for a break or to turn around.If your destination is McAllister Camp, continue on. An impressive washout at a bend in the creek is the signal that you are getting close. Pass the horse camp and look for a well signed junction, with McAllister Hiker Camp to the right. Cross the creek on a sturdy bridge, pausing to appreciate the green water rushing through the narrow canyon. Continue another half mile to the camp, where McAllister Creek joins Thunder Creek.

On particularly clear days, you may even see the peaks of the Oregon Coast Range. The primitive Starway trail was a slap dash job by its creator. The apocryphal tale is that after finding a mining claim back in the hills, the Starway trail's creator built a fast path up and over the nearest mountain in order to access it. As a result, the trail follows old road beds and the fall line of the hill in some sections, so it is one of the steepest ones you'll find in the state of Washington.

Carry a good map when you visit this area, and expect some route-finding along the way. All those obstacles to access mean you're likely to find solitude here, and the views are some of the best in the area Bring your camera, along with your map and compass.From the trailhead, you'll start by heading downhill (adding to your total uphill gain over the short mileage to the high point) to Copper Creek where a bridge spans the stream. Cross the bridge and turn upstream. One-quarter mile past the bridge, the Starway Trail leaves the old roadbed and begins climbing along another roadbed. Follow this trail up to a ridge crest above the end of the road.Here the trail vanishes, and you'll need to rely on flagging or route-finding to achieve the summit. Just before reaching the summit, the trail comes back into view, becoming a graveled path that winds around the east side of the high point (3,977 feet). After only a mile and a half of hiking, you're nearly 3,000 feet above the trailhead. If you feel like continuing on, another Past the high point, the trail drops quickly through alternating huckleberry and beargrass-full meadows and forest to a saddle, then ascends to intersect the Bluff Mountain Trail 172 just east of Silver Star Mountain. EXTENDING YOUR TRIP: From the intersection with Bluff Mountain, you can turn left and follow the ridgeline along the Bluff Mountain Trail 2.5 miles to the Bluff Mountain summit, or turn right and bag Silver Star in just another 1.05 miles."

This group of alpine destinations, named for symbols in the Greek mythos, make for a great day hike and an excellent workout. Don’t be dissuaded by older printings of the Green Trails map that list the elevation of this lake as 6600 feet, it is only 5600 feet. More recent versions of the maps include the corrected elevation, but covering 1900 feet in a mile and a half is still a steep grade, and the first 1400 feet are gained in less than a mile, between the trailhead and the wilderness boundary at 5000 feet level. Minotaur does not disappoint those willing to take on the vertical challenge. The lake is beautiful, often with a few patches of snow along the north-facing scree field that can last into September. The lake is very photogenic, with a jaw-dropping view down to Theseus. The trail starts off alternating between running up the ridge adjacent to the outlet creek from the lake and switchbacking up through second-growth dense enough to impede the proliferation of understory on the forest floor. The switchbacks soon give way and the trail returns to its “fisherman track” roots, heading pretty much straight up the hill. Two hundred feet above the wilderness boundary, the trail traverses northeast and enters a beautiful group of cascading meadows. These meadows are filled with wildflowers early in the season and huckleberries late in the season. Catch your breath here and breathe a sigh of relief; the workout part of the hike is behind you. Now relatively flat sections are mixed with short pitches the rest of the way up to the lake. Just before reaching the lake you will pass a swimming pool sized frog pond in a meadow directly below the lake. Once at the lake you have a number of choices: explore along the lake shore, or cross the outlet stream and walk up 100 feet to the edge of the ridge. This is a cliff, so keep a hand on kids and dogs. But the view is stellar -- from here you can look down directly on Theseus. One final option is to continue on for a mile to the top of Labyrinth Mountain. Look for WTA's hiking guide entry for information on the route up Labyrinth."

The trail comes to a junction with a doubletrack road leading off to the left. Stay right, walking on a trail that WTA crews rerouted out of a streambed to a much more drainage-friendly tread. Head down a shallow incline and shortly come to another fork in the trail. The right fork leads up a small spur trail, another area that WTA has improved by clearing the bridge and platform which overlook a small, pleasant waterfall. This runs highest in spring, slowing down to a trickle in the summer months.This trail is an excellent diversion for families camping with young children, or a leg-stretcher for I-5 travelers, but other trails meander all around the park. If you're interested in extending your stay, head back down the spur trail to the second fork you encountered. Rather than retracing your steps, continue straight on a trail that follows the wide, slow-moving East Fork Lewis River for nearly half a mile. It is possible to take this trail all the way to the picnic area (about three-quarters of a mile down the road from where your car is parked at the camping area), but the trail can be underwater in times of high tide or flood, and it is very slippery and muddy in places. It's probably best to save this one for the height of summer or when you're prepared for some scrambling. To explore the picnic area, head back to your car and take the road that heads downhill. Find yourself in a small parking area directly below I-5. There is a swimming hole here (complete with a rope swing) and a frisbee golf course, along with a couple of picnic tables and parking for about seven or eight cars."

Now hikers can enjoy peace and quiet on this gently graded trail just out of North Bend.Crossing the Middle Fork Snoqualmie River on a bridge constructed by volunteers and the Forest Service, hikers are safely delivered to the other side of the Middle Fork Snoqualmie River. Before the early nineties, access to this side of the river required a ford that was dangerous even in low water.Once across the bridge, hikers can turn right for the Pratt River Trail accessed via a connector trail built with the help of WTA volunteer crews. But a left turn to head upstream leads them deep into the quiet forest. The silence is broken only by the murmuring river, the whispering of wind through the trees, or birdsong from the fish-eating birds that live in the area. The trail weaves in and out of the forest, passing under overhanging cliffs and offering views across the river of jagged Garfield Mountain. Continue under a craggy wall dubbed Stegosaurus Butte at 0.75 miles. Soon after the Butte the trail widens, thanks to an old railroad path. This is your only hint of the area's history of logging - the railway was used to pull logs out after timber harvests. Continue on, crossing many creek drainages that keep the trail wet much of the year. The trail stays close to the river, at points even threatening to slump into the water due to repeated flooding that erodes the banks of the river. At a little more than three miles, the trail has completely washed away and is awaiting repairs to reroute the trail onto more stable ground. At this point, the trail is impassable to stock, but hikers can follow a rough, temporary path to rejoin the official trail and head into the forest.The Mountains to Sound Greenway Trust has been working with the Snoqualmie Ranger District and WTA on a plan to rebuild this section of trail on safer ground.

Taking the shortcut shaves off nearly a mile of trail, but hikers who elect to take this route miss out on intimate views of Reflection Lake. Take the right fork to stay on the Lakes Trail, and drop down 200 feet over about half a mile, meeting up with the Wonderland Trail and then the Stevens Canyon Road.

This hike is very challenging, with sparse camps, little water and some sketchy sections of loose pumice. Since the eruption denuded the slopes of the mountain, you’re almost always in sun, so make sure you wear your hat and bring sunscreen. It is all too easy to get a severe sunburn on these slopes.With those cautions in mind, you’ll fully appreciate the stark, otherworldly beauty of the blast zone. Vast fields of pumice gouged with deep gullies frame the gaping immensity of the mountain.  There are multiple points where you can access the Loowit, here are four of the most commonly used access points. (If you want a taste of the Loowit without the full meal deal, each of these hikes is a great way to sample the mountain.)Windy RidgeFollow the Truman Trail (#207) for approx. 3 miles, then take the Windy Trail (#216E) for another 1 mile to the Loowit (#216). This route will take you closest to “The Breach” and Loowit Falls. Note that camping is not allowed in the blast zone which includes the northern portion of the mountain between the South Fork of the Toutle River and Windy Pass.Ape Canyon TrailheadPark at the Ape Canyon Trailhead and go 5.5 miles on the Ape Canyon Trail (#234) to the junction with the Loowit (#216). Turn right (north) and hike another mile or two across the spectacular Plains of Abraham. Note this route is very popular with mountain bikers.Climber’s BivouacTake the Ptarmigan Trail (#216A) 2 miles to the junction with the Loowit (#216). Turn left or right to experience the Loowit as it skirts the treeline along the volcano’s southern flank.Blue Lake TrailheadFollow the Toutle Trail (#238) for about 3 miles. Ascend the Sheep Canyon Trail (#240) 2.5 miles to the Loowit. You can make a nice lollipop loop by following the Loowit another 2.5 miles north to its intersection with the terminus of the Toutle Trail, then following the Toutle Trail approx 5 miles back to the Blue Lake Trailhead. Circumnavigating Mount St. HelensSome recommend starting from the south at Climber’s Bivouac while others chose to start on the NE side from Windy Ridge. In either case you need to plan on crossing the blast zone in one push as camping is prohibited between the South Fork of the Toutle River and Windy Pass.  Since the most rugged section is on the west side where major washouts require extensive detours and/or scrambles, plan your trip to hit those sections when you are relatively fresh.Although each year hikers do complete the Loowit, others have turned back unable to find safe passage through some of the gullies. Since conditions change so frequently and people’s route finding ability and tolerance for risk vary, it is impossible to predict if the circumnavigation is “doable” at any given time for any hiker.This route description is for a counter-clockwise circumnavigation hike starting from the north side where the Windy Trail (#216E) meets the Loowit. Your first seven miles will afford near constant views of denuded slopes as you cross the blast zone looking into “The Breach”.  A short side-trail to Loowit Falls is a worthwhile break.  As you come around the mountain to the NW, the route drops into the valley carved by the South Fork of the Toutle.  Here the trail is frequently obliterated by the river and sliding loose rock and pumice. Crossing this gully is the first of three major wash-outs on the route.Continuing on the Loowit, the trail climbs up into remnant old growth forest on Crescent Ridge, and then enters a zone of burned trees and flower-rife meadows. You’ll enter subalpine forest, the trail climbing and falling until it again ascends to timberline near 4,700 ft.  About a ½ mile beyond the junction with the Sheep Canyon Trail the Loowit was obliterated by a washout in the Blue Lake Wash, leaving a huge chasm with near vertical walls in its place. The Forest Service completed a bypass route that adds another few miles, but it is much safer than attempting to scramble through the massive gully.Next, you’ll reach the junction with the Butte Camp Trail #238A. You can drop steeply along this trail—roughly 800 feet—to Butte Camp, if you need to make camp.Most of the trail from here on in is rugged as it runs through several lava beds, sometimes with nothing but posts or cairns to show the way.  After crossing Swift Creek (the winter climbing route), there is one more lava bed crossing to the junction with the June Lake Trail. For a pleasant campsite, follow the steep June Lake Trail (#216B) ¼ mile to its namesake lake. Continuing around the SE side of the Mountain you will encounter the 3rd major washout on the Loowit at Muddy Creek. It is approx. 4 miles from the June Lake Trail junction. Like the previous two washed out sections, the steep canyon walls and loose rock make it difficult and dangerous to scramble through the chasm.  WTA volunteer Backcountry Response Teams restored a badly washed-out section here in 2010.You’ll traverse more lava on the 4.75 miles to the Ape Canyon Trail.  Some of the best wild flowers are at the top of the canyon north of Pumice Butte. You finally have 4 miles of relatively smooth trail across the Plains of Abraham, then up Windy Pass and back to the intersection of the Windy Trail (#216). From there you’re on familiar terrain following the Truman Trail (#207) back to Windy Ridge.NOTE:  Trip mileage does not include required approach trails to the loop.  Some guide books give total vertical around 4000 ft, but with Blue Lake Wash detour and careful measurement, all the ups and downs make it more like 6000+ feet including whatever approach you choose."

Allow plenty of time to explore Horseshoe Basin by camping at the trailhead, where primitive camping without a water source is available. Bring plenty of water with you. From the trailhead, enter a forest still bearing scars from the 2006 Tripod Fire. Note how the trees are starting to silver and keep your eyes out wildlife, including porcupines and woodpeckers. Water is scarce along this section of trail and in the heat of summer this area can be a scorcher due to the lack of tree cover. At 1.5 miles cross a tributary of Clutch Creek, the only consistent water source until Horseshoe Basin. This is your last chance to refill water bottles, so take the time to do so here. Continue on until the trail finally breaks out of the burned area about three miles from the trailhead. Here, emerald green hillsides take over the vista in front of you, and scenic Sunny Pass beckons.Hike steadily uphill and reach the inviting pass at 4.8 miles. Sunny Pass is the perfect place for a picnic lunch. As you enjoy a snack, enjoy your first sight of Horseshoe Basin, an area that begs further exploration. On your way to the basin, you’ll see increasing amounts of subalpine fir trees, trickling creeks and bright wildflowers. At six miles you arrive at your destination; sublime Horseshoe Basin. Take in the expansiveness of the area. Gawking is allowed, even encouraged. If you’re still feeling sprightly, head uphill as far as you’d  like for increasingly expansive vistas – go far enough and you can touch Canada!WTA Pro Tip: Before you head into the vast wilderness, fill up at Whistler's Family Restaurant in Tonasket."

The trail crosses several small waterfalls and dips in and out of shady pine glades, offering a respite from the heat of the sun. The grade increases around mile three, launching into switchbacks at Hannegan Pass camp, which continue all the way up to Hannegan Pass. Enjoy the view, drink some water and have a snack at the pass, looking up the Middle Creek drainage and into the North Cascades National Park, because you're not finished yet! The trail up to Hannegan Peak begins with steadily graded switchbacks that weave through forest and beautiful alpine meadows with views of Ruth Mountain that improve as you climb.

At the summit, enjoy 360 degree views of Cascade peaks, including Goat Mountain, the High Divide, and the Nooksack Ridge to the west. To the north are the peaks of British Columbia and the remote Silesia Creek valley, and to the east, Copper Ridge is visible, as well as Mount Redoubt in the distance.

You can look out over vast hillsides that used to be covered in thick, green forest; in a matter of minutes in 1980, they were reduced to stark gray wastelands. Vegetation has only begun to come back in the last few years, and the new greenery is especially vivid against the sterile ash backdrop. Even the ridge along which the trail runs was scarred by the blast, and streaks of ash are evident everywhere.The trail takes off and immediately climbs steeply from the trailhead near Ryan Lake for about 2 miles (a 1500-foot elevation gain) to the long ridge of Goat Mountain and then heads west along its southern flank. The remnants of Mount St. Helens are put in proper context when you turn north from the summit of Goat Mountain and view noble, towering Mount Rainier. The low, gray hulk of St. Helens used to be white-capped and, some say, even more majestic in appearance than Rainier, the King of the Cascades.

The challenging climb into the Necklace Valley well-rewards hearty hikers with cool alpine lakes named for precious gems that you can swim, fish in, or just camp beside. The trail begins gently along the East Fork Foss River, traversing through a beautiful, naturally-regenerated forest that was logged by the railroads in the 1930s. The first five miles gain only 600 feet. Lowland forest wildflowers will keep your senses busy - look for trillium, calypso orchids, and yellow violets and more. This pleasant stroll abruptly ends when you come to the crossing of the East Fork Foss River. There is an established campsite here, and this is a good turn-around for a day hike of the East Fork Foss.Depending on the condition of the footlog and the amount of snowmelt in the river below, the crossing can be a little scary. Hold on to the handwire.  After the crossing, the hike changes considerably as it becomes a steep, grueling climb, gaining 2400 feet in just 3 miles until you reach the first of the gems - Jade Lake. It's nice and peaceful, and there are established campsites here, but you will be amply rewarded if you push on to Emerald or Locket Lake. Be prepared for insects.Enjoy a few days exploring up here, scrambling over granite, breathing in the fragrant mountain heather, and relaxing in the shade of forest. No campfires are allowed, so be sure and pack your backcountry stove.From the cabin, a trail climbs, then drops west to Al Lake. There is a maze of social trails in this area.The upper end of this hanging valley accesses La Bohn Lakes and the standard route on Mt. Hinman. This is most pleasant as a snow ascent in early season, but the snow chute to the gap requires an ice axe. Once the snow is gone, Hinman is very rocky.  In late season, follow the left edge of the talus as high as possible, then work left on a discernible scramble track that generally follows the right side of the La Bohn Lakes' outfall.Necklace Valley also accesses the Tank/Foehn Lakes areas. Ascend the very rocky, cairned medial moraine up this huge, recently glaciated cirque. Might be easiest in early season on snow. Please treat the fragile high country very carefully.For an adventurous hike one may continue from Tank Lakes in a generally south-westerly direction towards Iron Cap Mountain. Fred Beckey shows this route as the Alpine Lakes High Route (see Cascade Alpine Guide, #1, second edition, page 188). One may circumvent ICM to the north or go over it (both routes have their pros and cons and neither are simple). At ones discretion, descend to either Otter Lake or Big Heart Lake on fisherman's trails. From either one may gain the West Fork of the Foss River. This trail will join Road #68 just one mile south of where your car is parked at the east fork trailhead! Note that your mileage will increase to 22-26 miles with ~6500 in elevation gain."

At Big Timber Camp the river swings by, allowing the two of you to become better acquainted.This is a delightful hike on gentle terrain-perfect for introducing neophytes to the splendors of the Olympic backcountry or as an early season warm-up.

At 2.4 miles reach a bridge that spans a deep slot canyon; the West Fork thunders below. Now high above the west bank of the West Fork, the trail ascends slopes of stilted conifers and lush rhodies. After reaching a bench (elev. 2400 ft) several hundred feet above the river, the trail slowly descends to Big Timber Camp, set amid big boulders and, yes, big timber, sort of.

Once there, they either rest and play for the day, or continue on to Bear and Deer Lakes, a pair of very pretty smaller lakes deeper in the Alpine Lakes Wilderness. The very ambitious press on to remote Snoqualmie Lake. Lake Dorothy can be crowded on summer weekends, but the other lakes see fewer visitors. Sign in at the trailhead and begin your hike. You'll find the trail to Lake Dorothy generally in good condition, with many sections stabilized by carefully-assembled log cribs. It's about 1.9 miles to the lake, with an 800 foot elevation gain. After the first mile, come to a crossing of Camp Robber Creek. Pause there on the sturdy bridge to appreciate the whitewater rapids, and to enjoy the welcome (in summer) breeze that often blows down the canyon. Then continue on up the trail, encountering additional log cribs. When you reach the outlet of Lake Dorothy, a sign offers the choices of ""Outlet Spur"" straight ahead, or ""Inlet"" and ""Bear Lake"" to the left.Whatever your plans are for the day, begin with the Outlet Spur. In about 100 yards it passes a log jam at the outlet of the lake. Some of the logs are quite large and have been firmly in place for many years. Look carefully and if you feel comfortable, walk carefully a few feet out onto the logs, as many others have done before you. The reward is the best view of Lake Dorothy you will find, looking up the entire 1.5 mile length of the lake with a view of Big Snow Mountain beyond. It's a great photo op, particularly if you arrive early in the morning while the sun still is fairly low in the eastern sky.Then check the creek downstream of the log jam. The outflow is initially very tranquil, and sometimes a dipper bird may be seen foraging in the shallow water.If you plan to go on to Bear Lake, or are seeking a campsite, or are just exploring farther along Lake Dorothy, return to the trail junction. In summer, there is often a posting showing the locations of many camp sites (and a few backcountry toilets) along the eastern and southern shores of the lake. Take the trail toward the Inlet and Bear Lake, but don't expect it to be a lakeshore stroll, for much of the way the route is well above lake level. Occasional paths descend to reach campsites on benches above the lake or sites down at the lakeshore. The route alternates between forested and rocky stretches, and there is some up and down.If you are hiking in August, be alert as you pass bushes along the trail. You are likely to find ripe blueberries edging the trail.After hiking 1.8 miles from the outlet, come to Lake Dorothy's inlet stream. There is no bridge, but in summer the stream can generally be crossed on boulders, though trekking poles may be helpful for balance.Near the southern end of Lake Dorothy, an occasional tall, dead tree offers a perch for ospreys that forage there for fish. Eagles may be seen too.If your plans are for Bear Lake, get ready for some uphill. You'll gain 700 feet in 1.6 miles, on sometimes rough trail to reach the pass to Bear Lake. But the way is eased by occasional enjoyable views down to Lake Dorothy.A short way beyond the pass Bear Lake can be seen glinting through the trees. But the trail takes its time getting you there. It's a half-mile with a drop of 200 feet to get down to the western shore of the lake. This is a nice place to sit a while, relax and have a snack. It's over 5.5 miles from the trailhead, so Bear Lake is the turn-around point for many day-hikers.Deer Lake, a twin of Bear Lake, is not far away. It's only 30 feet lower than Bear Lake, and going there adds less than a mile to your round trip. At one point along the ongoing trail, bits of both lakes will be visible through the trees, so you can check out Deer Lake without going all the way there.If you are backpacking, there are possible campsites along the western shores of Bear Lake and Deer Lake. Also, a path leaving the main trail between the two lakes heads toward a bench between them, and you could investigate that area for additional camping opportunities. Extending Your HikeThe trail continues on beyond Deer Lake toward Snoqualmie Lake, itself a large, beautiful and isolated lake in a forested setting. It's just over a mile from Deer Lake, but there is a downside - literally. Snoqualmie Lake is less than 100 feet higher than Lake Dorothy, and to visit it you have to descend about 500 feet, elevation you'll have to regain on your return. So check your time and assess your energy. If it seems feasible and your interest is high, go for it.A short way beyond Deer Lake, cross a low ridge and soon you will see part of Snoqualmie Lake down below. The view is deceptive. The lake looks very close, but it will take longer than you imagine to work your way down the steep switchbacks and around to the north end, where the trail finally reaches lake level.But, once you are there, enjoy the sandy beach and the great lunch rock that offers a commanding view down the lake. It's a place to relax, and to reflect that you are over seven miles from your trailhead. There is an optional southern approach to Snoqualmie Lake along the Taylor River, but that's an even more imposing hike of 8.3 miles.If you are a backpacker, you can find a few campsites along the north end of Snoqualmie Lake. If you are visiting on a weekday you might have the lake all to yourself."

From here you can enjoy views of Spratt Mountain to the north, Jack Mountain to the south, Ross Lake and the peaks across it to the west, and behind you, peer into the sprawling Pasayten wilderness. Many hikers recommend camping here, if you can find a spot where you'll make minimal impact; sunrises are as good as sunsets from this peak. After the Dome, you'll begin a gradual descent to Ross Lake, where a cool swim in its waters will be excellent refreshment after several days of backpacking. If you started from Canyon Creek, you still have several miles of backpacking along the creek and back up-valley to your car, but since you're bordering Ross Lake with its singularly beautiful waters, it's hardly a boring stretch."

Hundreds of volunteers helped plant native grasses, trees, and shrubs, clearing out invasive species such as Scotch broom and blackberry vines. They toted tons of topsoil and cleared human relics.

The 17-mile thru-hike on the Chelan Lakeshore Trail might be just the thing for you. The adventure begins by boarding the Lady of the Lake ferry, either in Chelan or from Field’s Point. This ferry is the main way that most folks reach the small town of Stehekin, which is your destination on this trail. There are no roads leading to this tiny mountain hamlet, so your options are to hike, boat or fly in. The Lakeshore Trail is one of the most scenic ways to get there, if you’ve got a tent and a couple of days to spend taking in the sights along the nation’s third-deepest lake. When you buy tickets for the ferry, be sure to let the crew know that you need to be dropped off at Prince Creek, a stop along the east edge of the lake where backpackers and campers disembark. There is a campground at Prince Creek, but it’s unlikely that you’ll want to camp there on day one –- the ferry will drop you off in the late morning, giving you plenty of time to get a good start hiking. From Prince Creek, head up the trail and in less than a quarter-mile reach a junction with the Prince Creek Trail, switchbacking uphill to your right. Lucky for you, the Lakeshore Trail rolls out ahead of you, on a much more forgiving grade. Take that one. About a mile from the Prince Creek stop, cross Rattlesnake Creek, a seasonal stream. The Lakeshore Trail can be dry and hot late in the season. Bring plenty of water, and keep an eye out for rattlesnakes, who like to sun themselves on the exposed trail. Past Rattlesnake Creek, the next camp is at Cascade Creek, a more reliable water source. This section of trail skirts the edge of the lake, crossing Rex and Pioneer Creeks along the way. Look for Domke Falls across the way, the outlet of Domke Lake, another beautiful lake tucked behind the ridge on the other side of Chelan.Meadow Creek Shelter is the next established rest area, 6.4 miles from Rattlesnake Creek and 7.6 miles from your drop off at Prince Creek. The trail has moved upslope and away from the lake a bit, but its glittering waters are still visible below, and if you’re visiting in spring, you'll see arrowleaf balsamroot, lupine, and wild rose. It’s another 3.5 miles to the next large camping area: Moore Point. There, you can swim in those glittering waters after a hot day of hiking. Three miles from Meadow Creek Shelter, reach a junction in the trail. Turn left to head down to Moore Point. Like Prince Creek, Moore Point is a dropoff point for backpackers on the Lady of the Lake. If you want to do an abbreviated version of the Lakeshore Trail, consider asking to be dropped here. It makes the hike into Stehekin only seven miles long—a scenic way to get there in one day with a little exercise. It’s also the base camp for WTA’s annual volunteer vacations along the Lakeshore Trail. Since 2006, WTA crews have logged this trail out each spring, helping keep this early season trail open for the hikers who enjoy it. Once you’re done at Moore Point, head back up to the junction and turn left, continuing in a northeasterly direction for 0.4 miles to another junction. The trail to the right is the Fish Creek Trail, climbing steeply along Fish Creek and the south side of Hunt’s Bluff. Again, Lakeshore Trail hikers get the easy route, staying straight on towards Flick Creek Dock, about a mile and a half along the trail. As you approach Flick Creek, you’ll pass some cabins. These are the property of people who live in Stehekin, Manson, or Chelan. Please respect their privacy as you hike this section.Once you pass the Flick Creek Dock, you’re on the home stretch. It’s just 3.6 miles to the Golden West Visitor Center in Stehekin, and from there, plenty of other adventures await. The trail stays high above the lake for the first section past Flick Creek, then crosses a large wash in Fourmile Creek. In 2010, a heavy rainfall event blew this section of trail out and while the trail is passable now, you can still see the damage incurred by the heavy floodwaters. Take time on this last stretch to enjoy views of a craggy pinnacle across the way, soaring 8137-feet above the lake. This is Castle Rock, a popular climbing destination, and a photogenic one to boot. Get pictures from these angles now; you can see the rock from Stehekin, but not from the south or east side as you can see them on the Lakeshore Trail. Enter Stehekin just behind some seasonal housing and government buildings on the south end of town. Pass the Golden West Visitor Center (or duck inside for a little shade and to enjoy the small art gallery featuring work done by artists-in-residence and locals).Be sure to save time for a quick tour of the valley via bus or bike, and don’t forget to visit the Stehekin Pastry Company—two miles from the ferry dock.

The Middle Fork Snoqualmie Road benefited from these efforts, which constructed the CCC Road, a 13.5 mile long route that parallels (roughly) the Middle Fork Snoqualmie Road. The Lower Section can be tricky to navigate, as it borders private property, and signage here can send mixed messages. The trail itself is on DNR land, but be sure to bring an up-to-date map to verify your location as you hike. Begin by walking a mile on the Mount Si Road, which is closed to cars past the turnaround. Despite having a steep grade, it is walkable, and soon will leave the rough gravel by walking around a locked gate. From here on, your hike is on the old CCC Road. The trail takes you along a rocky ridge, high above the valley below. Stop and look around often -- there are stunning views to the south of Rattlesnake Ridge and Ledge, and to the east is Mailbox Peak. If the day is clear, the fuzzy peaks of the Upper Snoqualmie valley are evident via peek-a-boo views. 3.5 miles beyond where you parked your car, arrive at a junction where a trail joins your route on the left. Taking this trail will lead you to Green Mountain, but save that trip for another day. Take the right fork, and in about half a mile, arrive at colorfully named Brawling Creek, complete with tumultuous waterfalls.If you're looking for a short dayhike, this is a great place to stop, have lunch, snap some photos and then turn around. But if you'd like to carry on, there are still many miles of forested walking awaiting you along the road."

From Marmot Pass one can continue to either the Upper Big Quilcene or Tubal Cain Trail.The hike starts out easy and stays easy for the 3.4 miles to Camp Handy. About a mile up the trail you’ll enter the Buckhorn Wilderness when you step off the footlog bridge over Royal Creek. Here, the river often runs close to the trail.  You’ll spy a milky grey tint to its waters in still pools. This color comes from suspended glacial flour contributed by the meltwater sources of the Upper Dungeness tributaries. At about 2.6 miles you’ll cross the Dungeness on a stout bridge.Camp Handy comes into sight along the rivers edge at 3.4 miles. Its expansive riverfront meadow and cedar shingle shelter make it a popular campsite for people, which in turn has made it a popular cafeteria for gray jays and chipmunks. Take the side trip down to the meadow and enjoy the views up the valley toward Constance Pass and Inner Constance. This is where some people may elect to turn around, which gives you a 6.4 mile roundtrip hike with 600 feet of gain. But there are more views to be had further on. From Camp Handy, the trail climbs without switchbacking in the three miles to Boulder Shelter. The trail crosses two good water sources along the way. At several points, the westward vistas offer clear views into the Milk Creek and Heather Creek drainages and at numerous avalanche paths on the opposite side of the valley.  You’ll arrive at Boulder Shelter at about 6.4 miles. The shelter was standing as of this writing in 2014, but much of the nearby area is strewn with avalanche snapped trees--harsh winters can take their toll on the area and the shelter may not be standing when you visit. The creek at Boulder Shelter offers the most reliable water on the trail.Next stop is the end of the trail--Marmot Pass, 8.1 miles from the trailhead. But you’ll probably be stopping along the switchbacks above Boulder Shelter either for a rest or to take in the broad views. As the trees peter out, take a look around and enjoy the clumps of contorted white bark pine. As the trail makes its final northward ascending traverse to Marmot Pass you might encounter some steep and somewhat exposed snowfields as late as early July.

Some believe the lake was formed when a stream was dammed by lava from Blue Lake Volcano, a cinder cone west of the lake. With history and myths like this surrounding this area, it's no surprise that the trail sees heavy use. Users are dispersed as they near the lake: bikers and equestrians use the Jumpoff Trail and Bishop Ridge to loop around the lake, while hikers can continue in relative quiet on the Blue Lake Trail just past the lake.The hike is a decent challenge because it's a narrow, steep trail. The terrain is interesting, with waterfalls and its trademark basalt columns. If you like solitude, this is the trail for you.The trail ascends to the canyon of Blue Lake Creek, sometimes very steeply (stone steps in some stretches provide much-needed help), and then follows it for most of the remainder of the hike. No overwhelming views, but occasional ones down to the Cispus valley. The canyon is very pretty, rising nearly vertically on the other side of the creek from the trail, with several small waterfalls and interesting formations. About 1/4 mile before the lake is a junction with Blue Lake Ridge trail 271. (Note: motorized vehicles are permitted on 271.) Some past logging is visible from the trail shortly before the junction.

One of the most interesting trails is the Lower Lake Trail, which encircles the mysterious lake and allows access to its secrets.The trail starts at the boat launch, and you can choose to travel either direction. Either way you choose, make sure to ask the locals about the lake. Though the depth of the crater may be known to science, the locals all have differing opinions on how deep the pool really is. What they can all agree on is the existence of a beast that haunts the lake, a phantom that rarely makes itself known. Even the park rangers claim to have witnessed it surface over the years. The creature is widely accepted to be a giant sturgeon that somehow made its way into this spring-fed lake.

Snowshoers can enjoy their surroundings here as they stroll up the path, gazing in wonder at the beautiful snow-shrouded landscape. The forest is a mixed bag of old pine and fir, so it is generally open and light. Sun streaks in through the thin canopy to keep the valley bright and sunny.

The views, while not amazing, are quite picturesque. In addition to the scenic river views, you can catch occasional glimpses up the valley of Polallie Ridge on the right and Chikamin Ridge straight ahead. The valley narrows considerably after the first 0.5 mile, and at 1 mile, the trail is squeezed tight into a narrow gorge. The river quickens, and the trail climbs until, at 2 miles, it levels out and the valley opens up again. The walls stay close, but not nearly as confining as the section just passed. The last 1.5 miles of trail ramble gently and serenely to a junction with Forest Road 4616 along the banks of Cooper Lake.

You'll walk through a serene willow forest, marvel at the power of nature when you encounter twisted hulks of logging machinery, and see plenty of gnarled stumps where tall evergreens once stood.Despite several pushes for National Park status, Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument falls under the supervision of the Gifford Pinchot National Forest. The Forest Service does the best they can with limited resources, but most of the dollars are directed to the main Visitor Center at Johnston Ridge Observatory, at the end of Spirit Lake Highway (State Route 504). There, on a sunny weekend, you'll hear dozens of languages as throngs of tourists wander the interpretive exhibits and nature paths. The Visitor Center is well worth a visit if time allows following your hike. It is $8.00 per person, or free admission for one with an annual Northwest Forest Pass or America the Beautiful Pass.Back to the hiking! South Coldwater Trail 230A starts from a medium-sized parking lot off Spirit Lake Highway. Leave Fido at home—pets are not allowed on this hike. And please keep to the established trail throughout your visit. This fragile landscape will take decades to heal, and a stray bootprint in the fine ash leaves a bad impression for other visitors. If the day is warm be sure to pack extra water—you will find none on this trail. The area is frequented by herds of elk in late spring. As you ascend you'll see large poles that mark the way and serve as confidence markers to keep you off the occasional crisscrossing game trails. Climb moderately, then more steeply through a shady forest of willows to arrive at the rusting remains of a logging caterpillar, with the crater of Mount St. Helens in the background to the south. Continue up the ridge for views down to Coldwater Lake and north to the Coldwater Ridge Visitor Center—mothballed for several years, but now a learning and science center for education and conservancy groups. You'll follow old roadbed for another mile. In late summer, ripe huckleberry bushes will slow your pace. Look left shortly before the junction with Lakes Trail 230—you might miss an old bulldozer set askew from the volcanic blast. The junction is your turnaround point, but check in with your legs. If you're feeling adventuresom, press on. Another two miles down the trail to the left will take you down to a bridge over Coldwater Creek. Another steep mile down the righthand trail takes you to Ridge Camp, one of eight reservable camps in the Mount Margaret Backcountry and Coldwater Saddle, with stunning views of the ridges and valleys north of the mountain. Back at the trailhead, take a few moments to stretch and dust yourself off—you’re likely covered in volcanic ash! If time allows, stop by the Coldwater Lake picnic area to clean up and walk the Birth of a Lake Nature Trail 246, a half-mile concrete path and boardwalk that is ADA-accessible. A loop hike is possible by adding Lakes Trail 211 and fully circumnavigating Coldwater Lake. This is best done with a group and a car drop or key exchange, with cars at the South Coldwater trailhead and the Coldwater Lake boat launch. You could walk the shy mile from the boat launch to the South Coldwater trailhead, but it involves a dicey road walk along SR 504, with cars, motorcycles, tour buses and motorhomes blasting by you. Expect about 10 miles and 2,000 feet of cumulative gain. WTA Pro Tips: If you’re on this hike at the peak of summer heat, pocket some hard candy or mints to keep the saliva flowing between gulps of water. For supper, enjoy an elk burger and berry cobbler with views of the Toutle River at Patty’s Place at 19-Mile House. If you can wait, tell your tummy to hold on for Papa Pete’s Pizza in Castle Rock if your return trip is south, or McMenamins Olympic Club in old downtown Centralia if your return trip is north."

There remain a few traces of that old mule trail visible on the upper mountain-when the snowpack is light and nearly melted off, you can still see the trail pounded into the pumice of the upper mountains. This route doesn't get us to the upper mountain, though. It does, how-ever, take us into the glacier zone.

There were two search and rescue missions here in 2008.The first 2.5 miles to Saddle Lake are usually soggy and sometimes feel like hiking up a stream. The lake is pretty and hemmed in tightly with trees.The next two miles to Goat Flats start breaking out of the trees and are quite pretty. Goat Flats is a gorgeous meadow on top of a ridge. To the North are views down into a valley. There are a number of very nice campsites. Make sure you have something to keep the bears out of your food as bears are known to frequent the area.The trail to Tin Can Gap follows the South side of the ridge and is mostly above the tree line.At Tin Can Gap, the technical stuff starts. Ice axes are a must and crampons and a rope should be considered. Almost immediately, a small but quite steep snowfield must be crossed or skirted on the North side of the ridge. Late in the season you might be able to follow a small moat around to the high side for safety. If you cross the snowfield directly (the only way I have done it) I recommend chopping steps or wearing crampons. The rock on the far side can be rather thin (smooth) so be prepared to look for small hand and footholds. The trail will then cross the ridge and continue on the South face of the ridge.After a bit, the trail will cross back to the North side of the ridge and you will run into the top of the Queest-Alb glacier. This is where one of the search and rescue missions occured. Most people continue onto the glacier and descend to where the trail crosses back to the South side of the ridge. This can be extremely slippery and dangerous. If you slip a best-case scenario is to slide about 200 feet into rocks. A worst case scenario is to miss the rocks and continue down several thousand feet to the crevasses at the bottom of the glacier. Late season you can keep off of the glacier by staying in the moat between the top of the glacier and the rock. Finding the entrance to the moat can be a bit tricky in bad weather. Just before you reach the glacier there will be a sloping rock face to your right that continues along the ridge. Scramble up this easy face and you should reach a point where you can look down into the moat. At the time of this writing there was a handline tied to a small tree that you could use to get down into the moat. Past the top of the glacier, the trail traverses back to the South side of the ridge and continues until you get to a snowfield below the summit. After crossing the snowfield you scramble on the rocks until you find the ladders up to the lookout. The three ladders are pure vertical.If you have made it this far you will reach a very nice old fire lookout. It has incredible views and room for a few people to sleep. There is even some old fire spotting equipment.The scramble book recommends 11 hours round trip. If you hike fast then you can make it up in about five hours and down in four."

The trail takes you a short way through trees and huckleberry bushes, then heads uphill. You know you are on the right trail when you see a steep, rooty, eroded but obvious trail heading uphill. Note that this will be a mud fest in the rain, for sure. Climb up to the first set of meadows and enjoy some 'peak-a-boo' views of Glacier Peak through the trees. Climb a bit more, and notice a nice tarn on your left. Walk over and check the mud for tracks to see if you can figure out who lives in these woods. If the mosquitoes are thick, you may want to admire from afar. Once through this scenic meadow, climb another steep section of rocky eroded trail and come to a meadow filled with huckleberry bushes. Indeed, you may be sharing the section of the trail with other hikers, both two legged and four. Once through the huckleberries, you have reached the high point and should have some better views of Glacier Peak and more of the Central Cascades and the Skykomish Valley. Now follow more rooty eroded trail as it heads straight ahead and down to the lake. Soon you will see the lake, nestled in a bowl of rock and forest above the Deception Creek valley. The lake is reached in about a half mile from the ridgetop. Once you reach the lake, follow a brushy trail to the left. This leads to a few nice campsites along the lakeshore with a backcountry toilet. There is one very large diameter tree across the trail that blew down many years ago and is now a nice silver grey. You will need to climb over or go around it.The trail does not go around the lake, but disappears in brush by the outlet stream. Walk over to the edge of the ridge and get a few glimpses of the next ridge over. Down by the lake, look to the southeast and find Terrace Mountain. Somewhere between you and it are another couple of lakes called Ptarmigan Lakes. If you wish to explore those lakes, you will need routefinding skills.

From the get-go, the Shriner Peak Trail steadily ascends 3,424 feet in 4.25 miles. Bring lots of water--you'll need it , and there aren't many sources along the way.

Sprawling with wildflowers just weeks ago, it's now carpeted with autumn color: Vine maple, mountain ash, golden larch, and crimson huckleberries transform Mount Rainier's hillsides into deep shades of red, yellow, and orange. After another 0.75 miles of steep climbing, you're rewarded with a high view of Shriner Lake far below. From here, the finl mile to the summit turns dusty and rocky. Just 0.25 miles from the summit, catch your first view of the lookout tower standing tall on Shriner Peak.

But Schmitz Preserve Park offers exactly that! The 53.1 acre park was formed from land donated to the city between 1908 and 1912, before the area had been completely logged. The largest parcel was donated by German immigrants Ferdinand and Emma Schmitz, after whom the park is named.There is no entry fee, and official park hours are daily, 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. The park offers 1.7 miles of hiking trails. Since there are no trail signs in the park you may want to print a trail map in advance. Go to www.seattle.gov/parks/search.htm, enter ""Schmitz Preserve"" in the search window and, when you get to the park page, click on ""Hiking Trails.""As you walk the trails be alert for a few exceptionally large conifers, and reflect that trees like these once were common throughout the Puget Sound area. Early in the season you will see the yellow hoods of skunk cabbage, along with blooms of Indian plum, salmon berry, Oregon grape, bleeding heart and trillium. You may hear the loud calls of pileated woodpeckers and flickers, and are likely to see a number of frisky squirrels. Raccoons also are present, but are mostly nocturnal. This is just a hint of the diversity of plants and animals you might see in the park. For more complete lists, check the Ecology page at the website of the Friends of Schmitz Preserve.Begin your hike at the corner of SW Admiral Way and SW Stevens St, next to a signboard. The first part of your hike is on what appears to be a narrow paved street. Many years ago cars could drive a short way into the park on ""Schmitz Boulevard,"" and that road still appears on some street maps. The route once led to a small parking lot, and to a picnic area graced with a pergola. Unfortunately, those amenities often were vandalized and they were removed in the late 1940s. Today, the street is gated and is part of the park's trail system.The trails lead generally upstream along Schmitz Preserve Creek and its small tributaries, with some routes reaching higher points on the southern, eastern or western park boundaries. If you like to explore, you can simply meander the trails with a map in hand. Or, for a more structured hike follow the suggestions here.About 700 feet from the trailhead come to a trail fork and stay left. In another 500 feet come to another trail fork and stay left again. After 350 additional feet, come to a trail crossing. You can explore the left branch if you like. It gains about 150 feet to reach the eastern boundary of the park at SW Hinds St, next to a storm water pumping station. If you elect to do this side trip, afterwards you'll need to backtrack to the trail crossing. To explore this branch, head sharply left upstream.In 600 feet or so, come to a trail junction. As of spring 2015, the ongoing route uphill is blocked by a blowdown, and if you were to scramble over that log you soon would encounter another blowdown. Beyond that point the route becomes steeper and more primitive, and there are additional blowdowns. You can explore it if you like, but fortunately there is an easier alternative!At the trail junction, when you are contemplating that very first blowdown, look off to your right. You will discover another trail heading gently uphill. It's not shown on your map but it does seem to be a well-maintained trail, likely intended as a replacement for the route that has all the obstacles. It climbs steadily through a few switchbacks and arrives at the southern park boundary at the corner of SW Orleans St and 53rd Ave SW, where you will have come up about 220 feet from your trailhead. A neighbor there has erected wood sculptures of creatures both real and mythical that gaze out whimsically on the trail.Well, it's a small park and already you have hiked from the trailhead up to the southern boundary, and perhaps taken that optional side-trip to the eastern boundary too. Now you need to return to that trail junction by the first log blowdown. There, as you are facing downhill, the trail fork to your right is the one you arrived on. So, to add some variety on your return, take the left fork now.In about 1,000 feet pass a trail junction and continue on down the canyon. In another 200 feet or so you may notice a good trail heading gently uphill to your left. If you were to explore that route it would climb about 75 feet and take you to the west park boundary at Hanford St. But, perversely, you would find a sign there, facing the street, announcing that the trail is closed and that you should not enter! Of course that's not mentioned at the lower end of the trail.Back on the main trail, a few feet downstream from the route that leads up to Hanford St, come to another trail junction. The right fork crosses the creek on a rustic set of stones and rejoins the trail you hiked in on, and that will take you back to your trailhead.If, instead, you were to take the left trail fork it would follow along the creek, pass under the SW Admiral Way Bridge with its profusion of colorful graffiti art, then continue on to reach the Alki Playfield. You can take that side trip if you like although it's less scenic than the rest of the park. If you do, then you'll need to return to the creek crossing to find the route that takes you back to your trailhead.On the routes mentioned above you will be hiking mostly east of the creek on your hike in, and mostly west of the creek on your return. The map indicates a number of other short trails between these two routes, and they are worth exploring. The entire park includes only 1.7 miles of trails, so you can easily hike them all in a morning or an afternoon."

Lake Ethel is one of the ‘Scottish Lakes’, which includes nearby Lake Donald, Loch Eileen and Lake Julius. The lakes were given names by Albert Hale Sylvester, who was a topographer for USGS working throughout the Washington Cascades around 1900. Lake Ethel was named by him after the wife of Forest Service ranger Frank Lenzie. The other lakes in the area have also been named after female family and friends of Sylvester.The entire Scottish Lakes area is great for solitude. Due to its location east of the Stevens Pass, the forest is not as lush, and the Chiwaukum mountains are not as rough as nearby areas, such as the Enchantments. This keeps the crowds away, which results in a great backcountry experience. Another advantage of the area is that some of the Chiwaukum peaks are accessible for normal hikers, who only have to bring enough stamina. From Lake Ethel there are numerous options to extend your trip for backpacking or long day hikes. Lake Ethel trail is the entry-point into the beautiful Scottish Lake area, unless you use the services of the Scottish Lakes High Camp (see Extending Your Trip below).The trail starts from the Gill Creek Road, named after the Gill Creek that has Lake Ethel as its source. The Gill Creek Road crosses the railroad in a spot where trains are regularly waiting for other trains from the opposite direction to come down from Stevens Pass, so expect that you might have to wait for a bit for the train to depart.From the trailhead at 2400 feet, waste no time in ascending through the steep forest with many switchbacks for about 1.2 mile until 3800 feet. In spite of the gain, the way is very well-graded. Now and then, the forest opens up for nice views of the Nason Ridge on the other side of the valley. A couple of switchbacks are close to the Gill Creek, which has a nice volume of water early summer. From this point there is no water source close to the trail until Lake Ethel.At 3800 feet, the trail enters a big clear-cut area (this area is private land that is logged). While it is odd to see every single tree eradicated in this area, it does have some benefits. The trail climbs over the next 1.5 mile to 5000 feet and you enjoy expansive views of Mount Mastiff, Nason Ridge and eventually Glacier Peak. Early in summer, the wildflowers are beautiful in this open terrain. This section is also good for seeing wildlife like grouse and deer. While climbing through the clear-cut area you will cross four logging roads. The clear-cut is fairly exposed to wind coming through Stevens Pass, so it can be chilly if windy.After re-entering the forest, the trail climbs over 1 mile to 5700 feet, and then descends 200 feet into the valley where Gill Creek and Lake Ethel lie. At the bottom of the descent, join an extremely brushy abandoned trail that starts from one of the logging roads. On the road back, pay close attention and be sure to take the same route back. Shortly after the intersection, you enter the Alpine Lakes Wilderness, followed by an intersection with the Upper Roaring Creek Trail to the right. Continue straight for about 0.2 mile to Lake Ethel. There are nice camping places available close to the lake, which is surrounded by beautiful steep rocks and waterfalls originating from snowfields higher up, cascading down into the lake.Extending your Trip: From Lake Ethel, you can continue your trip on the Upper Roaring Creek trail to Lake Julius. With a high point of 6050 feet, this beautiful trail has a more alpine feel, featuring expansive views of peaks towards the north and east, including Glacier Peak, Clark Mountain, and the Chiwawa Mountains. From Lake Ethel to Lake Julius is 2.7 miles one-way. From Lake Julius you can continue to Loch Eileen, just 0.5 miles one-way, or the bootpath to Lake Donald, which is more steep, another 0.5 miles one-way. Bagging all of these completes the collection of Scottish Lakes. Beyond Lake Donald are the High Meadows, a beautiful high alpine area with extensive wildflowers, beautiful tarns, and snow late into summer. From the High Meadows, experienced hikers can also climb the North Chiwaukum (Point 7132), the more difficult Middle Chiwaukum (Point 7423), and Point 6935 on McCue Ridge. About 2.5 miles from Lake Julius is Scottish Lakes High Camp, a remote retreat where you can rent cabins to enjoy this area for a longer period of time, including winter."

The first two miles steadily climbs through the forest switchbacking periodically. Turning right at the first junction 1.8 miles into your hike will get you to Squaw Lake in short order. There are several campsites here that are perfect for lunch or family camping.For the next two miles, your trail continues to climb slowly up the ridge line towards Cathedral Pass and the junction with the Pacific Crest Trail. Rock outcrops on the right give views of the Wenatchee mountains to the east and Tucquala Meadows below. Cathedral Rock occasionally pokes its andesitic head above the trees straight ahead, beckoning you to move along. Consider, as you gawk at this sheer, rocky monolith that it was first climbed in the 1890s! At 5600 feet, join the Pacific Crest Trail briefly. Turn south towards Mexico (don't worry, you're not going all the way there). In 0.2 miles the ridge crest is reached. Campsites exist along the ridge here south of the pass. The well-groomed, wide and easy nature of the trail to this point may now be entirely forgotten. At the first switchback down towards Deep Lake the spur trail to Peggy's departs. The sign noting, ""Not Suitable for Stock"" is an understatement to say the least. The trail is heavily used, which means that it is at least fairly easy to follow. It is however steep and quite narrow in spots. If you explore the slopes above Peggy's on the opposite side of this valley, look for this trail as it skirts the bottom edge of the talus slope of Cathedral. It is quite impressive. This mile long stretch of trail has sheer drop offs, loose rock, and user-built-no-switchback stretches which may test your nerves and abilities. Just when you've uttered your umpteenth curse of the loose and steep terrain you reach the top and voila--there is Peggy's! There are several larger campsites directly around the lake. There are also several sites and trails which have been clearly marked for restoration by the forest service, please be considerate. More distant sites are equally beautiful and have the benefit of increased privacy. The forest service privy is located a quarter-mile beyond Peggy’s Pond.For those with time and a need to explore there are days worth of rambling from these camps. Hyas Creek glacier is on the eastern aspect of Mount Daniel and to the west of Peggy’s. This delicate alpine landscape is home to cascading waterfalls, glacial pools with their flour-like silt, monkey flowers and dozens of other wildflowers in profusion across the stark white rocks, and braided rivers rewriting the landscape as though a child were playing in this great cirque.Dried up lake bottoms are evident where meanders once took water, perhaps they will fill again in decades to come. If you venture here, please do not build wind blocks or fire rings, and be conscientious of where you step; sticking to solid rock is best.Climbs of Cathedral Rock and Mount Daniel should be left to experienced mountaineers as both are significant undertakings. The southeast shoulder of Daniels, which ascends directly from the west side of Peggy’s Pond, is a fun ridge line romp for the energetic ones in your group. For those with an interest, there is a cabin remnant to visit southwest of Peggy's. Head southwest from Peggy’s towards smaller ponds noted on maps. At the outlet of these ponds continue SSE, in ~.25 mile this trail will rejoin the Peggy's Pond trail. A large cabin's foundation overlooks Deep Lake along this stretch."

As on most hikes which span such elevation changes, you'll enjoy seeing different wildflowers as you gain elevation. Balsamroot bobs at the trailhead, and hikers pass through Ponderosa pines, lupine, and then purple penstemon, even Tweedy's Lewisia as you leave the forest and traverse through rockier terrain. Just a quarter-mile into the trail, as you enjoy the balsamroot, cross Fourth of July creek, and get ready for another crossing in a little more than another quarter-mile. From here, the grade increases significantly and does not relent until you arrive at the lookout. There is one water source about 2.5 miles into the hike, but if you have the means, there will be snow to melt at the summit. Fortunately, the flowers provide a welcome distraction from the switchbacks as you climb.  Arrive at an old burn about 3.6 miles in, where the mountain laurel lies thick against the path and Jacob's Ladder blankets the floor. Pause here and catch your breath and enjoy views all the way to Cashmere before continuing your climb into an expansive alpine garden with glacier lilies, spring beauties, and other tough little alpine flowers sprouting from the ground at your feet.Four miles from the trailhead is a great spot to stop, rest and refuel before your last 1000 feet of elevation gain.

Views across the valley improve with every switchback you mount, and before reaching Lower Lyman, you will see a truly magnificent waterfall.Lower Lyman Lake has three campsites and a flat rock slab to contemplate the lake and view the outlet from the upper lakes. Camping here is a good option, since by now you have gone a little over nine miles, and the next campsite is on the other side of Cloudy Pass.Views from the pass are spectacular -- if you miss the clouds that the pass is named for -- and on both sides of the trail green meadows lift your gaze upward.

Once over Cloudy Pass, you have a little over 20 miles into High Bridge, all following the PCT north. Watch your footing on the descent from Cloudy Pass - the trail is muddy and steep, and even the check steps installed can't make it completely safe. Continue on the trail, passing small campsites, brushy and marshy areas, all the while listening to the soundtrack of the Suiattle and various birds and animals accompanying you. Hemlock Camp is a stock camp that offers abundant sites, but beware! There is the danger of falling trees, and occasionally the camp is closed. Further on are Cedar and Swamp Creek camps. Contrary to what you might think, Swamp Creek is the more preferable of these two camps. Further on the trail stop at 5-mile Camp for a snack, before finishing your last 5 miles to High Bridge, along Agnes Creek, before catching the bus into Stehekin. Don't miss this, because it's another 14 miles along the road to get into town. Check the bus schedule to plan your timing: http://www.lodgeatstehekin.com/shuttle-schedule.pdf**Note from WTA: Because of the mine remediation in Holden, transportation from the ferry to the village only operates Saturdays and Sundays. The village is also not accepting guests during the summer months, because of the remediation, so plan to hike to the closest campsite on the first day of your trip.**"

Miles of wildflowers along Meander Meadow and Cady Ridge will delight the hiker who passes through during July and August. Fantastic views of the Cascades, Glacier Peak and hanging valleys add to the allure, and it's all packaged up in a 16-mile loop.Start on the Little Wenatchee River Trail and ascend this picturesque river valley at a leisurely pace. This section of trail is described in full under the Hiking Guide entry entitled Meander Meadow. It is characterized by old growth forest and avalanche slopes. After climbing slowly for the first four miles, the trail gets down to business and climbs about 1400 in two miles before entering the wildflower heaven that is Meander Meadow.This is the headwaters to the Little Wenatchee River. The meadow goes on for some time before hooking up with the PCT. Check out the view of Glacier Peak from here! At this point, you might wish you'd have planned for an extra day of exploring. Kodiak Peak and White Pass beckon to the north, Blue Lake and June Mountain are just a short distance to the west, and Lake Sally Ann and a longer loop via Cady Pass back to the trailhead are to the south.For this loop, head left on the PCT to Sauk Pass and Dishpan Gap. Then follow the trail to its junction with the Cady Ridge Trail (1532). Who knew that the way back to civilization could be so fantastic? Cady Ridge is in a class all by itself - a mile-high ridge dominated by the blue and purple hues of lupine, jaw-dropping views of dozens of peaks, and the snowy dominance of Glacier Peak. After enjoying your ridge walk, the trail begins to descend - and as you near the end of your hike, it gets downright steep! Watch the knees here. With just a half-mile left to the trailhead, the Cady Ridge trail meets up with the Cady Creek trail (1501). Go left at this junction and return to where you started."

This is a pleasant hike early or late season, crowds are nil, and chances are always good of spotting bears or other large woodland critters. Indian Creek is one of the best hikes in the vicinity for admiring ancient forest or when you want the wilderness all to yourself.Take the trail left and cross the White River on a sturdy bridge. Admire rays of sunlight dancing on the mist that rises from the cascades crashing through the tight chasm below. Immediately enter the Glacier Peak Wilderness and come to a junction. Left leads to the dizzying heights of Mount David. Head right on a near-level course through towering old growth that lines the banks of the White River.Witness some of the widest-girth western red cedar you've ever seen. Continue through cathedral groves that echo with sacred arias from the river.

About 2 miles from the trailhead, this is a good turnaround spot for children and hikers not interested in gaining elevation for the day. Otherwise continue, crossing the crashing creek on a good bridge and commencing to climb via a series of long, gentle switchbacks.At about 3 miles, after passing a pretty cascade on the boulder-strewn creek, the way levels out. Indian Creek itself also mellows, and avalanche slopes soon interrupt the forest, granting views of impressive Mount David and its scarred slopes. Continue through brushy meadows best avoided in wet weather. Thickets of willow and alder and high grasses hide the creek. At about 4 miles, after crossing a small side creek, come to a campsite nestled among big cottonwoods. This is a good spot to call it a day."

At four miles and with 4000 feet of elevation gain, the trail provides hikers with a very good workout. Along the way, you'll have lots to look at, as the elevation change can roll an entire season of wildflowers into a single hike. Rock roses and paintbrush bob near the trailhead, while avalanche lilys sway in the breeze near the summit. When you aren't looking at the wildflowers, the vistas are outstanding.The trail naturally breaks into a number of sections. The first three-quarters of a mile takes you  through a lowland forest made up of ponderosa pines and big leaf maples. Climb a moderate grade 700 feet to a small waterfall fed from springs that feed Fall Creek. This is an excellent slightly more challenging destination for kids. From the falls, there are excellent views of lake Wenatchee.In 2005, there was a fire on Dirty Face that started just west of the trailhead and burned parallel to the trail all the way to the backside of the lookout. As you hike up you can see the various stages of fire ecology at work. The fire hop-scotched up the ridge, burning intensely in spots, while leaving many areas completely untouched. Venturing through these sites is fascinating, and each trip greets hikers with new fallen trees across the trail. Be aware that in windy conditions, these burned-out giants can fall, making it a dangerous environment in high winds. After crossing the waterfall, there are a few switchbacks -- a warm up of what's to come. The trail follows a series of long abandoned logging roads. The trail tracks mostly east, and after few more switchbacks the flat mid section is reached. At this point, roughly 1.75 miles from the trailhead, the trail turns sharply back west along an old logging road.Here there is a small sign that points the way. 100 yards behind the sign is the last reliable water. Fill up and water the dog; the hike really kicks into gear in about a half a mile. At 2.25 miles the old logging road changes back to trail for a mile of short unrelenting switchbacks, followed by three-quarters of a mile of longer, (but just as steep) switchbacks. The ground is drier here, so there are fewer wildflowers, though grouse are frequently heard and occasionally spotted. Take time to catch your breath and look around; here the views really open up: east to Fish Lake and south over Nason Ridge, where the Enchantments come in to view. Gaze downwards on kite sailors and windsurfers on Lake Wenatchee.The last mile to the summit rolls around to the east of the lookout. In this area, the fire burned quite hot, and for the five years after the fire almost nothing grew in this area. Now the brush, fireweed and saplings are crowding around the remaining grey, weathered skeletons of trees.You arrive at the lookout before you know it. The views from here are spectacular. Spy Glacier Peak to the north, and to the northeast look up the Chiwawa valley, where snow hangs onto the peaks well into the season. South across Nason Ridge you can see Mt. Stuart, on clear days you can see Rainier peeking out. To the west you can see all the peaks accessible up the Little Wenatchee and the White River. The fire opened up the views from the lookout, but the lack of trees lets more sun in, so don't forget sunscreen. From July to mid-September, the trail will be hot, so start early and carry plenty of water, but have a jacket for the summit; the lookout can be cool and windy. On your return to the car, you will have more time to take in the views, and don't forget to reward yourself at the 59er Diner at Coles corner for a milkshake."

This is just far enough from the crest to leave west side clouds behind. This hike is an under-appreciated one in the Stevens Pass area, so you may be lucky enough to enjoy a relatively uncrowded hike. The lake is pretty, the mileage is modest and good switchbacks moderate the elevation gain. The trail is shaded in the summer, making it a great choice for sunny summer days, but the south face permits enough sun in the early season to melt out the lower portion of the hike, meaning it's accessible early. Older kids who have prior hiking experience under their belts will enjoy this trail, and the adventurous can add a difficult two mile extension to Lost Lake. Don’t say we didn’t warn you, see our trip reports for real time descriptions written by the few that have returned from Lost Lake.What’s not to like? This reporter really enjoys this lake, but that said, it can be a buggy destination in early summer. In May or June of normal snow years, the first one and three-quarter miles are often snow free, but in the valley below the lake, snow can linger.The trail is is easy to follow; there are old blazes on trees alongside the trail from when it was originally routed 80 years ago. While they're quite obvious in the summer, heavy snow buries them deep in the winter. Route-finding skills are required to get to Merritt Lake in these winter. The first 1.75 miles of the trail climb on a well shaded slope as the trail switchbacks up, paralleling Highway 2. If there is no wind, you will be accompanied by some highway noise for the first part of the hike.   Once you turn the corner away from the highway, you have gained 1500 feet and the grade eases. This section boasts lots of huckleberries in late summer. Road noise completely disappears, and the only sounds of civilization are the occasional train whistle from crossings far below. Just before the junction with the Nason Ridge trail, good views open over the valley carved by Mahar Creek. If you look up on Nason Ridge, you can spot a very prominent rock thumb on the ridge; just to the right of the thump is the Alpine lookout.Follow the Nason Ridge trail to the right, cross two seasonal streams and soon you are on the lake shore. You can rest here before pressing onto Lost Lake, or make this your final destination for the day.  WTA Pro Tip: To access Lost Lake, follow the Nason Ridge trail up to the ridge and look for the fisherman’s trail leading down to Lost Lake from the Ridge. If you choose to visit Lost Lake, your hike will be 9 miles round trip, with 3200 feet of elevation gain. Eastern brook trout, descendants of fish hiked in almost a century ago lure fisherman to hike up and cast in both Merritt and Lost Lakes."

Once your supply has been replenished, begin a relentless climb to the ridge top -- this is a trail to a former fire lookout after all. 3000 feet of gain come in three miles of smooth trail. But your reward is miles of ridge walking with views among the best in the Cascades. The views keep you entertained while the ups and downs along the ridgeline keep your legs working.The trail contours below the ridge, goes along the top, and crosses over to the other side several times.

This approach from Highway 2 is dry, but tends to be most favored for snowshoeing and early season access. However, it's the back door route that makes for a much more scenic route, particularly in high summer. Both routes get you to the old lookout site on the top of Rock Mountain, where you'll enjoy excellent views in all directions, and occasional mountain goat sightings. The hike is challenging, but absolutely worth the effort.Approaching Rock Mountain via Snowy Creek is a shorter, less steep hike. Because it's north facing, snow sticks around a little longer, but that also means that gorgeous alpine meadows are full of wildflowers late into the season.From the trailhead, the first mile parallels Snowy Creek, wandering through old-growth forest. At about three-quarters of a mile, there is a very brushy section, where salmonberries and willows abound and winter avalanches come down off Rock Mountain to sweep away any standing timber. The path here is generally free of obstacles, a good thing, since you can’t see your feet due to the brush.  One mile from the Snowy Creek trailhead, a sign points to the Nason Ridge Trail heading west for Rainy Pass on FS6700. If you have time or the inclination, this detour provides a great adventure in routefinding, as it traverses the west end of Nason Ridge to the Rainy Pass Pond you passed on the drive to the trailhead. But back to the route for Rock Mountain. Once past the Nason Ridge turnoff, the trail soon crosses the headwaters of Snowy Creek and the climb begins for real. You have gained 300 feet so far, but you've still got 3000 feet to go. The first climbing section switchbacks across a series of small creeks and springs that appear out of the hillside. At the 2.25-mile point you go slightly downhill and enter a beautiful meadow. From here you can look up to the summit and fill your water bottles. Get a good drink and refill, there isn’t any water from here on.The trail crosses the small stream at the entrance to the meadow and winds adjacent to the stream. The trail used to run along the left side of the meadow, but it was buried in avalanche debris in 2010, so now there are a few social trails across the grass and you will have to pick a path to meet up with the trail where it exits the meadow on the left. Early in the season, the whole meadow is a bit of a bog so take care to keep your socks dry. From here you can look up and see the upper sections of the hike on the wildflower-covered approach to the summit; you don’t often get to see the top of a climb from the bottom, but don’t be intimidated. It's attainable--just take it one step at a time.Once clear of the meadow, the trail climbs steeply up the forested ridge adjacent to the avalanche path that leads down to the meadow. There are old blazes that mark the trail and frequently mountain goats leave wool attached to the huckleberries. This is the only part of the trail where the views underwhelm, so it's best to just put you head down and grind up the hill. The trail touches the avalanche path a few times, and views from here show your progress. After a mile and a half, you are rewarded by leaving the trees behind and starting the traverses up the open slopes that grace the top of this hike.We call this section, “the Sound of Music traverse”, big views and wildflowers, make for one of the nicest one mile sections of trail to be found anywhere. There are a few short switchbacks and few long traverses all decorated in wildflowers early in the season and huckleberries as fall approaches. There are a few trees clinging to the 40 degree (or steeper) slope, making for a very steep meadow.  A few weeks after the snow is off the slope the entire mountainside is draped in lupine, paintbrush, bear grass, and a riot of ground hugging wildflowers.  Vistas stretch south into the Alpine Lakes Wilderness, and west across Stevens Pass.   The trail tops out on a saddle above Rock Lake.  Later in the season, snow cornices often remain along the ridge, so be careful of the edge. There is a chance to chill and refill water bottles here. Walk 200 yards north along the ridgeline, gaining another 200 feet to achieve the summit and the site of the Rock Mountain fire lookout.  Views open north to Glacier Peak, east down Nason Ridge and south over Rock Lake, Highway 2 and into the Alpine Lakes Wilderness.WTA Pro Tip: Groups with two cars can turn this hike into a thru-hike by flipping a coin and having the losers drive to the Rock Mountain via Rock Lake Trail 1587, start from here and meet at the top. This adds an additional 500feet of elevation gain, a half a mile and a less interesting first half to the hike."

It accesses Lake Grace, Big Chiwaukum, Snowgrass Mtn., and Doelle Lakes. Over half of this charming trail is above 5000' in wide-open country.One can do a loop:  Whitepine Ck #1582 -> Wildhorse Ck #1592 -> Frosty Pass -> Icicle Ridge #1570 -> Chain Lakes #1579 -> Icicle Ck #1551 -> Whitepine Ck #1582.  The crux is the Whitepine Ck ford a few hundred yards from the Wildhorse jctn., so check it out before you commit to it; by late July or August, it should be a safe boots-on wade with a good stick near the ruins of the old bridge. Maybe tricky at high water.You'll start buying your altitude on Wildhorse, and soon clear timberline at about 5000' in maybe 2.5 miles, with at least 2 established campsites at permanent streams along the way, in the trees.  There are white pines here.Just past one of these streams is a junction with an obscure trail; this way-trail climbs (perhaps to an old sheep herders' camp?), while the main trail descends slightly. In 2010, a temporary sign marks this spot.Below and west of Lake Grace, the trail descends into a brushy section, perhaps 1.2 mile. This does not last. After crossing some obvious avalanche/flood debris, you'll find the signed jctn. back to Lake Grace.  Note that this is well past the Lake Grace outfall stream.Lake Grace has established campsites. The more adventuresome may scramble to a more alpine environment at Upper Grace Lake (6900').Although the ascent of Big Chiwaukum's true summit requires some careful Class 3 climbing with loose rock, from Upper Grace Lake one can almost reach the summit with an easy Class 1 hands-free walk in an alpine setting along an inspiring, wide-open, easy ridge, reaching 8000'with stunning views.It's a horse trail, so there are some rocky and eroded sections, and it doesn't get a whole lot of maintenance, so it's brushy in places, but on the whole it's a reasonably easy easy trail.At Frosty Pass (5700') is a 4-way junction. Frosty Ck Tr #1592 drops SW to Lake Margaret and Icicle Creek Tr #1551. Icicle Ridge Tr #1570 climbs SE to Lake Mary, Mary's Pass, Upper Florence Lake, and Ladies Pass.  There are two ""Lake Mary Hiker Trail"" signs; if you want to camp above Lake Mary, disregard the first and find two established campsites close by the second sign at 6200', over 100' above the lake. Above the trail near Lake Mary, note the odd, straight east fork of Frosty Creek which flows west into Lake Margaret; it drains a flat basin at 6500', a subalpine wonderland.  From here, one may wander N, then E in easy (possible ice-axe) terrain to the 7420' saddle on Snowgrass Mountain's easy S ridge. To reach the true 7993' summit, you must traverse on big snowfields (scree late season) on the east side before ascending, but if ""close"" is good enough for you, the south ridge is a simple amble on alpine tundra (tiptoe carefully!) to a gendarme that will stop you above 7800'. For the adventuresome, Icicle Ridge Tr #1570 continues NW of Frosty Pass, unmaintained, to Doelle Lakes, over a pass, to Chain Lakes Tr #1569.  In 2010, this trail is quite serviceable.  Follow the two ""Horse Camp"" signs at Frosty Pass, and just continue past the horse camp in mostly open country.  Shortly after this trail crosses to the SW side of the ridge, an obscure path leads N and NNW through a 5550' notch into wide-open hill country between 5000-6000'; perhaps this is an old sheepherders' path?  You are invited to explore.  With a 7.5' map.  If you complete the loop via Icicle Ck Tr# 1551, you'll exercise your trail sense to find and follow upper Whitepine Ck Tr#1582:  there may be a junction sign, the path disappears into a lush meadow, look for an old blaze on the other side (2007). That year, there was some trailfinding, but it was doable in the dark. Monster cedars in the bottomland will silence you.If you brave some snow and go here in June, you'll be rewarded with more attractive, snowy terrain. It looks more barren and sere by September.  Be aware of High Hunt season in late September. Careful cross-country travel is possible.Please treat this place with the utmost respect."

Both trails are two and a half miles long, but the one beginning at Little Wenatchee Falls campground gains a full 3000 feet in elevation. It's guaranteed to get your heart pounding, but Irving Pass is the recommended route, since you spend a significant amount of the hike on the ridge with awesome views both north and south.  Although numerically easier, you'll still get your workout hiking in via Irving Pass; this route hikes harder than it reads on paper. However you reach it, the old lookout site on Poe provides excellent views in all directions. There are no stream crossings, springs or reliable water on this trail so make sure you are adequately supplied. There can be easily crossed snow drifts until midsummer on this trail, so be sure to check WTA's trip reports (below) for current conditions.The first tenth of a mile of the hike is in the sunshine of an old clear cut.  Then the trail climbs 500 feet in a half mile on a well-maintained, moderately switchbacked trail to Irving Pass. After a brief water and snack break, head left on Trail #1545. Nearby, there is an unmaintained trail used by high country hunters that proceeds straight down into Cockeye Creek. It's not your route, and with a name like that, it's worth avoiding.The ridge trail quickly delivers its views; you are walking between trees that have somehow found room to root in the 15 foot flat space on the top of the ridge which drops south to the Little Wenatchee River and north into the White River drainage. Approximately three-quarters of a mile up the ridge is the one challenging point on the trail. Traverse north around a large rock knob. Early in the season this area can be choked with late snow -- if it looks impassible come back another day.  But if the snow is gone, you will be able to proceed 50 yards and do a short, steep climb to rejoin the ridge. Recently an old climbing rope has been left to provide a secure hand up across this section. Once back on the ridge, the views continue off both sides of the trail. In about a mile, climb to what you thought was the summit only to find the true summit in the distance, another half mile away. This section of the trail passes through a number of dense huckleberry patches. Snow can linger in the low swale before the summit. You will come upon a Y junction in the trail, where there is the remnant of a sign post, in the middle of the Y.  Go up to the right. A left here will hook up with Trail #1520 coming up on the other side of the peak.  There are spectacular views from the top of Poe looking north to Glacier Peak,  west up Meander Meadow to Kodak Peak, south to Rock Mountain, and on a clear day Rainer is visible."

This reconfiguration was completed in 2013 and you can see how quickly vegetation takes advantage of the sunlight and fresh soil along the edges of the new trail.The trail wanders through old-growth forest uphill from Lake Creek. Hemlock and cedars tower above hikers in this section. Early in the season, trillium can be found blooming on the forest floor. In 1.3 miles, you cross a substantial bridge over Lake Creek. The warm up is officially over, here you have gained 200 vertical feet, with much more to come.The trail climbs for the next mile and half up the ridge, before leveling out and proceeding to the lake. Parts of the trail seem to be climbing up a root staircase. While these footholds can be helpful, be aware, especially in wet weather, roots can become quite slippery when damp.Occasionally, the trail will jog out of the roots and do a few switchbacks. Once you clear the ridge, the trail is generally level for the last three-quarters of a mile through huckleberry bushes to the lake edge.Looking across the lake to the west there is a rounded peak visible. This is Grizzly Peak.

But the reward for your efforts is an eastside gateway into the stunning North Cascades National Park. At the pass, you’re greeted by trickling streams of snowmelt and views of the peaks of Golden Horn and Mount Henry to the east. Venturing further west, gaze into the park, with awe-inspiring glacially carved river valleys, the dark gray craggy massifs of Fisher Peak and Mount Logan dotted with snowfields or cloaked by glaciers, and a host of wildflowers. Set off from the trailhead just off of Highway 20, immediately entering forested lowlands. Cross a creek on a large log bridge, complete with a stairstep approach and a handrail for safety while crossing wide, silty Granite Creek. Note how close you are to the trailhead; you may want to take a dip in the creek on the way back to your car, particularly if the day is hot. Continue through rolling forest, surrounded by queens cup, vanilla leaf, and other flora sprinkled among the trunks of cedars and pines. The trail takes you up and down through this landscape, but generally gains elevation for about a mile and a half. Arrive at a creek crossing spanned by several logs not very securely set across the stream. This is Easy Pass Creek and in spring, it can run high. Have your trekking poles at the ready – they are invaluable in getting safely across. But if the water is running high, consider making this your turnaround point and trying for the pass another time. Cross Easy Pass Creek and leave the forest behind. Now you’re hiking along the floor of a valley, in a wide, rocky alpine meadow. From here on, the hike is exposed, with very few opportunities for shade, so slather on some sunscreen and proceed through the valley. Two passes are in evidence here – Easy Pass is the one directly in front of you, with a large rocky peak to the north. Many a hiker has exclaimed, “That can’t be it, it looks too easy!” Don’t be fooled. It’s still quite a climb. A the head of the valley, re-enter forest for a short while. After a couple of switchbacks through welcome shade, re-cross Easy Pass Creek (this time it’s a much more secure crossing) and begin switchbacking up a steep talus slope. Easy Pass is on a fault line, so the talus frequently slides, and WTA work parties clear trail here over the summer, moving tons of loose rock to re-establish the trail. Continue through a lush green section of the trail, with Easy Pass Creek always within earshot, if not visible. Consider refilling your water bottle here the next time you see the creek. There is no more reliable water source until the pass; only about a mile away, but a very steep, exposed mile. And in late summer, if the snow is melted, there may be no water at all at the pass. Climb up several switchbacks into a hanging valley. Now comes the final push. The trail carries you along the edge of the meadow, with a rocky boulder field on your left. Gradually leave the greenery for the rocks as you hike ever higher to the pass. Here too, WTA work parties have improved trail, installing rock steps and recarving the trail that leads to your destination. Throw down your pack and have a drink of water. Maybe reapply some sunscreen, and grab your camera. The views in every direction are spectacular and will keep you occupied for a long rest. Explore the pass in every direction, and then head back the way you came. The way down is easier than the way up. WTA Pro Tip: Incorporate Easy Pass into a fall “Larch March”. Take a long weekend and head to the North Cascades, an area chock-full of hikes lined by larches, which turn an arresting gold in the autumn."

The current lookout tower, built in 1933 and restored in 1998, is listed on the National Historic Lookout Register.The trail to Sourdough’s summit wastes no time letting its true intention be known: to climb up and out of the towering conifers into open meadowlands with breathtaking views galore. In the first 2 miles alone, hikers will be faced with a climb of 3,000 vertical feet. The grueling switchbacks will seem endless, but rest assured they are not. The forest gradually thins, offering some motivating peekaboo views of what lies ahead.At 4 miles, carefully cross rushing Sourdough Creek, the trail’s first water source, before continuing your ascent on more gently graded tread.

Linger a while and be rejuvenated by the 360-degree views sprawling before you. Mount Prophet and Hozomeen Mountain dominate the northern skyline, while Jack Mountain rises to 9,000 feet in the east, the jagged Picket Range lines the horizon to the west, and to the south, Pyramid and Colonial Peaks jut high above the turquoise waters of Diablo Lake, nearly a vertical mile below."

A mountain bike course, playground, and several picnic areas dot the trailside, and with various access points to the town of Castle Rock, it’s easy to duck off for a quick bite in town. Begin just south of town, at Lions Pride Park. The parking here can bit a bit unusual since it’s just an empty roadside lot with no delineated spots, but there is plenty of room and it’s infrequently crowded. Just be sure to leave room for other cars. From the parking lot, walk north along the paved trail. For the first quarter mile, the road parallels the Business Loop of I-5 through Castle Rock. While it’s not heavily traveled, traffic so near can be a bit disconcerting. Don’t worry – you’ll move away from it soon enough. Skirt the eastern edge of a large wooded hillside. Before the greenery grew up, this was recognizable as Castle Rock, the location after which the town nearby was named. Settlers built their homesteads in its shade, before the dike you are walking along was constructed to prevent flooding in the low lying farmland nearby. Now trees almost completely obscure the rock, but it remains a nice balance to the road nearby. Notice a wide graveled path making a large switchback up Castle Rock. This detour, while not ADA-accessible, does provide the only uphill available on this walk. If you take it, you’ll gain about 150 feet of elevation as you hike to the summit of the rock, where a covered picnic area awaits. Views are limited, thanks to the large trees that have grown up and around it, but the river glints through the leaves below, and it’s a nice spot to sit and enjoy your surroundings before continuing on. You can return to the trail the way you came up, or you can follow the other end of the loop to where it reconnects with the paved trail near milepost .3. As the trail turns away from the road, it begins to parallel the Cowlitz River. As you walk, look for interpretive signs telling of the history of the area, including past floods, the town's fishing and logging history, and the first settlers to the area.Just shy of a mile you’ll see a skate park on the left-hand side of the trail, and shortly after that are a mountain bike course and BMX bike course. Soon the trail dips below the A Street bridge over the Cowlitz and a bench near the river provides a nice spot to sit a while. Past the bridge are more picnic areas and access to the town of Castle Rock via a switchbacked ramp that links up to Shintaffer Avenue. Continue along the trail – there’s only about half a mile of it left! A boat launch is visible across the way, and fishermen are often active around here. As you walk past town, a small park on the right hand side that houses some cheerful flowers marks the end of the trail. It slopes downhill slightly to a large turn where a picnic table and another bench sit, perfect for watching the river slip by."

Be sure to bring hiking poles or good shoes – the descent can be almost as challenging as the uphill. Your trail begins from the large parking area on the north side of Stevens Pass. This is a large lot, so to better orient yourself, find the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) trailhead at the far east end – a wide pathway disappearing into a green tunnel. Just west of this trailhead is a red building and a service road to the left of the building. That’s where you’re heading. Follow the service road as it passes some lodgings for Stevens Pass employees, then turns north. The trail passes under powerlines as you head towards a gated, even steeper service road.

Continue past this and carry onwards and upwards. The trail eventually opens out to an excellent view of the Stevens Pass Ski Area across the highway. In summer, you’ll see the mountain bike trails lacing the hill across the way, making a great vista and photo opportunity. Continue up, up and up, switchbacking steeply through huckleberry and pine trees on the service road. One mile from the parking lot is an easy-to-miss junction. A faint trail to the left may be marked by cairns – this is your trail to the lake. The last quarter mile is a reprieve from the incessant climbing – you’ll gently climb through a field of heather and huckleberries to a lake that lies quietly high above Stevens Pass. In summer when the lake has receded a bit, there are many spots along the shoreline to sit on the beach and have a snack, and the clear waters, lush pine trees, and flitting birds make this a relaxing getaway for an area so close to a major Washington highway. WTA Pro Tip: If you want a little more climb, head back to the main trail and turn left. The trail continues up a little ways more to views over Nason Ridge. This will give you about a half mile more round trip before you return to your vehicle in the pass."

Once on the trail, you are instantly in woods. First, you hike about a mile, crossing two creeks, until you reach the first junction at 600 feet elevation.At this first junction, take the right hand trail, the East Ridge Trail, heading up toward Central Peak. This is a good hard pull up to the peak, fairly steep with a lot of switchbacks. After a mile and a half on this trail, at about 1400 feet, you will reach a junction with the East Side Trail to your right going fairly level or the continuation of the East Ridge Trail to your left and up. For a loop, you can choose either one and take the other coming down. If you keep going up the ridge, hike along to the next junction with Phil's Creek, at about half a mile. Stay right on what is now briefly part of Phil's Creek trail, and after a very short time (.1 mile or so) you will reach another junction with Phil's Creek to your right, and Summit Trail to your left. To go straight up to the summit, take the left. This is a steep trail, but a lovely one. Come out onto paved road, the South Access Road, which is closed to the public for driving, but hikers often use it. Uphill and to your right a very short distance up the road is the Central Peak, as one hiker says, ""Well, it is certainly towerful"". There are tiny peekaboo views between trees along the road and at the peak.Stay to the left of the towers and the Central Peak Trail heads down and to the west through a gate meant to bar horses and bikes, on a fairly gentle grade. Almost immediately you come to a junction with the Old Griz Trail. You can make the small or medium size loops by taking this down to either the Phil's Creek Trail for the small loop, 8.5 mi roundtrip. Or take the East Side trail for the medium loop, a little over 9 mi round trip. For a longer loop, about 10 miles round trip, continue down Central Peak, staying right at the junction with the Bullitt Fireplace Trail, then about a half mile to the next junction with the Fireplace trail as that bends to meet you. Turn right, then right again after .2 mi at the junction with the East Side Trail, which runs mostly level. Stay on this trail past the junction with Old Griz at about .8 miles, then take the left-most trail at the junction with the East Ridge trail after another mile. You can also make a loop by taking the Bullitt fireplace trail. Be sure and bring a map - all those junctions can be confusing!In all cases, you will return the last 2.5 miles down the East Ridge and out the Access trail, passing the condos the same way you came in. If you park at the Sunrise Place by the Access Trail entrance, all mileage counts will be less by about 2 miles."

A dedicated group of enthusiastic WTA volunteers worked countless hours here, carving a connector trail out of the steep, rugged hillside from the top of Cleator Road to the South Lost Lake Trail. The Rock Trail provides hikers and trail runners a steep climb, gorgeous views, and a peek at the area's fascinating geology. From the large parking lot at the Cleator Road trailhead, hikers get sneak peeks of Puget Sound through the trunks and branches of tall trees that surround the crown of the hill. But the trail begins descending almost immediately.  Though the way is steep -- count the number of stairs you encounter -- the route provides plenty of opportunity to enjoy the beauty of Larrabee State Park. Within a half-mile  of the upper trailhead are 100-foot high  sandstone cliffs pocked by little holes and large caves. Enormous mossy boulders lie all around you. This area provides an excellent diversion or rest stop for young hikers .While unusual sandstone formations are common at Larrabee State Park, hikers typically find them near the beach. But the cliffs on the Rock Trail are interesting because they share characteristics with the seaside rocks, despite being far removed from the shoreline. After exploring the imposing rocks, keep heading down through moss and licorice ferns, crossing a creek via ""Bogaards Bridge"", named for the WTA crew leaders who helped make the trail a reality.  Be sure to look up and out as you hike; on clear days, Mount Baker and the Twin Sisters glide into view just past the bridge. Continuing down, hikers clamber down three steep sets of stairs and wind through three more switchbacks until the trail flattens out. A huge boulder to the right of the trail, about three-quarters of a mile in , hides an interesting cave for exploring. From here the junction with the South Lost Lake Trail is quite close. Press on, and note how high the trees soar above your head! At the beginning of your hike, you could see over the tops of some of the trees whose bases you're now walking by. The end of the Rock Trail is marked by a wooden gate with a sign that indicates 'Hiker Only.'  The steepness of the trail is prohibitive to stock and mountain bikers, but other trails in Larrabee State Park are multi-use . If you plan to continue your hike as a loop, keep in mind you may encounter other trail users, and be sure to exercise proper trail etiquette."

What more could you ask for? While the throngs of summer visitors are heading to the end of the road at Sunrise Point, pull off into the corner viewpoint parking area near the top. The trail starts across the road and heads downhill to Sunrise Lake, the first of many you’ll encounter. It’s nice, but keep going. Passing over rocky sections of trail, listen and look for pikas; if you’re quiet you’ll be able to spot them. At 1.5 miles is Clover Lake. Here you’ll find an array of wildflowers surrounding the lake. Again, nice, but you’ll want to keep going. Continue past a small grove of skeletal silver trees and come to Tom, Dick and Harry Lakes’ Dick Camp. It’s often buggy here, and the camp is nothing spectacular. The real gem is the 0.5-mile side trip to Hidden Lake—you will not be disappointed! In the morning light the reflections of the Upper Palisades rocks and Marcus Peak are a sight to behold—and you just might have this place all to yourself. Camping is not permitted here, but you can take a dip in the lake or scramble up Marcus Peak for higher vistas. After you’ve had your fill at Hidden Lake, return to the main trail and continue to Upper Palisades Lake, less than a mile farther. Along the way you will cross a field of lupine with the Palisades rocks towering above. If you start early enough to get here during morning light, the scene is especially magical. Now on to Upper Palisades Lake, the prettiest of all the lakes, replete with lots of wildflowers, big boulders and sandy shores. The water is crystal clear and refreshing—but cold! Several marmots live here. Look for them sunning on the boulders or near their burrows.WTA Pro Tip: Scramble up to Brown’s Peak from Upper Palisades Lake to see some big views of Mounts Rainier and Adams and the Enchantments Range."

Because the network of trails on the Tradition Plateau is fairly complex, it will be helpful to refer to the Green Trails Map, No 204S, and it will be clear from the map that there are several options for a loop hike that includes the Big Tree Trail.Many hikers will find our Tradition Lake Loop a particularly satisfying route. It leaves the main High Point Trailhead and takes the Around the Lake Trail, the Bus Trail, the Wetlands Trail and the Brink Trail (briefly,) to reach the Big Tree Trail. After you hike the Big Tree Trail, the route continues on via the Swamp Trail to return to the main trailhead. For important details, check the WTA Hiking Guide for the Tradition Lake Loop.Other routes leaving the main High Point Trailhead that include the Big Tree Trail will be evident from the map.

Eaten too much bratwurst in Leavenworth and need a walk in the woods to settle your stomach? Want a moderate flat snowshoe with a beautiful winter destination?  The short trail to Hidden Lake adjacent to Lake Wenatchee is the answer to all of these requests. Quite popular in summer, especially when the state park campground is full and the wind is up on the lake. About five years ago the trailhead for this trail was moved up off the Cedar Brae Road from Glacier View Campground and a new trail was constructed with a wide tread, and an easy grade.  The first half-mile is ADA-accessible, as the trail winds up through old-growth fir and large cedars. Challenge kids to find to the two “cave trees”, old cedars where lightning long ago burned out caves into their bases. The trail traverses west providing peek-a-boo views of Lake Wenatchee and Dirty Face Mountain.Just before reaching the lake you will cross an outlet stream with a few old logs used as a bridge. There are a number of picnic spots left of the outlet stream, the main access to the lake is up a small knob after crossing the outlet stream,  On the knob there are a half dozen very large ponderosa pines above the lake edge. If you turn around, back to the lake, and look north, you will see a trail marked by a large ponderosa which has been cut to let the trail pass through. This is the original trail, which goes down to Glacier View campground.  By following this trail down you can turn the hike into a loop, and stretch out the mileage to 2.5 miles total. Glacier view, as the name implies, has an incredible view of Glacier Peak, across Lake Wenatchee and up the White River valley.  You re-cross the outlet stream just above the campground on rocks in the stream, (not recommended early in the season). The only downside to this addition is a short road walk. To get back to the parking lot it is fastest to just walk up the road, about a half a mile, as opposed to retracing your steps. The trail down to Glacier View drops you below the parking area so you will climb an additional 200 feet back for a total of 400 feet.If you are looking for more, there is a very nice out and back trail that follows the lake edge for roughly three-quarters of a mile, below the forest service cabins along the lakeshore. This trail can be found at the east end of the campground.WTA Pro Tip: This trail is snowshoe-able! In winters, Cedar Brae Road is plowed to the end of the pavement. Park here and snowshoe out along the dirt section of the road for a mile, watch for the sign to the parking area on the left, the trail is popular enough that you will often find tracks to follow."

The western slope of the Cascades is home to the sooty blue grouse. Males have blue-gray feathers, complemented by orange and white accents. Females are smaller and less flashy, mildly decorated with brown and gray coloring. To spot one, tread softly and listen for a “whoomp!” calling sound. Look for areas of disturbed soil and stray feathers where the birds are known for “graveling.”You may not be the only one camping out for grouse-gatherings. The brush offers good coverage for sneaky bobcats, who crouch and watch their prey before pouncing on the chicken-sized birds. While bobcats are reclusive by nature and mostly quiet, when they do make noise, it can be rather upsetting if you don’t know what to expect. A noisy bobcat often sounds like a woman screaming or a baby crying. Ready for some wildlife spotting? Set out on the woodland trail, crossing over and around several tributaries on their way to Cussed Hollow Creek. Steadily descend into Cussed Hollow through western white pine, Douglas fir, and Silver fir trees before turning uphill around 1 mile. Pop out around the ridge at 2.5 miles.

A good stop if you have a car full of restless children or you are  showing off the area to visiting relatives. The views from the top are a big payoff for such a short hike. Begin your hike by walking through the campground along the well signed trail for Thunder Knob. Reach a braided Colonial Creek and cross on a series of bridges. This creek has been known to be a bit temperamental, changing directions and flooding everything in its path. If you are hiking this in the winter, be aware that the bridges are taken down at the end of the summer season to prevent the river damaging them.Once across the river, you will see the former rocky creek bed. Follow the rock-lined path through it, and end up at the edge of the forest. Enter the forest and notice how beautifully green it is, a mossy carpet under the hemlock and salal and draped over decaying logs. As you work your way up a bit higher, watch how the forest changes in just a matter of a few hundred feet. Now it is a drier forest of lodgepole pine, the ground is more rocky and exposed, the moss gone. The forest you just hiked through is just low enough to catch moisture, while the higher trail shows the effect of a small rain shadow created by the surrounding peaks.Rest on one of the benches, or take a few pictures of Colonial Peak at this first viewpoint. After the viewpoint, the trail climbs a little, then heads down and across a marsh. The marsh can be quite scenic when full of water, reflecting the grasses at the edge, but may dry up later in the season.From the marsh, hike up and reach the top of Thunder Knob.  A short spur to the left will take you to benches to rest, eat a snack (but watch out for thieving chipmunks), and take in the views. From this viewpoint, look below you at the clear turquoise water of Diablo Lake (actually a reservoir) and Diablo Dam in the distance. Diablo Dam was completed in 1930 and at 389 feet was the highest dam in the world at that time. The beautiful opaque turquoise water is a result of 'rock flour', silt that is carried downstream from underneath melting glaciers high in the peaks above. The tiny particles are suspended in the water and the way the light is reflected off the lake is perceived by our eyes as the striking blue green. If you hike earlier in the year, the color will be bluer, in late summer, the color will be greener.Look up and see the ridge of Sourdough Mountain and the snowfield of Davis Peak. A short trail leads to another viewpoint, looking across toward Jack Mountain and down toward the narrow channel of Diablo Lake. The valley still looks steep and wild; imagine for a minute what the Skagit River and this valley once looked like before the dams were built. Return along the same path. WTA Pro Tip: There is so much to see and do in the North Cascades. Stay at Colonial Creek campground and hike more of the many trails close by. The Pyramid Lake trail is a fairly short trail signed just after you cross Gorge Lake. The Thunder Creek trail is long but gentle as it follows Thunder Creek up a wild valley. It takes off at the end of the campground on the other side of highway 20. On your way back, stop and hike to Ladder Falls, a short hike behind the power plant in Newhalem. At night, this path has a colored light show."

This is a long hike, best done as a backpack, but it's absolutely worth the days you invest to explore here. Plan to spend at least five days tackling this trail, as the trail is a long one, and while the approach involves minimal elevation gain at first, once you start climbing up Miner's Ridge, you'll get quite a quad workout. Plus, the scenery is so gorgeous, and the potential for wandering so extensive, you'll be glad you set aside a few days to explore. Begin your quest to Image Lake from the newly-reopened Suiattle River Road. From the Suiattle River trailhead, located at the end of the road, hike 9.5 miles along the rushing, mighty Suiattle River. There are three camps sprinkled along this section of the trail, so you'll have somewhere to lay your head if you decide to camp down here on your first night. Along this 9.5 mile approach, you'll cross a suspension bridge over Canyon Creek and then come to your first junction .3 miles past the bridge. Take the left-hand trail, and continue on a gently inclining traverse for 2.5 miles to your turnoff for Miners Ridge. Shift into low gear and begin climbing; you'll go from 2800 feet to 6000 feet over the next 5.5 miles. The trail switchbacks relentlessly up, crossing several seasonal creeks. 3.3 miles in, arrive at a junction. Keep left here. Going right will take you to Suiattle Pass, Holden, even the little hamlet of Stehekin. All these are worthy jaunts, just not the one you're on today. Press on and up the switchbacks. 2.2 miles from the junction arrive at the top of the ridge. Here you can take a brief side trip to the Miner's Ridge lookout. This is only 0.4 miles away and 208 feet higher. It's a gorgeous lookout; one of the last ones still standing in good shape in the North Cascades, but it's closed to the public. Make the trek and take photos, but please respect the closure and do not attempt to enter. Once you've gotten your fill of views from here, head back to the junction at the top of the ridge. Continue on the right-hand fork, and after less than half a mile, you'll arrive at another junction. You're nearly there! Here, where the trail splits, you can go either way to circumnavigate the lake and find a camp spot.

A few giant firs and cotton-woods still stand tall within the lush gulch. John Lund first homesteaded this rugged tract of paradise back in 1878, and it's nicely reverting back to its wilder days. The trail follows the small creek also named after Lund. Bubbling and babbling, it makes its short journey to the Sound. Come each fall, a handful of salmon make their way up the creek to spawn.In 1 mile the trail comes to a junction. The path left leads to the ranger's residence and to picnic tables scattered about on a manicured lawn.

The lake is popular among fisherman, since it is home to lots of trout, but be warned -- route-finding skills are a must on this trip. On the far side of the Gateway bridge turn right and follow the wide, WTA-built Pratt Connector trail until it crosses Rainy Creek (see Hiking Guide entry for Middle Fork Snoqualmie: Downstream). The Pratt Connector was a three-year project for WTA, utilizing hundreds of volunteers to create a safe way for hikers to access Rainy Lake. Before the trail was constructed, many hikers were fording the river, a dangerous attempt. Now a wide trail leads hikers through airy forest and large granite boulders along the side of the mighty Snoqualmie River. About a quarter-mile down the trail, take a small spur trail as it executes a neat switchback up and away from the Pratt Connector. This is the Rainy Lake trail, which hugs the west side of Rainy Creek for the entire length of the trail. Depending on the time of year, crossing Rainy Creek may be difficult, but once across, the trail is lovely. Follow the narrow, sometimes very faint boot path through lush forest and mossy undergrowth. Rainy Creek is your constant companion as you follow it ever upward toward the lake. The path alternates between brutal inclines and occasional plateaus, over a few blowdowns and straight up talus fields. The occasional views of Mount Garfield are excellent and the faint trail lends a pleasant feeling of seclusion.Near your destination, climb a little higher than the lake to cross over a rounded ridge and then descends to the outlet stream.Rainy Lake lies beneath the exposed rock face of Preacher Mountain. It's not been officially maintained for years, except for the occasional ""trail angel"", so it does not make for an easy or quick side trip, but it's a worthwhile endeavor for those seeking a more solitary adventure or a challenging hike. Certainly Rainy Lake would be a great base camp for those who want to summit Preacher or the Pulpit, but it is also a lovely and peaceful destination in itself."

Hike under a cave and enjoy the spray from the falls, but be careful - the trail drops steeply away off to your left here and a wrong step can mean a far fall.After getting your fill of the falls, continue on for about a half mile until you arrive at a junction with Goat Creek. Go straight ahead here, and find another creek crossing in another half mile. Stop here to cool your heels and soak in the sights and sounds of nature surrounding you before you head home."

From the Middle Fork Road, drive to the end and park at the Snoqualmie Lake Trailhead, 12 miles from the beginning of the Middle Fork Snoqualmie Road. Start from the small parking area and admire the wide Taylor River as you cross a paved bridge. Pass a couple of dispersed camping sites and come to a junction with the Quartz Creek trail branching off to the left at about 0.5 miles. Take the right fork, staying on a relatively flat, rocky trail that heads through quiet forest. Moss-laden birches, western redcedars, and western hemlocks tower over you. Along the trail, Taylor River rushes past you, and craggy Garfield Peak plays hide-and-seek through the trees. Near a creek crossing, the forest opens up, offering hikers a glimpse of a spire of Treen Peak.After three miles, come to a large bridge spanning roaring Marten Creek. A bootpath veers off to the left just before the bridge – a mile’s hike up this primitive, overgrown trail takes you to Marten Lake. Take photos at the bridge and then press on, crossing roughly ten drainages before the turn-off for Otter Falls. With spring’s high waters, some of these crossings can be tricky. Hiking poles are very helpful in high water. Keep in mind that rocks can be loose or slippery with moss – don’t attempt any crossing that you feel uncomfortable tackling. Pass the turnoff for Otter Falls and just around the corner, find yourself at Big Creek Falls, visible from the second bridge on your hike, a large concrete affair, another remnant from the days of logging in this area."

Enjoy the deciduous forest with a few large trees, and appreciate the moss and ferns along the creek. There's also an option to extend your hike to include the historic district of Des Moines Beach Park, and stroll out onto the Des Moines Public Fishing Pier for the view.With the optional extensions included, this can be a diverse and interesting hike. However, depending on your sensitivities, there could be some downsides. First, Des Moines Creek drains an area adjoining the southern end of the busy Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, and planes taking off frequently pass directly over the northern trailhead. After the first few, you may find you can tune out the noise and still enjoy your hike. Also, a quarter-mile segment of the trail passes Midway Sewer District's wastewater treatment facility. Fortunately, there generally is no odor or noise, and you will get past it soon enough and regain the forest environment.Ready to take it on? Let's go! Head south on that wide paved trail that probably looks more like a freeway. It even has a yellow line painted down the middle. Hikers and bicyclists share the route, and ""traffic"" does go in both directions. To the west of the northern trailhead there's an area with a network of paths set aside for mountain bikers. While the Des Moines Creek Trail itself would probably seem too tame for them, some may use the trail to access their preferred area.For the first half mile or so, the right edge of the trail sports an extensive growth of invasive Himalayan blackberries. In summer, you might find a ready selection of ripe and tasty berries to supplement any snacks you are carrying.As you progress down the trail, the trees seem to become larger and lean in over the trail. The creek, at first not evident, becomes more obvious as you continue on. In summer the water level may be low, although it can be much higher at other times of the year. In some steeper sections the soft sounds of flowing water will offer a pleasant contrast to any airplane noises you may have heard. In some areas the steep creek banks are highly eroded and display interesting sedimentary layers.Distances along the trail are marked off every quarter mile on small ""mileposts"" installed beside the trail. Also, you will find occasional benches for your relaxation. As you add up the quarter-miles, here are some things you will note along the way:At about 0.85 miles, a fancy bridge and stair structure on the left crosses the creek and connects with a path heading up the hill. There are no signs to indicate where it might lead. If you were to explore that path, you would find it forks after about 400 feet. The right fork leads out to a neighborhood trailhead near the corner of S 212 St and 15th Ave S. The left fork leads, in about 0.3 mile, to S 216th St, a quarter-mile west of 20th Ave S. Back on the Des Moines Creek Trail, a similar set of stairs occurs at about 1.1 miles, this time on the right, and again without any signage. That path leads up the hill and, in about 300 feet, reaches a neighborhood trailhead near the corner of S 211th Pl and 13th Ave S.You can explore the side paths if you like. They provide alternative ways of entering the canyon, but they will be of interest mostly to residents or visitors who already are in one of those neighborhood areas. For other hikers, the northern trailhead is the preferred entry point.At 1.2 miles, the trail bends sharply to the right and begins a traverse along an open hillside. Close by on the left is the high chain-link fence surrounding the wastewater treatment plant. Unlike the similar plant in Seattle's Discovery Park, there has been no effort to disguise this plant behind high walls or botanical barriers. You do have the option of turning around here, but in another quarter-mile you will have passed the wastewater plant and will be back in the trees along the creek.At 1.8 miles, the trail passes under a massive concrete support structure where Hwy 509 (Marine View Drive) crosses over the canyon.At 2.0 miles, buildings and a turn-around loop appear up ahead. It's the end of the Des Moines Creek Trail itself, and the beginning of the 19.6-acre Des Moines Beach Park. You can turn around here if you like and head back to the northern trailhead. Or, consider the following.Extending Your HikeYou might enjoy exploring a bit farther, adding at most an extra mile to your round trip distance. The foot trail continues on through the park, and is well-marked by signs as it heads toward the beach. The park has a number of buildings dating from earlier days of Des Moines. A few small buildings could use some work, but many have been beautifully restored and now are used as a community Event Center. Conferences sometimes are held here, and on a summer weekend you might find yourself at a free outdoor concert or a play -- even Shakespeare is performed here! A number of signs in the park offer interesting comments on the early history of this area that began as a logging camp, then became a church camp before it was a park. Or, you can read the same signs online at desmoinesartscommission.com/heritage-trail.html .As you approach the stony beach, there are views out to Puget Sound and the Des Moines Public Fishing Pier. To reach the pier, leave the park at the SE corner, go a block south on Cliff Drive, then turn right and head toward the pier. It's often busy, with many folks out with their fishing rods or crab traps hoping for a good day's catch. You might as well walk out to the end of the pier for the best views of the sound and back toward the park. Then turn around and head back to the northern trailhead, now 2.5 miles away."

Thanks to work done by WTA and Mountains to Sound Greenway, hikers can now turn right (downstream) on the fine new Pratt Connector Trail. At a junction one-quarter mile in, a boot path leads to Rainy Lake and Preacher Mountain. Just a short drive from civilization, this is a good moderate choice if you're seeking a relaxing, riverside ramble.The Pratt Connector turns right after the bridge and continues downstream to the Pratt River. WTA crews worked three years to build this trail as a safe option for hikers who were fording the Middle Fork Snoqualmie River for access to the Pratt River Trail. The new connector is a flat, fast highway; a less-challenging walk perfect for getting out when the weather is bad up high. Some creek crossings do require a little balancing, but using trekking poles for stability should take care of that. At the turnoff for Rainy Lake one-quarter mile in, a path leads up and to the left of the Pratt Connector to Rainy Lake and Preacher Mountain. As you near the Pratt River, turn left at the signed junction -- turning right leads to ""Big Tree"" -- and climb one switchback to an old logging railroad grade, which continues on moss-covered railroad ties far up the valley on a straight, even grade with some minor washouts.This forest was logged in the 1930s and '40s and recovered poorly, so you'll hike through a dense monoculture of unthinned Douglas firs with a lot of the biggest stumps you'll ever see. You'll find some artifacts of the old railroad, but please don't take anything.If you can arrange a car-swap with partners, a thru-hike to the Talapus Lake or Granite Mountain trailhead is a great way to extend your hike and explore even more of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness."

Here you can either turn around and head back to the trailhead, making it a four mile roundtrip hike, or carry on to the Middle Fork Campground through the second-growth forest, with occasional views of the valley to your right."

The Middle Fork Snoqualmie Road benefited from these efforts, which constructed the CCC Road, a 13.5 mile long route that parallels (roughly) the Middle Fork Snoqualmie Road. The Lower Section can be tricky to navigate, as it borders private property, and signage here can send mixed messages. The trail itself is on DNR land, but be sure to bring an up-to-date map to verify your location as you hike.However, the Blowout Creek Trailhead offers a more secluded adventure, despite its route along an old road. Climb a moderate grade alongside Blowout Creek for almost a mile before arriving at the CCC Road Trail. This accounts for nearly half the elevation you'll gain on this trail. At the junction for the CCC Road Trail, turn left and hike west along a wide track. As you climb,  be sure to look south at some gorgeous panoramas of the Middle Fork Snoqualmie River valley. Just short of three and a half miles from the trailhead, listen for a dull roar. This is the rushing water of Brawling Creek as it plummets down a rocky edifice in a series of waterfalls.

Across the creek, large boulders make a nice place to rest and throw rocks in the water.Once across the creek, continue hiking through magnificent old-growth forest. The trail leaves the river now and heads up and over the cliff. You can hear the river below as you switchback up through moss-covered boulders and ferny undergrowth. This mossy forest floor is home to many types of plants. Look for the showy white flowers of trillium in spring. In addition to the more traditionally recognizable flowers, plants with no chlorophyll that live on decaying organic matter thrive here. Watch for a ground-hugging leaf with a white stripe down the middle: the rattlesnake orchid. Come back in the summer and look for its bloom, tubular white flowers on a short stalk. The forest floor also is home to a colorful saprophyte called pine drops, whose flowers are salmon-yellow urn shaped flowers on an orange stem. Another saprophyte, pinesap, is similar in color but shorter. In the fall this same forest floor will also support a variety of mushrooms. The trail drops down a little to a nice campsite, and short of three miles, there will be another log footbridge. Cross the bridge over Sawyer creek and notice the abundance of huckleberry bushes. Pick a few to add to pancakes. If you're camping, this is a reminder to bearproof your food in your site-they like the berries as much as you do.Continue on as the trail takes a gentle up and down course along the ridge. As you approach the river again, listen for the loud roaring sound that indicates a waterfall. The river falls in several short steps, reaches a narrow chasm, then churns through it. Picture time! Play with your camera settings and try to capture it in motion, but be careful when lining up the shot; the drop off is steep and the moss slippery. Once you pass the waterfall the trail drops down, breaks out of the woods and into an old avalanche ravine. Here may be some views of the surrounding peaks, if the weather is cooperating. Keep heading down along the flats and reach the river again in five and a half miles. There will be a trail junction and a sign. The right side climbs the ridge to Sawyer Pass and Tonga Ridge. Follow the left fork to some nice campsites along the river.

And because it is an active volcano, it is best not to put it off for too long. Climbing to the crater rim is an opportunity to see not only amazing views in every direction, but to see geology raw, unformed and in its making.The hike is hard, but requires no technical climbing skills. The trailhead is known as the Climbers’ Bivouac. The first 2.1 miles climbs 1000 feet through forests and open meadows to the Loowit Trail, which circuits the mountain. This section of trail is described in detail in WTA’s Hiking Guide as Ptarmigan Trail. Continuing much past the Loowit Trail requires a climber’s permit (details below). This is where the trail ascends to Monitor Ridge, and the way gets more difficult from here. The next 2500 vertical feet is through boulder fields – and not any ordinary boulder fields. These rocks are dusted with an ash pumice than tends to shred the skin. You’d be wise to bring garden gloves for this section! It can also be windy, so bring layers and a jacket as well.The last section of trail climbs about 1000 vertical feet through ash and small rocks to the crater rim. It’s described by many as “two steps forward and one step back.” Gaiters and long pants are a good choice here. And to get your mind off of the slow slog, be sure to take in the views! You are going upward and before you know it you will be standing on the summit.The scene at the top is almost surreal – the huge crater with a dome growing rapidly in size each year and the state’s newest glacier forming a horseshoe around it. And the incredible views to Mount Adams, Mount Hood, Mount Rainier floating above the blue-green undulating hills surrounding them. Be sure to stay well-back from the rim while taking photos; this is a cornice and could easily break under your feet.After enjoying the top, it is time to head down. Trekking poles are a big help for the knees. Depending upon the time of year, it is also possible to glissade down part of the mountain (but be cautious).The fine print about climbing Mount St. Helens: Permits for climbing above 4800 feet are required year-round and are available for purchase online through the Mount St. Helens Institute's website at http://mshinstitute.org/index.php/climbing/index. If you're climbing between April 1 and October 31, a limited number of people are allowed to climb the mountain on any given day. Permits can run out, so be sure to purchase yours well in advance of your trip. Snagging a permit for peak summer travel is best done in spring, but some permits are available on a first-come, first-serve basis at the Lone Fir Resort in Cougar. Most permits for weekends during spring and summer hiking season are sold out during the first week they are made available for purchase.Winter climbers can self-issue their permits at the Climber's Bivouac trailhead. No fee is required for permits between November 1 and March 31."

Do it in a day, or plan to camp along the way—this hike is both beautiful and a bit of a challenge; you’ll need a little scrambling experience to be comfortable hiking the whole thing. From the Toutle trailhead off of Forest Road 8123, look for the trailhead kiosk near the now washed-out parking lot. The trail heads off just behind the kiosk, and bends west, meandering through a wide lahar (outflow from St. Helens’ 1980 explosion and a subsequent flood). All around you is a ghost forest of dead trees and gray ash and rock, but a small creek, Coldspring Creek, flows through this valley bottom, and fireweed blooms nearby. Follow signs for the Toutle Trail on a westerly course to a crossing of Coldspring Creek about a mile from the trailhead. The crossing is done on downed logs across the creek; trekking poles here will help. Once across, the trail abruptly enters forest, transitioning from the gray of the lahar to deep greens and browns of old- and second-growth forest. Hike through the forest, made up primarily of grand fir and hemlock above, and carpeted with oxalis and ferns below your feet, for 1.7 miles. Early on in this stretch is an overlook offering a small peek at Blue Lake – more green than blue, actually. You'll not access Blue Lake on this hike, but you'll have access to other water, should you need to refill.Huckleberries and blueberries line the path you hike, which is a gradual incline to 4000 feet, where you find a junction with the Blue Horse Trail off to your right. Continue past this junction, now descending 0.6 miles to a switchback and a junction. At the junction, bear right, heading for a large campsite. If you’re planning on camping while doing this loop, this is your first option to set up your tent. It’s a large site with room for about eight to ten tents, depending on the size of your group. Creek access is available for water, as well.Cross a wooden footbridge over a creek, and continue up a small incline. A sign posted on your left indicates the Loowit Trail is 1.75 miles away. That’s your next trail junction. Ascend continuously from the campsite through forest with occasional views into the eerily silent Sheep Canyon. As you approach the junction, views of the southwest shoulder of St. Helens improve, until you arrive at a ‘T’ junction. Here a sign indicates that the Butte Camp trail is 3 miles away. Turn right and get ready – the most challenging sections of this hike are on the Loowit Trail. You’ll clamber in and out of four lahars of varying depths and difficulties to negotiate. The trail in and out of these is sketchy at best, with cairns marking entrances and exits, loose footing, and sometimes no tread at all. But you have about 0.8 of a mile of hillside traversing on nice tread before your first one. Enjoy views of treed hillsides south, as well as Butte Camp Dome and Goat Mountain to the southwest. The trail begins a sharp descent -- about 400 feet -- after 0.4 miles, paralleling the first lahar you’ll be crossing before arriving at its edge. Descend on the loose rock and scree into the bottom, and look for the cairn on the other side marking the trail. Following these cairns is the best way to navigate through the lahars along this section of trail. When you’re not dipping in and out of these deep canyons, the Loowit Trail is beautifully kept, easy to follow, and offers a gorgeous panorama of the forests south of St. Helens. As you near the Butte Camp trail, Mount Hood appears to the southeast. Be sure to glance up the shoulder of St. Helens now and then – the changing aspects offer a different vantage every half mile or so. When you arrive at Butte Camp Junction, note a discrepancy in signage. The sign at the junction with Sheep Canyon said it was 3 miles to this point, but now the sign pointing back towards Sheep Canyon says it’s 4 miles away. The recommended Green Trails map for this hike puts the mileage on the Loowit Trail at 3.2 miles, so the total distance for this hike accounts for this section as 3.2 miles. From Butte Camp junction, follow the trail downhill (southwest) through open, fragrant forest, with more views of Mount Hood, tall pines, fireweed, and an overlook of the forest below. Shortly after the overlook, the trail re-enters forest, and within a mile of the junction for the Butte Camp trail, arrive at Butte Camp itself. This is another great spot to spend the night if you’re doing the loop as a multi-day. Past Butte Camp, it’s another 1.75 miles to the junction with the Toutle Trail. Leave the blueberry-lined Butte Camp trail and turn right onto the Toutle Trail. This wide path takes you through cool forest and across several creeks. These are a bit shallow, but you may be able to get some water from pools upstream if you need it.

While mudflows and flooding rendered the land close to St. Helens difficult to negotiate even for two-legged hikers, the Blue Horse trail has been cultivated enough that the way is passable and pleasant for both horses and hikers.  Before you reach the mountain and the mudflows, you'll wind through a lodgepole pine forest, along a flat plain near the trailhead on FR 8123. You'll gradually gain elevation to a junction with the Toutle Trail (238) 2.8 miles into the hike. In order to actually see Blue Lake, you'll need to turn left here, and proceed west for 0.2 miles to another junction heading north on Trail 238. Turn onto 238, and in 0.6 miles arrive at Coldspring Creek, the outlet of little Blue Lake(more green than blue). Camping was available at the south end of the lake, before a flood took out much of the viable lakeshore. Now it's good for one or two photo opportunities, though the landscape is a little tricky to navigate. Back on the Blue Horse Trail, you'll hike through a wide-open forest that gradually rises to a crossing of a lahar, gray rock and ash from the outflow caused by the eruption of St. Helens. Seasonal creeks run through the lahar, feeding fireweed and other flora that bloom along the trail, and offering thirsty hikers a place to refill their water bottles. Leaving the lahar, you'll progress through stands of noble fir and cross Blue Creek (audible, but not visible or accessible from the trail) before ending at another junction with the Toutle Trail. From here, many other hikes are possible. Consider doing a long loop by hiking back on the Toutle Trail. If you choose to do this, it'll be 9 miles round trip.To do this, turn left (south) at the junction, and head gently downhill through more forest and some wildflower meadows, passing bushes laden with huckleberries in the fall to an overlook of Blue Lake 1.7 miles from the junction. It's a small glimpse of the little lake, but the color through the trees is quite pretty. After you've gotten your photos, hike a further 0.6 miles and make a left turn onto 238. Then you'll continue another 0.2 miles and arrive back at the crossroads. Turn right, back down 238, and continue another 2.8 miles back to your car."

With a trailhead at 6500 feet, not much sweat needs to be expended to reach Tiffany's rocky and grassy wide-open summit. Centerpiece to the highlands sharing its name, Tiffany hovers over a windswept world of flower-bursting meadows and delicate alpine tundra at the extreme eastern reaches of the Cascades. Once the domain of solitary sheepherders, Tiffany now hosts intrepid hikers and solitude seekers.Beginning at Freezeout Pass, Trail No. 345 takes off up Freezeout Ridge through an open and mature forest of lodgepole and whitebark pine. By late July the trail is lined with lupine, providing a purple pathway to the prominent peak. Arnica, daisies, and groundsell add golden touches.After about 1.5 miles of gentle climbing, forest yields to flower-filled meadows punctuated with patches of krummholz (densely matted trees stunted by wind and snow). Swaying grasses and sedges engulf the dwarfed and contorted clumps of fir and pine. Lift your eyes from the bonsai forests and golden lawns and note Tiffany's summit cone coming into view. The trail skirts beneath it, traversing the mountain's wide-open southern slopes and arriving at a junction at 2.5 miles (elev. 7700 ft). Turn left, following light tread 0.5 mile to reach the heavens.At this lofty altitude, the elements can be extreme, making it quite difficult for plants to survive. But the alpine flora has adapted well, taking refuge behind weather-beaten boulders and in small protective depressions. Particularly striking are clusters of juniper clinging to lichen-encrusted rocks and outcrops. Now, lift your nose up from the ground once more. It's time to take in the horizon-spanning views from Tiffany's airy summit. In every direction an inspiring landscape unfolds. To the north are a panorama of Pasayten peaks, the Loomis country, and British Columbia's Snowy Mountain, and 1000 feet directly below is a little tarn in a stark cirque. Look south over high rolling ridges out toward Loup Loup Pass and the Beaver Meadow country. To the east the Okanogan Highlands bake in the sun. And west, the North Cascades crowd the skyline. It's a pretty big payoff for such a moderate effort."

Stomp through a large mudhole and get ready to switchback up, climbing ladders of roots and rock along the way. There are just enough sections of decent trail to reassure you that you're still on one. Keep a map handy so you don't get sidetracked by deceptive way trails that deadend in a jumble of brush. Once you reach the top of the ridge, you should be able to see Three Fingered Jack, Glacier Peak, and the tip of Mount Baker through the trees. Look over the ridge for a view of Bear Lake below you. The trail straightens out, passing through a couple of large mudholes, where early in the season there may be snow.  Soon you will reach a large tarn, sometimes mistaken for the lake by overeager hikers. It is pretty, but the actual lake is prettier, and larger. Follow the little stream that heads down from the tarn. The trail is still rough and you may find yourself picking your way through the huckleberries or hiking in the stream itself. What a good way to test those waterproof boots! But the lake lies ahead, with some nice lunch rocks waiting. Once arriving at the lake, admire the spires of Mount Pilchuck, and notice how completely different the view from here is, compared to the one normally seen from the west side. There are plenty of places to sit and have a sandwich, but no level places to camp by the lake.WTA Pro Tip: This area is a maze of old logging roads, and signs get shot up frequently and may be illegible. Have your Green Trails map handy to clear up any confusion."

While the trail to its summit may inflict a little pain during its early steep stretches, you soon gain sweeping views from the floor of the valley to the tops of the airy summits of the North Cascades. The trail begins in subalpine forest opening up to the occasional meadow of wildflowers.  The trail follows a broad ridge, so every open space brings with it views to nearby peaks. In two thirds of a mile, you reach a steep section that is mercifully brief – after another two thirds of a mile and 800 vertical feet, attain a more pronounced ridge from which the lookout first comes into sight. From this vantage the lookout seems to tower over the Gardner Range to the south. A mostly level walk through windswept fields takes you to a final short climb. On the last turn before the summit, you’ll pass a massive cairn dedicated to the prior fire lookouts. The summit is dominated, of course, by the lookout itself. While most of its brethren scattered across the state have long been rendered obsolete by observations from the air, it remains a working part of the forest fire detection system. For nineteen straight years, the lookout was staffed full-time during fire season by Bill Austin, who has developed a bit of a cult following as “Lightning Bill.” In 2014, the decision to staff the Leecher Lookout outside of Twisp moved him further down the valley. The Goat Peak lookout is now on call, staffed when approaching storms warrant an extra set of eyes. As you would expect from a peak with a lookout, the views range far and wide. To the south, it looks as if you’re level with Gardner Mountain and North Gardner Mountain (even though they’re more than 1,000 feet taller). To the north, rolling ridges and the occasional sharper peak extend into the Pasayten Wilderness. Off to the southwest, Silver Star Mountain cracks a toothy, glaciated grin, yet another of the North Cascades’ taller peaks. With so many geographic features containing the word “goat” within a stone’s throw of the trail (Goat Peak, Goat Creek, Goat Wall – even the town name of Mazama denotes a kind of goat), you might think time on the summit would be well spent looking for mountain goats; but a search of trip reports by WTA members over the past four years turns up no mention of them. There have supposedly been sporadic reports of goat sightings in and around the climbing routes of the nearby Goat Wall, but a search of reports from climbers also turns up nothing. Joan Burton’s 2006 book on hiking with kids in Western Washington mentions that the population of mountain goats here was, unfortunately, “slaughtered” in the 1920’s. If true, it’s a stunning reminder of the lasting impact such an action can have. On not-so-distant hikes like Blue Lake, mountain goats are common, and yet they still have not returned to this part of the valley, nearly a century later. What Goat Peak lacks in wildlife, however, it makes up for in larches. In fall, it is one of the finest spots for viewing their golden hues. They grow here in several unusually dense groves on the western slopes along the top of the ridge, the first coming just a little over a mile from the trailhead. Between the distant tall peaks and the nearby larches, Goat Peak puts much of what makes the North Cascades so incredible within easy reach. If you’re looking to introduce kids, family or non-hiking friends to the rewards of hiking, it is a supremely good place to visit."

Pugh Ridge sits smack dab in the middle of the North Fork Entiat watershed, a de facto wilderness sans motors and quite a quiet contrast to the Entiat Valley. It's a grueling grunt to the flower gardens and breathtaking belvederes of Pugh, but worth every calorie spent.Consider the first 2.75 miles along the North Fork Entiat River a nice warm-up. The tread is smooth, the grade slight. Only a mere 300 feet of elevation are subdued. Hit the trail and immediately confront Crow Creek. Easy to cross late in the season, in July it's a foot soaker. At 1 mile come to South Pyramid Creek, easily negotiated via a bridge. A short distance beyond, reach the junction with the Pyramid Creek Trail. Admire the vintage signpost.Continue straight through pleasant forest, and at 2.7 miles come to the junction with the Pugh Ridge Trail (elev. 4250 ft). A side path takes off left to a campsite along the river. Take it if your water supply is low. Otherwise, head right and commence climbing. The way is steep and at times rough. Animal tracks are numerous in the soft pumiceous soils. These critters also have to work hard to get to Pugh's open higher elevations.After 1 mile and 1000 vertical feet, the grade thankfully eases and you near a creek-carrying small ravine. After passing through a soggy spring-fed meadow, the way once again steepens. At about 2 miles from the North Fork Entiat, pass a sign proclaiming ""Buddy Camp"" (elev. 5800 ft). No buddy of mine would want to camp there. Pocket meadows begin shortly afterward and the forest thins. At 2.7 miles from the valley, reach the meadow-carpeted ridge crest (elev. 6500 ft).Now on faint to practically nonexistent tread, head west, climbing a couple of hundred more feet to a larch- and whitebark pine-graced knoll. Continue across open meadow along the level ridge crest for another 0.5 mile to the 6783-foot high point. Views! Golden-crowned and aptly named Pyramid Mountain dominates the show. Its Chelan Range neighbors to the west-Cardinal, Emerald, and Saska-are no less impressive. Directly to the west Duncan Hill fills the viewfinder. Beyond are the Entiat Mountains, the Chiwaukums, Nason Ridge, and Mount Stuart.Here, from the center of the North Fork Entiat country you are afforded an unobstructed view of an unmolested drainage. The Forest Service used to allow it to be ravaged by motorcycles. Public outcry changed that. More public comment is needed to put this wild watershed into wilderness-where it belongs."

Take in the wide silver ribbon of the Columbia River and the rounded shoulders of the mountains around you. Closer in, take a look around your feet for wildflowers, and keep looking as you continue hiking. The flower show intensifies as you climb. The path fades in and out of visibility. When in doubt, refer to your map and follow the ridgeline. The route follows the ridge as it goes over several stairsteppy humps. Hike along a flat section, then climb steeply and then come to a little downhill. Repeat. The views continue to improve as the horizon expands. At every step, you'll enjoy 360 degree views and near total solitude. Be sure to bring plenty of water and sunscreen, since this is a dry route and very exposed, with only two trees about halfway up the route that provide minimal shade. At the top there is a small building and tower that provide some shade. Take another rest; you've just done 3500 feet of elevation gain in 3.6 miles. That's a pretty good workout. Take the long and winding road down the hill, traversing at first and then dropping into the canyon and crossing a creek that runs across the road.

Fern Lake makes a good first night objective, although the 1.5-mile hike up from the river valley bottom is stout. There is no bridge over the river here. Retrace your steps with a steep descent to catch the original trail, and continue upstream to the meadows below Cardinal Peak, which requires careful footing on a mile or more of very steep and loose trail.

Duncan Hill is off the radar screens of many recreationists. The trail, however, is in excellent shape, the tread not too rutted, the way not dusty. It's a long way across a forested ridge to Duncan's lofty summit, but the first half of the hike is fairly easy walking.Start in a solid stand of subalpine fir and lodgepole pine, the kind of high-country forest that grouse, lynx, and snowshoe hare favor. Skirt a knoll and climb another (elev. 5580 ft). Then begin a long descent to a grassy saddle (elev. 5400 ft). Start climbing again-gently-coming to a knoll (elev. 5800 ft) with a view out over the North Fork Entiat River valley at 2.4 miles.Continue for another easy mile, emerging from forest to a pretty little meadow with Duncan's summit peeking above. Gentle going continues, with the trail entering a cool spruce forest before crossing Duncan Creek (elev. 6200 ft), a reliable water source at 3.9 miles. The way now gets tougher as elevation gain becomes the objective. At 5 miles reach a flower-bursting, meadow-draped shoulder as Duncan's summit looms closer.The way turns steeper-and more interesting. Crest a ridge (elev. 7200 ft) that cradles a larch-lined basin. Then skirt beneath the summit block, traversing Duncan's wide-open and steep western slopes. Enjoy breathtaking views to Garland, Fifth of July, and the Ramparts across the valley.

Turn right instead, and after an exhila-rating 0.5 mile across fields of granite till and pumice, through rock gardens and krummholz, reach the 7819-foot summit of Duncan Hill. There was once a fire lookout here, and now there's a solar-powered radio tower-and did I mention the unsurpassed views? To the west Glacier Peak rises above the glacier fields of Buck and Clark.

About 0.5 mile up the trail you'll cross a small creek and then start climbing with vigor. Within the next 0.5 mile the trail turns even steeper, leaving the last big section of forest just over 1 mile from the trailhead. Now you enter steep hillside meadows. The views, too, open up here. Look across the Cle Elum Valley to see Cathedral Rock towering over the opposite valley wall.Enjoy those views--they get progressively better--for the next mile. At 2.5 miles the trail splits. Both paths go to the pass. Take either, then come back on the other. For what it's worth, the left fork is a more direct route--I prefer it on the downhill return. So, go right to swing out past an old hard-rock mine (Gold? Silver? Not much of either was ever found here) and a small creek. The trails merge for the final 0.25 mile to the pass.Paddy-Go-Easy Pass (elev. 6100 ft) is nestled below the 400-foot red-rock cliffs of an unnamed peak."

It could even be their first hike! The trail is solidly-constructed, with good footing, no mud and it's almost all level. It's designed with the young visitors in mind. But hey, it's OK if you older folks enjoy it, too!Start out from the main parking lot, pass the bulletin boards and the convenient toilets, and then note the small trail sign directing you to the right to find the Swamp Trail. You will come to the actual beginning of the trail in about 100 yards where a big sign greets you (see photo).Additional signs along the way tell the story of Zoe's visit there, and her encounters with various wetland critters (Zoe might herself be a critter...) and their uneasiness about a possibly-mythical Swamp Monster. A brochure often is available at the trailhead, and it offers supplementary material for accompanying adults to enhance the visit. The surroundings are very green, with lots of moss and ferns but you won't see much standing water and definitely no alligators! If you're just out for a short walk, then hike the Swamp Trail a half mile and, when it meets the Gas Line and a Power Line, turn around there. By then you will have read all of Zoe's story, so you can just head back to your trailhead.Extending Your HikeOf course, if time and your little hiker's enthusiasm allow, there are a number of possible extensions. You might consult the Green Trails Map (204S) for possibilities before you start out. There's one posted on the bulletin board at the main trailhead. Better yet, take along a copy of your own so you can improvise along the way.Here's one suggested extension you might particularly enjoy. It offers a variety of attractions: one of the largest trees still standing in the Tigers, a really wet swampy area, tiny Round Lake, the remains of an old bus and views of larger Tradition Lake. In fact, you will be hiking our Tradition Lake Loop, but you will be hiking it in the reverse direction. No worries, that works fine too!Here's a brief summary, and you can consult the Tradition Lake Loop entry in our WTA Hiking Guide for more detail. When the Swamp Trail meets the power line, just keep going. The trail changes names to Big Tree Trail and it will take you by the big tree (you can't miss it). Just past the tree, be sure to take the very short--just a few feet--side trail to the right to see some of the best swamp you will find in the Tigers. Then continue on. The Big Tree Trail soon joins the Brink Trail and you will head left there. The ongoing trail crosses under a powerline, passes the sign for the Adventure Trail, then heads left, going slightly uphill for about 0.1 mile. There you will turn right onto the Wetlands Trail (sorry, no sign there, but it will be obvious.) In 0.2 mile stay right and avoid the Wetlands Connector (it goes to a power substation) and soon pass tiny Round Lake. When you come to another power line, go right 200 feet, then left onto the Bus Trail. In 0.3 miles see what's left of the bus on your left. Then backtrack about 100 feet and take the trail heading north. It will take you to the Around the Lake Trail. Turn right there, and enjoy views down on Tradition Lake as you head back toward the main trailhead. Along the way, note the in-ground displays that show what some animal tracks look like.Whew! That sounds like a lot when it's all crammed into a few brief sentences like that. The Tradition Lake Loop write-up offers a more pedestrian exposition. But it's all on good trail, with a total distance of 2.9 miles and a cumulative elevation gain of only about 150 feet. If your young hiker seems up to it--and assuming you are too--you should go for it.Along the way, try to identify any wildflowers you see, and point out different kinds of trees--particularly their bark, and their needles or leaves, and how different they all are. You'll undoubtedly hear the calls of a few wild birds, and perhaps be able to identify some of them. And by the time you are done, if you are lucky, you might meet up with one of those friendly critters that Zoe encountered on her hike, way back there along the Swamp Trail."

The first seven miles of the trail follows the Flapjack Lakes Trail, wandering past Donahue Creek Falls and next to the gorgeous Flapjack lakes. While awesome, press on past the lakes and keep heading up toward Gladys Divide.The trail to Gladys Divide is three miles long, but feels much shorter, thanks to impressive views of the ridiculously craggy Olympic Mountains. Passing near the Olympic’s Sawtooth Mountains, the trail gains elevation, skirting a ridge, eventually capping off at the divide, overlooking the start of the Hamma Hamma River.Take in this view before exploring a small path to your right, which gets you to the top of Mount Gladys and world class views of the entire Olympic Peninsula."

It's also worth noting that the single most spectacular backcountry toilet in the state is found here. Rather, the toilet itself is nothing fancy--just a lidded box, really--but the views from this ""throne"" include the whole of the wildflower meadows, the cascades tumbling down the cliffs at the head of the basin, and the crown of Mount Rainier above it all.The trail, a section of the Wonderland, leaves Box Canyon and provides a nice warm-up over the first mile, climbing only a few hundred feet to reach Nickel Creek Camp. Here, though, the trail gets serious about its climbing. You ascend steeply for the next 2 miles to reach the crest of the Cowlitz Divide ridgeline and a junction with the Olallie Creek trail. Stay left and follow the ridge crest north as it climbs toward Mount Rainier. For nearly 4 miles you follow this ridgeline, staying atop the crest as it rolls through forests and broad meadows. You'll find glorious views of Mount Rainier at times, as well as looks east across the Ohanapecosh Valley to Double Peak and Shriner Peak.At about 6.5 miles, the trail climbs above timberline and crosses an area of rock and permanent snowfield on the flank of Cowlitz Park before a final 800-foot descent into the basin of Indian Bar. The Ohanapecosh River flows through the heart of this meadow, and you can see this remarkable river being born out of the waterfalls tumbling down the rocky walls surrounding the basin. As you walk into the basin, you pass the pretty cascade of Wauhaukaupauken Falls before reaching the impressive stone shelter at the group site in the heart of the meadow (7.5 miles from the trailhead).

If you can get past its quiet shores, it's a short jaunt to connect with the Craggy Peak trail and miles of ridgeline hiking that the Dark Divide Roadless Area affords. From the trailhead at the end of Road 9331, descend into open forest. Tall trees tower over you--noble fir, grand fir, and Doug-fir lend their scent to the air. The rolling trail guides you through two large meadows. These green oases are bursting with lupine and avalanche lilies once the snow melts out, but note that snow sticks around late in the season here, and these areas can be boggy when wet. After passing through two meadows, the trail rises up only to make a final plunge down to Blue Lake. That's right--only a mile into your hike and you're already at your destination! Blue Lake is visible from the small hill you climb out of the meadow, but a trail winds around and plops you right on the edge of its gorgeous, blue-green waters. This is a great spot for families who want to fish, camp, or simply do a short dayhike. But the trail continues. If you feel like further exploration, push on past the lake. The trail continues to roll, but with more elevation gain and loss, before crossing a babbling creek at the mile and a half mark, and then popping out into a wide wildflower meadow. Bees buzz here (and other bugs--bring your spray). A small seasonal stream wends its way through the meadow, and at the north edge is a small camp, Basin Camp. The only trick here is the trail. It vanishes. To continue on, follow the white diamond markers across the meadow, where the trail picks up again. It's quite rutted here from spring runoff, but past the steep incline to get out of the meadow, the trail improves and you'll arrive at the Craggy Peak trail in a little more than half a mile. From here, you can hike either way along the Craggy Peak Trail. To the left leads back to the Craggy Peak trailhead in about 5 miles. A right turn takes you deeper into the Dark Divide, towards views of Mount Adams and St Helens, as well as Craggy Peak."

Sure, it follows the creek upstream, but it doesn't exactly parallel it. This path weaves in and out of side canyons and up and down small rises and ridges, always working upstream, but seldom coming very close to the waters of Quartz Creek. When it does dip down and access the creek, however, the views are stunning. The creek is a rugged, swift mountain river teeming with trout. Several good campsites are easily accessible, many of them near the shores of the creek, and the scenery near and away from the river is spectacular. The side canyons and ravines are often cut down the middle by rushing tributary creeks that thunder through narrow slots and bound over steep drops. The forest that shades the entire route is dominated by deep, old groves of Douglas-fir and western red cedar, and the high, shimmering cliff walls of Quartz Canyon are beautiful. The trail rolls up and down as it meanders up the Quartz Creek valley for several miles. The first mile actually makes use of an ancient miner's road, though nature has reclaimed most of the old roadbed, leaving just a single track to follow.  You might still find a few rusty hulks along the path, though-the last dingy remains of miners' broken dreams. The trail crosses Platinum Creek at about 0.75 mile. No bridge exists, so you'll need to ford the creek. This is generally easily accomplished unless the creek is swollen with snowmelt early in the year. As with all river crossings, use extreme caution.At 2 miles, the trail brings you to the second river crossing, though this time there is (usually) a stable footlog to bridge Straight Creek. The forest adjoining Straight Creek is mostly old second-growth, but it's grown up nicely. Just across the creek, you'll find the first of the fine campsites that dot this route. Push on another 2 miles, passing yet another old (1970s-era) clear-cut full of young trees and then more ancient forest. You'll find the third creek crossing, at Snagtooth Creek, 4 miles out.

You'll switchback through a long series of tight turns for that first mile, and then suddenly crest out on the ridge top. Fortunately, during the initial climb, the surrounding forest is thick and shady, which keeps hikers from baking in the hot summer sun. There are even a few huckleberries along the route to provide nourishment. At the ridge top the walking is easy, and the views are spectacular.

You can see the place where men and women stood guard to try to protect the forests from fire, and you can see the effects of fire that wasn't contained. This route gets few visitors and as such offers a remarkable degree of solitude, but that lack of attention also means the trail is falling into disrepair. The route gets a bit brushy in places, and as it crests the open ridgeline below the summit, the path is very rough and hard to follow at times.This is largely an open, sunlit trail thanks to an old forest fire that leveled much of the forest canopy and created a series of new wildflower meadows and deer-filled clearings. The forest is returning, but the timber is sparse still, leaving lots of sun-dappled terrain to explore.The trail angles upward from the trailhead, riding switchbacks through the fire zone. After passing the old burn sites in the first 2 miles, the route loops north around the head of a small basin (a seasonal spring seeps out of the hillside above the trail, but generally not enough to be a stable water source). Once on the ridgetop, the trail angles south once more, climbing moderately for 0.6 mile, then very steeply through a tight series of switchbacks to top out at the 5980-foot South Point summit, just 3.5 miles after leaving the trailhead.Look for remains of the old lookout tower that stood here during the middle of this century. The adventurous hiker can scramble along an old trail (no longer maintained) that rides the crest of the South Point Ridge south for a few miles. There is no reliable source of drinking water along the entire trail, so be sure to carry all you need."

After just a half mile of hiking, cross under the westbound lanes of I-90. Architects built the freeway here in the hopes of avoiding avalanches and rockslides. Now, if there are any rumblings from the peaks above, rocks or snow course beneath the interstate, rather than piling up on top of it.Continue past I-90 and the traffic sounds fade away into forest noises and those of your fellow hikers. Just over one mile from the trailhead, arrive at the waterslide and look for strategically placed rocks for a dry crossing. In times of high water, Denny Creek can be dangerous, so if it’s running high, save this trip for later in the season. Once past the waterslide, your hike changes character. What was an easy forest ramble becomes an uphill grind, as you switchback over exposed hillsides. Luckily, two waterfalls across the ravine offer photo (and rest) opportunities. The hike comes to a saddle. Contrasting with the hillside you just came up, this area is velvety green with underbrush and lush forest thanks to Denny Creek, which you now hike alongside. After three-quarters of a mile of switchbacking, the green fades away, and you’re back on exposed trail. The granite rocks here hold heat well, so in the midday this can be quite hot. Start hiking early to avoid slogging through this area in the heat of the day. Begin to switchback up to a small saddle—Hemlock Pass. At 4700 feet, this is the highest point of the hike, but the views will come in a third of a mile and 200 feet lower, when you arrive at Melakwa Lake. This glittering jewel of a mountain lake is set in a granite basin, a diamond ringed by Bryant, Chair, and Kaleetan Peaks. This makes a great first-night camp, though it is a popular destination. Again, an early start means you’re more likely to snag the spot you want at Melakwa. If you want a slightly different scene, look for a good spot at Upper Melakwa Lake. On day two, head for Lower Tuscohatchie Lake. Return to the main trail, but instead of going back the way you came, take the trail heading downhill. It’s a 2.9 mile downhill hike to quiet Lower Tuscohatchie Lake through second-growth forests. This part of the trail is less-frequently visited, so you may have it to yourself. Lower Tuscohatchie doesn’t have many campsites; if you can’t find a free one, it’s only another half mile to Pratt Lake, which usually has more to pick from. Either way, be sure to stop at Lower Tuscohatchie, and as you hike, take in the green hills of the Middle Fork valley rolling out to the north. This is a view that few hikers see, since most day hikers don’t pass Melakwa or Pratt Lake.From Pratt Lake, traverse the east side of the lake, moving from underbrush to a talus slope. If Melakwa’s shimmering evoked diamonds, then Pratt's evokes a large sapphire. Its deep blue waters contrast well with the gleaming granite surrounding it—be sure and snap a photo or two. Leaving the talus, begin switchbacking up through forest and 1.4 miles from the campground at Pratt Lake arrive at a trail junction. Turn left. You’re on your last leg of the trip, 4.3 miles from the Pratt Lake trailhead. The trail traverses through open forest with one particularly notable viewpoint of Mount Rainier and Ollalie Lake, before gradually descending to the Pratt Lake Trailhead.WTA Pro Tip: If you want another day or two in the backcountry, try taking the side trip to Kaleetan Lake, nestled at the base of Kaleetan Peak. 4.9 miles from Lower Tuscohatchie Lake, this trail is infrequently visited and you may be lucky enough to have a campsite all to yourself."

The trail is an excellent day hike and a good place to spend the night, especially if you plan to hike the entire trail, which leads to Stuart Pass (16 miles one way) and beyond. There are many excellent sites for resting or camping beside the creek--but you'll have to wait until the snow melts before attempting to reach higher elevations via this trail. There is a gravel bar at Falls Creek and a log that tempts crossing. This can be extremely dangerous during high runoff in springtime, and should be forded only during the summer months.

Please keep in mind there are no lifeguards on duty anywhere along this trail. There is also a picnic shelter and playground with a generously large grassy area for kids to get out their wiggles. Don’t let your little ones get too distracted--the bigger playground is at the end of your trail.Follow the paved path toward the lake and past the docks. It will soon take you between the lake and the restaurant Emory’s. As you round Emory’s, you'll see that the trail splits at the first of many interpretative signs. Head left, following the paved path along the shoreline passing picnic tables and piers giving you good views of the lake. It comes close to the road a couple times, so make sure to have a close eye or hand on any small children. Around half a mile keep a look out for a dirt trail on the left of the sidewalk and take it. This will lead you down into the Green Lantern Park and off the sidewalk for a little bit. With no amenities here, see how many different kinds of birds you can spot. Many have been seen frolicking around the lake, including the mallard, Double-Crested Cormorant, bufflehead, common merganser, Canada goose, american widgeon, american coot and bald eagle, to name a few. This dirt path will do a small loop and take you back up to the sidewalk where you will want to head left again.Follow the sidewalk past more picnic tables, piers and interpretative signs. Try to ignore the sounds of the cars rushing by, it will quiet down soon. At 0.8 miles, after a right turn in the sidewalk you will find yourself at Silver Lake Road. Go left here and follow this road through a small neighborhood. Although the road is not often busy, there is no sidewalk so use caution. After a third of a mile the road starts to veer right, look for a dirt trail going left away from the road. This is your trail.The trail will run between a chain link fence and a park and ride, leading you to the entrance of Thornton A. Sullivan Park and your destination. This park is much larger than the Hauge Homestead Park and is complete with, docks, restrooms, picnic tables, outdoor table tennis table, large playground, sandy beach, nine hole disc golf course and more trails. WTA Pro Tip: With a little something for everyone, this trail is a great option for an in-city outing to enjoy the outdoors. Bring a lunch and a floaty on a hot summer day, but remember that there are no lifeguards on duty."

Appreciate the tall deciduous trees and some large conifers, plus ferns and small creeks. In season, look for forest wildflowers. Try to identify some of the wild birds, and enjoy the antics of the squirrels that always are present. These trails offer one of several short forest hikes available in the Bellevue-Redmond urban area. Beginning in Bellevue's Tam O'Shanter Park, you will continue north on a trail that crosses the city boundary into Redmond's adjoining Viewpoint Open Space Park (Not to be confused with Redmond's similarly-named Viewpoint Neighborhood Park farther east, or with Bellevue's Viewpoint Park farther west, overlooking I-520. All three of these ""Viewpoint"" parks have NE 24th St as one of their boundaries!) From the parking area along 173rd Ave NE, next to Tam O'Shanter Park, hike past the southern edge of the small playground and continue on past the manicured lawn area. At the first large, square trail post turn right and head gently downhill, passing large deciduous trees and a few conifers. This trail, like all trails in both parks, is surfaced with bark and wood chips, offering a soft footing for hikers and joggers.At the next square trail post, turn left (the right fork leads out of the park to a trailhead at the end of NE 16th St.) Continue north, back uphill, regaining part of the elevation you lost minutes earlier. In the spring, a lot of buttercups bloom along sunny areas of the trail here, and you will see more in other spots farther along. Horsetail also is common here. You will notice a few invasive plants along your route too, particularly ivy and Himalayan blackberry. In summer, you might eat a few of the ripe blackberries to prevent them from seeding more of their ilk in the park.The next trail post is at a four-way trail junction. Turn right there. Going straight ahead would lead you out of the park to a trailhead on NE 17th Pl, while turning left would lead you back toward your trailhead -- you might elect to go that way on your return. Your ongoing trail heads north another half mile, with gentle ups and downs. Along the way it crosses over into Redmond's Viewpoint Open Space Park (there is no obvious viewpoint, and it is open only in the sense of being forest rather than housing.) In season, you might note a few more wildflowers such as fringe cup, mimulus, avens and salmonberry. You are likely to see squirrels, and sometimes a bunny might appear for you. You often will hear woodpeckers, crows, robins and other birds. The route continues on north, crossing three small creeks on sturdy wooden bridges. In summer these streams might only be trickles, or might even be dry. All too soon the trail reaches its northern end at NE 24th St, about 0.65 miles from your trailhead. (As with nearby Ardmore Park, some online references get the trail distance totally wrong, suggesting incorrectly that it is as much as five miles!) Even if you explore some of the side trails in Tam O'Shanter Park, your total round trip distance will be less than a mile and a half. And it's a very pleasant forest walk.Note: While Tam O'Shanter is a small park, you might find it helpful to download a park trail map from www.bellevuewa.gov/oshanter_trail.htm. This takes two steps: On the right of the illustration, click the link for ""Tam O'Shanter Park trails page,"" and click the link there for ""Detailed map of Tam O'Shanter Park Trails,"" NOT the link for ""Map / Directions.""

Here, you can enjoy tall conifers and deciduous trees, ferns and other forest vegetation, and small creeks, giving the illusion that you are some distance away from the surrounding suburbia. You are likely to find a few wildflowers blooming in season, hear woodpeckers, crows and other birds, and see a few energetic squirrels.You will notice an occasional stump in the park; the area was logged many years ago. But today the forest has recovered and there are many large second-growth trees, and forest wildflowers in season. In late winter and early spring, look for an occasional trillium. In late spring, buttercups are numerous along sunnier edges of the trails, and you are likely to see avens, miner's lettuce, fringe cup, nettles, salal, salmonberry and thimbleberry. A few invasive plants are present too, particularly some Himalayan blackberry, and occasionally ivy and holly.Note that you have some options in the northern section of the park, and you might enjoy exploring by varying your return route, but be sure and bring a map. The southern section of the park is easier to navigate, as it features one single, long trail.All trails in the park are surfaced with bark and wood chips, offering a soft footing for hikers and joggers. Occasional short, steep sections are traversed using carefully crafted wooden stairs.The hike begins near a grassy area next to a small playground, with tall conifers looming up immediately to the south. Signed trails leave from both sides of the playground and come together in 0.1 mile.Take the trail that begins on the west side of the playground and head toward the tall trees. Just beyond the point where the two trails rejoin, come to a low bridge crossing a moist area that may be dry in summer. At a trail fork just beyond the bridge, head left (the right fork leads out to NE 28th St and another park trailhead.) The left fork soon wanders out of the northern section of the park onto an apparent continuation of NE 28th St -- but it's a segment that is unpaved, grassy and not used by cars. The trail continues east along the grassy strip for just a short distance before heading back north into the park.At the next trail junction in the park, turn right. The ongoing tail crosses that grassy continuation of NE 28th St and heads into the southern section of the park. You will cross two small streams on low bridges and, near the second crossing, note a short side trail that leads down to a view of the confluence of two small creeks. It's possible to scramble down a rough bank to reach the stream bed for a closer look. Like all creeks in the park, these are small. In summer they might not be much more than trickles, or could even be dry.Continue south on the main trail and soon reach the southern end of the park at NE 24th street, where you can turn around and head back to your trailhead. The entire distance from the northern to the southern end of the park is about 0.6 miles. Signposts in the park show the correct mileages. (But a few of the many online pages that mention Ardmore Park get the distance totally wrong, suggesting incorrectly that it is as much as five miles!) Even if you explore the side trails at the northern end of the park, your round trip distance will be at most an easy mile and a half.

Big trees finally appear (I told you it gets better). Despite light use, the trail is in remarkable shape, thanks in large part to the tireless work of the Washington Trails Association. But while only a handful of hikers trek up this valley each year, the elk that pass through are legion. Keep your eyes out for these elegant beasties.Ancient giants dwarf you as you continue up the trail. Except for the river's soothing churn and sweet serenades from resident wrens, the primeval forest is quiet. Lichens drape overhead. Fern boughs burst open from the forest floor. Dew-dripping moss clings to everything. Only the glaucous sheen of alder bark breaks the deep green of the rain forest.After 6 miles of peaceful passage, you'll come to a junction with the Rugged Ridge Trail and a most inviting riverside camping area. This is a good spot to turn around, or if inclined, spend the night. During low water flows, venture out onto the gravel banks of the river. During downpours admire the torrents from the elevated embankment."

Follow a short, steep trail to connect with the Tiger Mountain Trail (TMT.) Return via the TMT and  on the way, look in on the site of a 1925 logging train wreck. Begin your hike at the Tiger Summit Trailhead off Highway 18. The Iverson Railroad Trail begins next to the signboard and heads west, climbing 200 feet or so before leveling off. It's a nice forest walk, mostly along the old railroad grade, with a lot of ferns and second-growth trees. In late winter and early spring be alert for the first wildflowers, usually coltsfoot, yellow violets and trilliums.After 1.5 miles, the Iverson Trail drops a bit and joins the West Side Road (Road 1000,) a gated road used by technicians servicing electronic gear and occasionally, by logging trucks. Continue west along the road. In 0.3 miles note the sign for a trail crossing where the main Tiger Mountain Trail (TMT) arrives, road-like, from the south and continues on trail-like toward the north. The TMT will provide your return route. For now, continue on Road 1000 an additional 1.6 miles, first climbing a hundred feet, then dropping four hundred feet with some switchbacks before coming to a creek crossing. Formerly it was just a large culvert, but it's been replaced by a heavy-duty concrete-deck bridge.Just upstream of the bridge, look for a signpost where a small metal sign proclaims ""Middle Tiger Trail."" At the top of the signpost, above the metal sign, the original wooden sign is still readable, as of 2015. It's one of the most weathered signs in the Tigers, and it acknowledges that the trail also leads to the Hobart - Middle Tiger RR Grade.Head up the Middle Tiger Trail and, in 0.1 mile, come to a trail fork where a not-quite-so-weathered sign will direct you to the left fork for the Hobart - Middle Tiger RR Grade. The sign also notes that it's 1.4 miles to the site of a ""curved trestle,"" and in the early days of logging an elaborate wooden trestle did cross the creek there. Unfortunately, nothing remains of the trestle today.The RR grade continues gently uphill. After a rain, tall grasses bordering the trail can make for a damp passage. And low salmonberry bushes may feel prickly to hikers wearing shorts. After a mile or so you will begin to hear the sounds of Fifteenmile Creek down below. About 1.7 miles from the West Side Road, note a connecting trail heading uphill to the east. A small sign with an arrow pointing straight up proclaims ""TMT 1/4."" But first, continue on the RR Grade another 0.1 mile, where the trail comes down to Fifteenmile Creek. It's a pleasant, seemingly-remote setting; a good stopping place for a snack, and you might have the creekside all to yourself. A faint ongoing trail continues on across the creek, heading up toward the 15 Mile RR Grade. That route hasn't made it onto the Green Trails Map yet, but if you have a GPS unit and use the NW Topo map it is shown there. You might keep that ongoing route in mind for a future exploration.When you are ready to continue with today's loop, backtrack that 0.1 mile and head up the connecting trail toward the TMT. It is steep, but the vertical-pointing arrow is a considerable exaggeration. You soon will  find yourself on the TMT, just north of Hal's Cove.Head south on the TMT, passing other named sites (Denny's Bulge, Joe's Hollow, etc,) each commemorating one of the volunteers who built the TMT in the 1970s. At Millan's Crossing the TMT crosses over the Middle Tiger Trail, here 900 feet higher than where your route left it earlier today. Stay on the TMT.As you approach Karl's Gap you will skirt the edge of a clear-cut area. If clouds permit, you may have a brief view of Mount Rainier in the distance. The TMT leaves the clear-cut and traverses around the north, west, and south sides of Karl's Peak, then enters the clear-cut area again and descends to a sharp corner at Zeig's Zag.At the Zag, a bit of muddy side trail crosses a seep and seems to continue on straight ahead. It's worth a five-minute look. In a few feet, a sign proclaims ""Artifacts Trail,"" and in 200 feet it leads to the site of a February 23, 1925, wreck of a logging train. An official-looking sign there identifies the site and lists the historic date.Most of the wreckage was salvaged at the time, and only a few pieces remain. A set of wheels peers out from beneath a downed tree, and other objects are strewn around. A few feet beyond the wheels, a jumble of metal pieces suggests an abstract metal sculpture. The Artifacts Trail hasn't made it onto the Green Trails Map yet but, once again, if you have a GPS unit and use the NW Topo map it is shown there. The ongoing Artifacts Trail offers no additional train wreckage and it has many blowdowns, so it's best to turn around here, return to the TMT and continue on south.Soon, you will reach the West Side Road, thus completing the loop part of your hike. From there, return to the Tiger Summit Trailhead the way you came, via the road and the Iverson Railroad Trail.A Possible VariationAs described above, your hike can begin at the Tiger Summit Trailhead. Alternatively, you could begin at the south end of the TMT along Tiger Mountain Rd SE, although that would add 3.5 miles to your round-trip distance and require an additional 900 feet of elevation gain. From that trailhead, you could follow the TMT all the way to the West Side Road, or could use the South Tiger Traverse for part of the way (or you could go via one route and return via the other.) If these options sound interesting, refer to the Hiking Guide description for the South Tiger Loop for details."

This is a perfect destination in spring, when the high country is still buried in snow, but wildflowers are blooming like mad along this trail.Good news and bad. First the bad: the Forest Service has stopped maintaining this trail. Now the good news: while this trail is officially open to dirt bikers, only a crazed one would now dare ride on it because of the numerous large blowdowns. More bad news: no maintenance also means that the trail is brushing in fast, and big blowdowns are also a hindrance to hikers. Possible good news: if hikers, horseback riders, mountain bikers, and yes, even motorcyclists could forge a partnership to keep this wonderful low-country trail open. It would be a great way to open dialogue between all of these different trail users too.Begin in a nice grove of big ponderosa pine. Immediately meet up with the river and follow it upstream through a narrow canyon littered with big boulders. The tread is wide and lined with horsetails. Surrounding slopes and ledges are warmed by the sun, while a constant breeze cooled by the river's tumbling waters blows along the canyon floor. At 0.5 mile enter an old burn zone. Smatterings of ancient ponderosas-their bark resilient to scorching-stand defiantly along the frothing river.Continue through the winding canyon. Willows and other brush grow thicker along the tread. Without maintenance soon, this trail will become impassable. At 1.5 miles Hornet Creek buzzes down into the river from the west. A long-abandoned trail (extremely difficult to follow), reached by fording the river, follows the creek westward along a parallel ridge. In springtime, look along the sun-kissed slopes here for Tweedy's lewisia, a showy flower endemic only to the Wenatchee Mountains, the Methow Valley, and British Columbia's Simalkameen Valley. Look too for rubber boas, a docile constrictor snake that is common in these parts.Continue farther, passing nice lunch spots by mesmerizing rapids and in tranquil forest groves. At 2.7 miles come to a nice series of rapids that careen over granite ledges and boulders. In another 0.5 mile, reach a draw that may or may not contain running water.

Keep left, following the Palisades Trail #1198 up a set of switchbacks that parallel the steep canyon along Dalles Creek through forest.Listen for Lower Dalles Falls, one mile from the trailhead. Take a side trail to the right for a closer look. This is a snow-driven creek, and in the mid summer it is just a trickle. Late spring and early summer are the best time to visit. Push past the falls, up the wooden staircase and continue to switchback uphill. Cross two creeks on wooden bridges at 1.2 and 1.4 miles from the trailhead, respectively, until the trail becomes a gentle climb. At 1.7 mils, reach the first viewpoint along the trail. With good weather you will see Sun Top Mountain and Skookum Falls (another snow-driven waterfall) across the White River Valley.Continue on, hiking through old-growth forest and climbing 1.3 miles to the next viewpoint--North Snoquera Point. From here, the views are impressive: Mount Rainier and Sun Top Mountain rise above the valley. Moving on, follow the trail through a section of young forest and drop down, crossing Snoquera Creek on two wooden bridges.

As you come down, approach (via switchback) and then parallel Ranger Creek, dropping 2500 feet in 4.8 miles. The last leg of your loop is a knee-saving traverse. At the junction with Trail 1199, turn right and hike about 3.3 miles along the valley bottom. Arrive at a junction. This is for the Snoquera Falls Trail--a 2.4 mile trail that parallels the one you're currently hiking on. Continue along for another mile and pass through an intersection with the Snoquera Falls trail (which runs east/west) and continue a further 0.8 miles to your last junction, where you turn left and make the short descent back to your car. WTA Pro Tip: If your knees can take it, add in a side trip to Snoquera Falls at the end of this loop. It offers an excellent close-up view of a waterfall and adds on 2.4 miles, making a nearly 16 mile loop more than 18, and offering the full spectrum of what this part of Washington has to offer."

Cross over High Point Creek and, where the pavement ends, find the signed beginning of the High Point Trail. The trail loops around tiny High Point Pond and heads south, gaining about 200 feet in 0.3 miles before reaching a power line.A sign here indicates ""Lingering Trail,"" with a single arrow pointing south along your route. You're still on the High Point Trail. The sign is there because this is the former location of a junction with the lower end of the Lingering Trail. That trail has been rerouted, and you now will pass the junction 100 yards south of the power line. (The Lingering Trail is an option for your return hike.)Continue south on the High Point Trail, passing a junction with Dwight's Way. About 0.8 miles from the powerline--and up 500 feet--merge with the main Tiger Mountain Trail (TMT) at a signed junction.

Be sure to stay on the TMT, as it takes a sharp right turn here.Climb about 400 feet and, in a half mile, reach Ruth's Cove. In spring, be alert for coltsfoot, trilliums, yellow violets and other wildflowers here. Ruth's Cove is a pleasant spot where a relatively new small bridge crosses a tributary of High Point Creek. Skunk cabbage also blooms along the creek here in spring.Continue on another 0.4 miles, climbing about 200 feet, to reach Fred's Corner, a signed trail junction in an area of tall maples. While you are there, look up in the trees. It's not unusual to see a few wild pigeons - very different birds from their urban, street-smart cousins. The trail forks here, with the West Tiger RR Grade heading left and the TMT going right. Leave the TMT and continue left on the W. Tiger RR Grade. Climb steeply and, in 0.4 miles, reach a signed junction with the Preston Trail (formerly the ""West Tiger No. 1 Trail,"" a name your map may still use.) Turn right on the Preston Trail and climb steadily, gaining about 600 feet in a half-mile, to reach a junction with the Bootleg Trail.The ongoing Preston Trail continues on west below the ridge top. In 2014, the slope above the trail was clear-cut. Trees at the edge of the trail now are subject to the full force of storm winds, and there have been some blowdowns.As of winter 2015, part of the Preston Trail was completely blocked by a massive blowdown. Check recent trip reports for the current status.In less than a quarter-mile, come to a signed junction with the Poo Top Trail. Here, to reach the summit of W. Tiger No. 1 (or as close as an electronics tower will allow) you need to take a short side trip. Hike up the Poo Top Trail, gaining about 75 feet on four short switchbacks to reach a high point next to a large granite boulder. At 2948 feet, this is the second highest summit in the Tigers (only East Tiger, at 3004 feet, is higher.) It may seem somewhat anti-climactic, both because of the adjoining tower, and because there is no view. But don't despair! You soon will have your view. The Poo Top Trail continues on south to meet up with the TMT and the Hidden Forest Trail. But that's for a different hike! For today, turn around and take the Poo Top Trail back down to the Preston Trail (from this side the sign says it's the Bypass Trail, because it bypasses the electronics.) Turn left and continue west on the Preston/Bypass Trail a quarter mile. Pass through some very dark forest and emerge abruptly into the bright sun (clouds permitting) at the Hiker's Hut Viewpoint.The hut itself is a small, round metal structure that might serve as a very basic storm shelter in winter. A graveled service road arrives here from the west to reach the electronics gear, and a bench is available across the road. Sit and take in the view. On a clear day, Mount Rainier will be directly in front of you and of a large swath of the Olympics will be visible to your right.While you are at the viewpoint, you may be visited by a few grey jays hoping to beg a sample of your lunch, but be sure not to feed them. Humming birds also often are seen here and, in summer, large dragonflies. In spring, check the surroundings for wildflowers such as lupine and tiger lily--a few years ago tiger lilies bloomed right under the bench!When you have had your fill of the view, and finished your lunch, it's time to think of returning. Either head back the way you came, possibly taking the optional Lingering Trail, or see below for another possibility.Extending your hikeWith a little additional effort you can include the W. Tiger No. 2 summit in your hike, then see some different trails on your way back down to Fred's Corner to rejoin your ascent route. This option adds a half-mile to your distance, and an additional 250 feet to your total elevation gain.If this sounds appealing, hike down the gritty service road, dropping about 400 feet. Come to a metal gate adorned with crude lettering ""No Trespassing."" That's just meant to discourage unauthorized vehicles. Hikers are welcome to proceed around the right end of the gate on a short trail signed ""W. Tiger No. 2 Trail."" Once you are past the gate, the road again serves as your ongoing trail.Continue on the road, gaining about 250 feet, to reach the West Tiger No. 2 summit. There's not much of a view. A signed trail continues on west 0.4 miles to the ever-popular W. Tiger No. 3 summit. But, unless you are seeking lots of company, or are intent on traversing all three West Tiger summits today, don't go there.Like many Tiger summits, W. Tiger No. 2 has its share of electronics gear. Hike up to the surrounding metal fence and head around the right (east) side, where you will find a sign for the ongoing W. Tiger No. 2 Trail. Descend this short trail, dropping 270 feet, to reach the TMT at Tom's Crossing. It's the highest point on the TMT at about 2,500 feet. It's not actually a crossing, but a T-junction (as in ""crossing the T."")Turn right on the TMT and continue descending on a few switchbacks. When you reach the junction of the TMT and K-3 Trails you will be faced with a three-way trail split. The left fork is the ""unmaintained"" K-3 Trail, the center fork is the former route of the TMT (now just a way to connect with the W. Tiger RR Grade) and, since fall 2014, the right fork is the ongoing TMT (Your map may not show this change.)Continue on the new TMT, descending gently and crossing High Point Creek on a new, very secure bridge. Descend some more and reconnect with the former route of the TMT east of the creek. The ongoing TMT from here initially is fairly level, then it drops steeply to reach Fred's Corner.From Fred's Corner, either return to your trailhead at High Point the way you came or, optionally, when you come to the junction for the Lingering Trail, take it instead. The Lingering Trail passes through some nice forest and crosses Dwight's Way before rejoining the High Point Trail just above the power line."

In the warmer months, try the circumnavigation of Sherman Peak plus the bonus excursion out to picturesque Snow Peak cabin. Plan ahead and rent the cabin, which is reservable for $30 per night for up to six people, year-round. Camping here is hardly roughing it, as the cabin rental comes complete with wood stove, firewood supply, cots, table, propane cook stove, basic cookware, and solar lighting. Bring your own food and water, but otherwise, a visit to Snow Peak Cabin is where glamping meets backpacking. Since the parking lot at the top of Sherman Pass is less than a quarter-mile north of Highway 20, trailhead access couldn't be easier. A SnoPark permit is required in the winter and funds the snow removal that makes year-round access possible at this highest mountain pass in Washington state. No permit is required for summer access.Begin the hike by crossing Highway 20, as the parking lot is on the north side of the pass, but the trail to Snow Peak cabin is on the south side. From the pass, elevation 5,574 feet, begin to climb a series of switchbacks up the northern flank of Sherman Peak on the Kettle Crest South Trail. After approximately one mile, reach the intersection of the Kettle Crest (due east) and the Sherman Peak Loop Trail (due west), as well as a reliable spring. During the warmer months of the year, stay on the Kettle Crest at this junction for the best views of the aftermath of the 1988 White Mountain Fire, noting that the return is via the Sherman Peak Loop. For winter visitors, snow levels and steep slopes make an out-and-back via the Loop trail a better alternative, but be sure to take note of avalanche conditions before you go and carry necessary snow travel equipment. When the two trails reconverge on the south side of Sherman Peak, continue south on the Kettle Crest trail. The trail skirts Snow Peak on its way to the cabin; the pyramid-shaped peak to the right is Bald Mountain. At approximately the five-mile mark, watch for a small spring on the left and the spur trail to the cabin on the right. The spring is the only water source, so be sure to pack a filter. The cabin makes an excellent final destination on this trail, but the adventurous can use it as a jumping off point for further exploration. The Kettle Crest Trail continues to its southern terminus approximately 7 miles distance, passing Barnaby Butte and White Mountain en-route. Approximately one mile south of Snow Peak Cabin on the Kettle Crest, watch for intersecting Edds Mountain Trail (#3) which contours around both Bald and Edds Mountains on a seldom-used trail.WTA Pro Tip: Plan ahead, especially if you'd like to book the cabin on a weekend. According to the Colville National Forest website, reservations must be made at least two days in advance. The longest length stay is five consecutive nights.

The park was founded in 1937 by Seattle Park Board member Archie Phelps, Judge William Long, Ben Evans of the Seattle Park Department, and Scout leader Clark Schurman, who was an expert mountaineer and wilderness camp developer. The park and its well-known centerpiece, Schurman Rock, were built by the Works Progress Administration from 1937 to 1941.Camp Long contains old growth forest, including alder, birch, maple, Douglas fir, Sitka spruce, and cedar. Several trails crisscross this forest, including the Animal Tracks Nature Trail (0.34 miles), the Ridge Trail (0.11 miles), the Middle Loop Trail (0.45 miles), and the Lower Loop Trail (0.53 miles). There is a 0.1-mile spur trail, leading to Longfellow Creek, that exits the main area of the park at the northeast corner.

The Walt Bailey Trail was constructed in the 1990s by a CCC crew thanks to Walt Bailey’s vision for a trail in this area. Unfortunately, the land has fallen into disrepair and is rough going, though for the most part easy to follow. Roots and rocks are the status quo, interrupted occasionally by gravel, making hikers marvel at the distance the trail crew covered to get it in. But if you brave the trail and pack enough bug spray, you’ll be rewarded with a visit to a tranquil little lake basin, with fewer visitors than many of the neighboring trailheads.Start from the undeveloped trailhead at the end of FR 4032. The trail takes off right away, climbing moderately through second-growth forest, offering peek-a-boo views of the ridgeline across the way. Switchbacks begin to lead you more steadily uphill before arriving at the first of many meadows, where the rooty tread gives way, surprisingly, to nicely crushed gravel.But the good material doesn’t last long. Soon it’s back to steep switchbacks over roots and rocks. The water that makes the lakes above so delightful soaks the roots lower down on the trail, so watch your step here-–wet roots make for treacherous hiking.Shortly after climbing out of the first basin, you’ll arrive at another, larger basin, dotted with more lakes. Here the trail becomes a little difficult to follow, but you’ll know you’re on the right track when you arrive at the base of a talus slope. Cairns mark your way up the talus, switchbacking up before leading you into the forest, the entrance marked by an enormous hemlock to the left of the trail. Resume hiking, again on rooty trail, switchbacking steeply up and up, heading for the ridgeline. From this section of trail, the pointed tip of White Chuck Mountain is visible across the valley, and the valley below you is dotted with lakes.Pushing up and over the ridgeline, you'll arrive in the Cutthroat Lake basin, a great place to stop and have a bite to eat among lots of little lakes. It's 6.8 miles round trip to this lake basin, but it's possible to extend your trip to 10 miles by heading up Bald Mountain. WTA Pro Tip: If the bugs decide to have a bite as well but you're not quite ready to head back to the car, keep heading up towards Bald Mountain, the summit that sits at the head of Cutthroat Lakes Basin. The trail continues, climbing 700 feet to a junction with the Bald Mountain trail before making a right turn and heading up again for another half-mile through high meadows, enjoying the views of Mount Rainer before arriving at Bald Mountain's summit."

Despite the relatively short mileage listed here, it's possible to spend the better part of a day exploring the caves and the coulee country surrounding Lenore Lake. With 12,000 years of history, this landscape has plenty to discover. But the trail described below can serve as a nice leg stretcher for anyone driving by, staying in nearby Dry Falls State Park, or fishing one of the many large lakes here. The caves themselves are shallow, created during the Great Missoula flood as water pulled chunks of basalt from the walls of the coulee. After the waters retreated and the caves had been created, early native people used these areas as shelters. The area is still used by Native Americans as a sacred area and a gathering ground. Hikers share this area as well, and can explore this geologically fascinating place, whether it’s just for a leg-stretch or an all day visit. From the parking lot, head up a staircase carved into the rock, complete with handrail! The trail becomes more trail-like at the top of the staircase, where you are faced with a decision. Head left (north) or right (south)? The most developed and well-maintained trails are to your right.The trail to the left seems welcoming, but quickly becomes overgrown and hard, even potentially dangerous to follow. So if you’re looking for a more traditional hike, or if you’ve got little ones, stick to the right. Proceed south. Along the length of this trail, you’ll pass seven caves of various sizes. These are not deep caves—for most of them a headlight would be unnecessary—but they are relatively large, and provide nice photo opportunities as well as the possibility to guess how they may once have been used. Have little ones make up stories about who once lived here. The trail ends at a deep pit in the ground, where a trail leads to the largest cave, which beckons as a shaded place to rest and enjoy lunch before heading back the way you came. WTA Pro Tip: There is lots of wildlife to enjoy here. Birds of prey soar and butterflies flit, while reptiles soak in the sun. Speaking of which, be on the lookout for rattlesnakes here. If you see one, don’t touch or poke it with sticks. Give it a wide berth to continue your hike, and keep an eye out for it on the way back."

And, in season, note a few wildflowers.You can download a park trail map from the specified link. Note that some older maps refer to the park as ""Weowna Beach Park,"" a complete misnomer since the park has no beach or lake front, and views out to Lake Sammamish are limited to occasional narrow openings through the foliage. The entire park offers many large conifers, apparently genuine old-growth as there is no sign of the large stumps seen in other areas that have been logged, such as at Tiger Mountain. Large deciduous trees also are present in Weowna Park.While this is not a wildflower hike, in spring you are likely to see a few blooms of salmonberry, thimbleberry, creeping raspberry, salal, avens, and a few others.The park trails are well constructed and have been barked for a soft footing. In steeper sections the route follows carefully built wooden staircases.As you leave the trailhead, the uphill begins immediately. You will gain about 230 feet in the first quarter mile to reach the highest point of the hike, where a short side trail heads west out of the park to SE 9th Street. The main trail leaves an old park road and continues on south, dropping gently for a while. In about a quarter mile, come to another park road heading east. The main trail leaves the road, continues across a couple of gullies, and comes to another side trail that leads out of the park to reach SE 16th Street. About 0.3 miles farther along on the main trail, come to a crossing of Phantom Creek on a rustic wooden foot bridge. The creek often is little more than a trickle, although the flow can be much greater after heavy rains.Ironically, Phantom Creek is completely artificial. It began in the 1890s when a would-be farmer near Phantom Lake, 0.3 miles to the west, sought to increase his farm acreage by lowering the lake level. The lake formerly drained to the west, but some powerful digging, plus blasting with dynamite, created a new channel draining east toward Lake Sammamish. The resulting deluge, while temporary, must have been impressive. It washed great amounts of sediment into Lake Sammamish and caused considerable damage to a lakeside farm. (All this in an era before environmental impact statements were required.) Many years later, the highly-eroded creek channel was restored by the city to resemble a natural stream, as you see it today. Just beyond the creek crossing, a short side trail leads out of the park to SE 19th Street. A few feet farther along, the main trail forks. For the best views of the creek and canyon, take the left fork. Near the upper end of the canyon two viewing platforms have been constructed to provide views of the creek, but the views often are limited by vegetation. Your best views of the creek may be found farther down the canyon, beyond the viewing platforms.At the next trail junction, stay left again. Follow Phantom Creek all the way down to street level where the creek flows into a wide settling pond designed to catch sediment that otherwise would end up in Lake Sammamish. The trail continues on a few feet more to W. Lake Sammamish Pkwy SE and a tiny parking area easily overlooked from the street.To continue your hike, head back upstream and, at the first signed trail junction, turn left onto the South Loop. In 0.3 miles, a short side trail heads out to 168th Ave SE. The South Loop trail continues on a quarter mile to reconnect with the main trail near the crossing of Phantom Creek, and from there you can return to your trailhead the way you came."

Winter hikers, in fact, have to avoid sections of the road and hike the knife-edged ridges for the last couple of miles.The parking area was built by volunteer labor from the local snowmobile club back in the late 1970s when the nearby Bluewood Ski Resort was built. Snowmobilers continue to be the primary users of this Sno-Park, but snowshoers and skiers also flock to the area. Most trails begin at the end of a long ""expressway"" that parallels the road from the Sno-Park for nearly a mile before ducking under the road, through a 6-foot-tall culvert.On the other side, the trail climbs a steep bank and follows the snow-covered road. Just a couple miles up the road, the trail forks at a registration box. Stop here long enough to sign in, and then continue straight ahead on the main road. In just 0.1 mile, another fork is met. Stay right at this junction, and continue to climb for another 1.5 miles as more and more views greet your eyes. The road you are following was cut into a steep valley wall, but in twenty years of enjoying this area, I have never seen a single avalanche on this section. As you near the head of this valley, the route levels off in a broad open meadow. Most traffic (skiers and snowmobilers) will take off to the left, cutting through the meadow to angle back toward the top of the ski area. Instead, follow the path to the southwest into the trees. After a long, arcing 0.5 mile, a third junction is encountered. This is where you leave everyone else behind and head for the wild country. Take a left onto this narrow track into the trees and begin climbing a twisting, turning two-track path. This route parallels the boundary of the Wenaha-Tucannon Wilderness Area. If you step twenty paces or so to the left, you are in the wilderness.This route climbs gradually, occasionally breaking into small open meadows with views into the deep Wenaha Valley. Take a few minutes to study the valley below because you might see elk, or at least their paths worn into the deep snow. At about 8.5 miles, in a shallow saddle, you leave the road. Hike into the deep snow to your right until you reach the top of a small prominence. Bear south once more, sticking to the contour of the ridge top. The ridge grows ever steeper and more narrow until, after about 2 miles, you find yourself looking down into a deep saddle in the ridgeline. The ridge crest is no more than 12 feet wide at this point and at the bottom of the saddle--some 200 feet below.As you start the final 0.5-mile climb to the lookout tower ahead, the ridge narrows to 6 feet in places. Stick to the middle, and you'll be fine--you're actually walking on rock here. Fierce winds whip up out of the Mill Creek basin on your right and crash down into the Wenaha Valley on your left.At the top of the final pitch, find the lookout tower--now boarded up and secured against the bitter winter winds. Enjoy the view, and then move off to the eastern edge of the rocky plateau where an old ranger cabin, stock shed, and corral are found at the edge of the forest. Set up camp on the leeward side of these buildings for a quiet night. If you have any energy left after making camp, follow the road east, down past the cabin, and in just 0.25 mile, you'll encounter the main road (which you abandoned some miles before). Cross this road, and hike to the top of the cone-shaped peak directly ahead. This is Squaw Peak, and it is within the Wenaha-Tucannon Wilderness. It is about the same elevation as Table Rock, but where the view from the lookout is down into the protected Mill Creek watershed, the view from Squaw Peak is down into the protected wilderness area. Looking south, you'll see the Oregon Blue Mountains (just 2 miles as the crow flies) and on clear days, you can make out the jagged peaks of the Seven Devils bordering Hells Canyon, as well as the peaks of the Wallowa Mountains.Author’s Rating: BackcountryThese routes follow topography rather than trails or roads. Skill with a map and compass is essential. A variety of conditions may be encountered along backcountry routes, including steep elevation gains and losses. These routes require complete competence in winter survival skills, avalanche and snow condition evaluation and some basic mountaineering skills.Author’s Rating: Most DifficultHikers should have good experience and familiarity with snowshoes. This route features sections that will need to be evaluated for avalanche safety every time. Trails climb considerably and may include climbing to ridge tops. Traverses across forested or open slopes may be required. An ability to self-arrest with an ice axe or trekking pole recommended."

While the eagles focus on fish, the local populations of red-tailed and Cooper's hawks hunt inland for upland birds, rodents and small mammals. The prey animals find shelter in the rich ground cover of the canyon. Ever-present sagebrush provides the best cover, but the little beasts also scurry under the clumps of balsamroot and other desert vegetation. The trail climbs into the canyon, which holds the only native forest in Grant County. The forest is mostly pine (ponderosa and lodgepole), but some Douglas-fir also is in the mix. Those trees make this canyon a logical home to birds of all kinds, and the result is a bird lover's paradise.

This exposed section allows hikers to see the mighty Columbia shimmering below, cut by windsurfers enjoying the strong breezes that regularly blow through the gorge. Your first stop is Angel's Rest, which you'll acheive in just 2.8 miles as you hike through a former burn area. On the way, you'll pass a couple of waterfalls. Hike by the top of Coopey Falls on the trail, and just a little later, the more ambitious can take a short, somewhat dangerous side trail to Upper Coopey Falls. Soon you'll come to a footbridge crossing Coopey Creek, the feeder to both falls, where the trail begins to switchback toward Angel's Rest. At the overlook, views of the Gorge are incredible, but keep one eye on the edge--it's a long way down to the river from here. Once you've gotten your fill of views, continue on the main trail, switchbacking up to a junction with Foxglove Way, about a quarter-mile from Angel's Rest. . Foxglove Way continues for about a mile, before arriving in a swampy, brushy area, which is the junction with the Foxglove Trail (different than Foxglove Way). When you arrive at the junction, proceed straight ahead to join the Foxglove Trail. A sign here indicates that Devil's Rest is just about a half-mile further on.The summit of Devil's Rest is treed, but don't be disappointed! There's a good view nearby. Just before arriving at the summit is a sign marked for the Devil's Rest Trail. Descending eastward on this trail, hikers will arrive at a side trail which leads to a viewpoint that offers what Devil's Rest itself cannot: views of multiple peaks, a shining ribbon of water in the gorge, and wide open skies. On a clear day, expect to see Mounts Adams, St. Helens, and Rainier, as well as Skamania Island in the mighty river below. Take a moment to snap some photos and take in the views before heading back to the Devil's Rest Trail, where you will head east and pass yet another, less impressive viewpoint and a couple of small footbridges.Give your legs a break by traversing the ridgetop, then engage your quads for the descent along a set of switchbacks. You're heading to a junction with two other trails: the Wahkeena Trail, which heads east to iconic Multnomah Falls (and the crowds that come with it). The Vista Point Trail veers north, heading for Fairy and Wahkeena Falls. The trail you want is Wahkeena, though you won't be heading all the way to Multnomah Falls. In a little less than a mile on the Wahkeena Trail, you'll arrive at another junction. Make a left to rejoin the Angel's Rest Trail and begin a half-mile climb to a more level section which crosses Mist Creek on a log footbridge. Pass the Foxglove Trail (this time at a lower junction than you previously used). Soon,you'll return to the Angel's Rest Trail's junction with Foxglove Way. Turn onto Angel's Rest Trail and head down the hill for your last stretch to your car."

The trail continues to the right, and in another half a mile, arrives at Lake Lillian, medium-sized and very pretty.Rough(er) trail continues to Rampart Lakes, skirting lake Lillian on the left.All in all, a superb way of getting to Lake Lillian, much prettier (and shorter) than the road-walk-then-clearcut official trail."

Douglas Wilderness and beyond. Once the site of a U.S. Forest Service lookout, Goat Peak’s 6,400-foot summit showcases such impressive gems as the Goat Rocks, Bumping Lake, Mount Rainier, Fife’s Peak, and the Stuart Range.There’s no question how the peak earned its name; the steep trail from Hells Crossing climbs over 3200 feet in less than 3.3 miles. It’s certainly the shortest route to the peak, but seems relentless, requiring strong hooves and the energy of a mountain goat.The trail leaves the parking lot and immediately begins its uphill climb on a narrow path which travels through forest and alongside a small creek. Within the first mile, it leaves the creek and begins a traverse eastward where the trail becomes even narrower as it crosses a dry hillside. Luckily, it is on hillsides like this where flowers of all varieties are delicately sprinkled amongst rocks. Purple and pink varieties of penstemon provide a welcome distraction along the steep trail. Angling into the ridge the route offers some views of the surrounding hills, then switchbacks a few times before contouring with the ridgeline as it climbs closer to its goal. Before you pass another mile, the trail swings eastward to a rocky overlook for your first full view of Fife’s Peak.The trail travels just below the crest of the ridge through areas of forest, huckleberry bushes, and along steep hillsides of rock covered only by a thin layer of dirt. These areas require an attentive step and a close eye. Looking up the trail one cannot help but recognize there are no stretches of flat pathway as it continues through more forest and shrubbery. Near 2.8 miles, the trail alters its uphill course eastward across a talus slope just before meeting its intersection with the American Ridge Trail 958. Turn right and follow the obvious path through a final few switchbacks under the welcome shade of tree cover. Before long, the trail breaks out into an open, rocky hillside switchbacking up to the crest of American Ridge. At a landing just below the high point, the trail continues westward along the American Ridge, providing alternate ways to ascend or descend from this peak. Take the very short boot path to the right, which leads through big rocks and windblown trees to the top. As noted, views here are expansive and they are most definitely your reward for the hard work in getting there."

Fortunately, the lack of standing water means most of the bugs are creepy crawlers rather than buzzing skeeters, which leaves you free to enjoy the grand views and lush flora and fauna without pesky biters and blood suckers.The trail starts with a steady climb up a steep, badly eroded trail through the forest.

Just across the water, a sign points uphill with the simple word “Falls.” The bootpath up to the base of Skookum Falls is rough, and spray from the falls can make the path slick. Use caution if you choose to get a closer look. The falls puts on the best show when it’s flowing in full force, usually in late spring and early summer.

The next 1.5 miles climb an additional 800 feet, putting you at the Loowit Viewpoint at the west end of Johnston Ridge, near a long hairpin turn in the highway.

Instead of the usual cliffs and boulders of basalt, this area features bluffs and badlands of the Ringold Formation, ancient river and lakebed sediments laid down by the Columbia River system between 8.5 and 3.4 million years ago.  The south section of the White Bluffs in particular contains so many possible routes and variations that it would take numerous visits to explore them all.  On this hike you’ll drop down through the bluffs and walk along the last free-flowing stretch of the Columbia River, climb to a ridge walk with panoramic views, and perhaps visit a sandstone pillar. You’ll likely see flocks of water birds, tracks of the myriad denizens of the shrub-steppe, and, if you’re here in the evening, hear the songs of coyotes.The trail begins atop the bluffs at the White Bluffs Overlook with its sweeping view of the entire White Bluffs – Hanford Reach area. To begin your hike, walk around the gate and follow the old paved Ringold Road as it descends the bluffs. Watch for ripple patterns and multi-hued depositional layers in the cliffs beside the roadway. This is one of the best and most accessible exposures of the Ringold Formation to be found anywhere.After about a mile the road crosses a bench and then descends to river level through a large cut. Follow the road below towering bluffs until you’re a couple of hundred yards from the power lines (approximately two and three-quarter miles from the trailhead), then head left across the flats to the trail that climbs into the broad saddle in the low ridge about 100 yards away. If you continue ahead on the pavement, in less than a quarter mile you’ll come to a gate across the road and the south trailhead, easily accessible from the Tri-Cities via Taylor Flat and Ringold Roads.From the saddle go straight ahead on the obvious trail that climbs into a saddle in the higher ridge beyond. Here is a spectacular view across what some call the Great Valley to even higher bluffs. At this point you have a number of options. You can turn right and follow the trail southeast along the crest of the ridge to the high point just beyond the power lines, then drop into the valley for a mile or so of easy walking beneath 300 – 500 foot cliffs and badlands.  A second option is to follow the trail that traverses from the saddle into the valley. And finally, you can turn left and follow the trail northwest along crest of the ridge to another high point.  This makes a great lunch spot. After soaking up the views, continue along the ridge crest, gradually descending to the northwest end of the Great Valley, and then follow the trail as it traverses below the bluffs back to Ringold Road where the road crosses the bench. If you have time, you can easily combine the ridge walk with a tour of the valley. Once back on Ringold Road, it’s short mile back to the trailhead, but if you want a little more, continue across the road to a fainter trail leading to the obvious sandstone pillar above the river. The area around the pillar is very hummocky (evidence of an ancient landslide) with many game trails providing lots of interesting terrain to explore. When you’ve had your fill, make your way back to Ringold Road and climb the final half-mile or so back to the trailhead and the conclusion of another scenic walk in the shrub-steppe."

On this walk, you don’t want to forget your binoculars! The hike starts inauspiciously under the freeway by the sewage treatment plant and right across the river from the railroad yard. Walk fast the first half mile to leave the treatment plant behind and continue along the paved path by the Snohomish River. As it gets quieter, listen for birdsong coming from the thicket of plants growing by the river and alongside the trail. The bright red branches you see in winter belong to the red twig dogwood, a native shrub that thrives in a moist location and is found on riverbanks throughout Washington. Along the way there is an occasional bench to stop and rest. Come to a junction of the Snohomish River and Union Slough, the trail will follow the slough north. In 2 miles you will come to a gravel road and a bridge. This bridge is called Jackknife Bridge, built in 1914. The bridge is one of the few bascule, or counterbalance bridges still standing and is on the National Register of historic places. It gets its name from the way it folded the deck as it was raised. Originally over Ebey Slough, it was replaced in the 1950s and stored in a boatyard. After Spencer Island was publicly acquired, it was towed and placed here. Cross the bridge and come to a T in the trail. The island is divided into two sections, north and south. The north (left) is Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife managed land, hunting and dogs are allowed on this section. For your loop, turn south (right). This area is a Snohomish county park. As this is a wildlife preserve, there is no hunting and no dogs are allowed. Notice the old barn roof. More of it used to be standing, but now it is slowly sinking into the mud. Walk down to the viewing platform and look for herons. Once back on the path, you will see a trail on top of a levee heading out across the water, this is your return. For now, continue down the wide gravel path and cross a long bridge. Make a note of a stump or log in the water. When you finish the loop, check back and see how far down, or up, the water has come--this area responds to the nearby tidal influence of Puget Sound. There used to be a dike here, but the dikes on this side of the island were breached to allow salt water to return with the tides and restore habitat for juvenile salmon. This will encourage more native plant growth and in turn provide a more varied environment for other wildlife. Cattails are one plentiful plant growing here that will hopefully beat out the invasive canary reed grass that was planted when this area was agricultural. Cattail roots thrive in the low oxygen environment of shallow standing water. Where there are cattails, there will be blackbirds, so listen for their distinctive song in the spring. Did you know that the female blackbird is not black like the male, but brown? Look for her hidden among the cattail stems. Note also the wood duck nest boxes and bat houses along the trail and listen for marsh wrens. As you come around to the back side of the loop, you will be following Steamboat Slough. There is lots of brush along this section; if you get lucky, you may see a river otter or maybe a deer. On your left you will see your return trail on top of the levee. The trail in front of you just ends at a breach. Once on top of the levee, you should get some great views of the water-filled island. Here is where to look for ducks, mergansers, green winged teals, buffleheads and of course mallards and lots of Canadian geese. Watch for eagles and hawks above. Cross a bridge and directly west is the Everett skyline. Look north and there will be Mount Baker, east Pilchuck and Three Fingers. You may see the tip of Mount Rainier to the south if the sky is clear. Once across, head right, back to Jackknife Bridge and your return. From here, go the way you came, or keep straight on the gravel road. The gravel road will take you back past the sewage lagoons, a shorter, but less scenic route. WTA Pro Tip: The north side trail is brushy and somewhat overgrown, but offers more wildlife viewing opportunities and good views of Mount Rainier.  Parking just after the Y and taking the river trail from there will add more mileage."

The main canal from Banks dumps its water into Billy Clapp Lake in a thundering waterfall known as Summer Falls (water is released to the falls only in spring and summer to serve irrigation needs throughout the Columbia Basin). Though the lake is man-made, its beauty is entirely natural. A host of animals makes use of the wealth of water here, and native plants thrive in the irrigated basin.Begin climbing the trail and almost immediately enjoy stunning views across the basalt cliff-lined lake. The trail climbs to a low viewpoint, then drops down through a beautiful canyon lined with incredibly colorful lichen-covered basalt rocks and cliffs. After this short (0.2 mile or so) section of rolling terrain, the trail flattens out for the next mile until you reach a bay on the lakeshore. All along this stretch are numerous side paths leading down to wonderful overlooks of the lake--and some of the sidetracks drop down secretive inlet bays with (wintertime) sandy beaches.From the bay, the trail leads upward into the open sage plain along the lakeshore. This prairie is covered with springtime flowers: penstemon, balsamroot, buckwheat, and more. Obvious den sites on the cliffs above make it easy to see why the coyote population is so strong here, and the paths you follow are constantly dotted with coyote scat.As you climb above the lakeshore, you'll gain about 400 feet of elevation above lake level.

At about 3.5 miles, the roar of Dry Creek fills the forest and the trail reaches the creek. This marks a good lunch and turnaround spot, as Dry Creek is without footlog, making for difficult crossing during periods of high water. With caution, experienced hikers may ford the creek.

It was built in the early 1930s by the firefighters who moved into the area to suppress and battle the fires that frequently plagued the area. The cabin was used as an advance supply hut, and firefighters stored and sharpened their tools and cooked their meals here. The scars of the fires they fought are still visible. Many of the fallen trees rotting along the route were killed by the fires and later toppled over. At the end of the trail is the second Siouxon trailhead. Either arrange for a shuttle vehicle to pick you up here, or simply turn around and retrace your steps to the lower trailhead.The Lower Siouxon Trail is the first section of the Siouxon Creek Trail; it makes a great day hike and is often ignored by those planning to hike the length of the main trail. This short route parallels the access road and links the upper and lower trailheads. The route makes a gradual descent for nearly a mile, but doesn't drop all the way down to river level. For the next 2 miles, the trail stays above the south bank of the trail. You may be able to see and hear the river occasionally, but the Lower Siouxon isn't really a river trail. It is, instead, a beautiful forest hike that offers a history lesson. Enjoy the forest for the scenery, the river for the music."

Native Americans took advantage of all those offerings, and this trail lets you do the same. The lakes you'll pass along the route still hold hardy populations of trout. The meadows you'll cross offer a bounty of berries, and, for those who really want to feast at the wilderness buffet, camas root (a starchy staple of the local tribal diet for centuries). Deer and elk browse through the forest/meadow interface, using the timberlands for cover and the meadows for forage. This trail, in short, takes you on a virtual trip through time, leading you back into the wild country that provided so much to the locals that lived here for millennia.The first 1.5 miles gain nearly 700 feet in elevation as the trail ascends the Cultus Creek valley along the south flank of Bird Mountain. About a mile into the hike, the trail breaks out onto a small ridge. Look east from this rocky point, and Mount Adams dominates the horizon. Below the viewpoint, the slope drops steeply away to a broad expanse of blue-green forest between you and Mount Adams. From here the trail turns sharply south as it draws near the cliff faces of Bird Mountain. Pine forests enclose the trail, with occasional meadow breaks and views of the towering cliffs, until the trail passes Cultus Lake at 2 miles. Just a few hundred feet past the lake, a side trail leads off to the left to Lemei Rock and beyond. Stay right on the main trail, and in another 0.25 mile you'll reach a second trail junction. This is the Lemei Lake Trail (No. 179). Here, you'll take the left-hand trail and hike south to Lemei Lake. More like a vast puddle, Lemei Lake is a shallow, somewhat dirty lake. Continuing south through the broken forest (stands of pine and fir intermingled with open meadows and clearings), you'll find Junction Lake at 5 miles from the trailhead. Junction Lake, so named because two side-trails merge into the Pacific Crest Trail at the lakeshore, is a muddy, frog-filled pond at the base of East Crater. Junction Lake is shallow and therefore warm, proving the perfect place to breed a healthy population of mosquitoes, so move on by quickly.From Junction Lake, continue south on the PCT, following it around the west flank of the East Crater, before starting a long, gentle descent to Blue Lake, about 1.5 miles from the junction. The lake offers excellent views of the various small volcanic cones that dot this part of the South Cascades. Blue Lake supports a strong population of rainbow trout. The area is also rich with huckleberry brambles. The lush purple fruit typically ripens in early August, and the berries tend to bring out a variety of pickers, including the natives-black bears!-so take care while enjoying the sweet treats."

There are many ways to enter the tiny wilderness area, but from the south the most scenic access is from the top of Red Mountain, a cinder cone volcano.The trail starts high, and the elevation doesn't change much along the route's length as the trail follows ridges north. The route leads past a historic gathering place of Northwest tribes-the Indian Racetrack-and traverses a long ridge before ending in the shadow of another volcano, Gifford Peak.The trail heads due north for just a mile to reach a junction with the Indian Racetrack Trail. The area was a popular gathering ground for a number of native peoples because of its rich abundance of fish, berries, big game, and a variety of roots and tubers. At the junction with the Racetrack Trail, go right (east) on Trail No. 171A, and in 0.5 mile you'll reach the PCT. Turn north on the PCT and begin a gradual climb to the crest of Berry Mountain, a long, jagged ridge. Berry Mountain is a volcanic formation. It is what remains of vast lava vents that spewed molten basalt onto the land surface. The trail rides the crest of this mountain north. About 4 miles from the trailhead, the trail crosses the true summit of Berry Mountain-5000 feet-and starts a gentle descent to Blue Lake at the foot of Gifford Peak, 5.5 miles out from the trailhead.

Signage and blue diamonds marking the trail is sparse at best. But the trail follows the route of George McClellan's 1852 railroad survey, which provides a navigable and moderate grade. Popular in the summer months for mountain biking, the trail corridor should be easily discernible as you trudge ever closer to Indian Racetrack.After three miles on the McClellan Meadows Trail, arrive at 65 Road and head south to Falls Creek Horse Camp. From here, head east on the Racetrack Trail (Trail 171) toward the heart of the wilderness. Past Falls Creek Horse Camp, there is no reassurance marking once you enter Indian Heaven Wilderness. The trail begins to undulate as it climbs up through silver fir, western white pine, and Engelmann spruce. The trail continues to rise until after 2.1 miles you will finally drop down into a large open meadow. Pause here and reflect upon the echoes of history. Once known as 'Sahalee Tyee', the area is culturally important to many different Native American tribes. Over the past 9,000 years the Yakima, Klickitat, and Umatilla tribes -just to name a few- gathered here for berry picking, hunting, and fishing. Indian Racetrack is named after a long field where horse racing once provided reprieve from the harvest, and likely, much needed entertainment.If you find yourself wallowing in the splendor of this ancient relic, consider climbing further up the 171 trail to Red Mountain Fire Lookout. Less than a mile to the top, this steep trail will lead you to one of the most coveted views of a snow covered Gifford Pinchot National Forest. A sight few, if any eyes, will gaze upon this winter.WTA Pro Tip: Stop into Backwoods Brewing in Carson after tackling this trek. You'll have earned it. Also consider booking a night at Carson Hot Springs Golf and Spa Resort. After a long cold hike, take a load off by climbing into your own personal hot tub. With mineral water pumped from an underground stream you will have no cause to move a muscle as you rest your aching bones."

There's no reason that this 90,000-acre piece of the public domain can't be Olympia's Tiger Mountain. But the area has been long plagued by illegal dumping, shooting, and other problems, causing hikers to shy away. Motorized groups have adopted trails on their half of the forest, and equestrian groups work on nonmotorized trails, but where are the hiking groups? If hikers begin taking more of a vested interest in this forest-volunteering on trail crews, cleanups, and watches-the problems will dissipate. Capitol Forest is getting better, but it's going to take a lot of work from dedicated citizens and some better funding and management from the state to transform this parcel into what it should be-a prime hiking destination.Contemplate this vision as you hike along the Capitol Crest, the rooftop of the Black Hills. From your high start (1880 feet) hike Trail No. 30 for about 0.3 mile to a junction. Turn right onto Trail No. 6, the Green Line. On very good tread begin a rolling ridgetop romp to Capitol Peak. After about 1.3 miles, cross the C Line that you drove in on. Alternating between fir forests lined with oxalis (pretty white blooms in late spring) and raspberry-cloaked ""balds""reminiscent of the southern Appalachians, the trail is a pure delight to travel. Teaser views of the Cascades, Olympics, and Willapa Hills are had along the way.At 2 miles you'll cross the C Line again, this time at its junction with the C-4000 Line on the left and the C-4010 Line on the right. The trail resumes a few hundred feet up the C-4010. Continue through more fir forests and shrubby openings. After 3 miles pass an old hitching point and then climb a little and drop a little through open forest with more peek-a-boo views. At 3.5 miles, cross another road. The trail, now paralleling two roads, climbs a small knoll above them only to descend where they meet up. Here, at 4 miles from your start, Trail No. 6 heads east, rapidly descending off the ridge.This is the end of your trail hike. To access Capitol Peak, walk the road north a few hundred feet to a three-way junction. Take the gated middle road and climb steeply to the 2659-foot peak, second-highest summit in the Black Hills. Under a skyline of communication towers, reach out to sweeping views. To the east are the Cascades, from Mounts Baker to Adams. Rainier is directly in front of you, rising above the Bald Hills. Extending to the north are the finger peninsulas and inlets of the South Sound. To the west, the Satsop Towers rise above the Chehalis Valley, while the Olympics and Pacific Ocean can be seen in the distance. Soak it all in and retrace your steps."

Bighorn sheep can be viewed on the canyon cliffs above the river, too, if you are fortunate.Hike down the old road to the banks of the river and continue alongside the lush riparian world for nearly a mile. As the river starts to bend northward, look for a rough route (an old jeep track) that heads south into the highlands. As you climb this side path, note how the terrain changes to a rocky canyon cliff environment still dotted with small stands of oak and aspen. Up higher, the balsamroot, lupine, serviceberry, and bluebells bloom in spring. Remember to stick to the old roads rather than wandering cross-country because this is prime rattlesnake country: The wide trail of the roadway makes sighting vipers easier than if you were crashing through the brush.The highlands side trip achieves stunning views of the river canyon, but the nearly flat river walk provides plenty of scenery to keep you engrossed. Keep an eye and ear alert and you might encounter grosbeaks, warblers, chickadees, and many other singing birds active in the rich riverside foliage.

There are no awesome views of scores of high peaks over beautiful wilderness rivers, but the scenery is lovely and very enjoyable. Just trekking through a quiet forest blanketed in a heavy quilt of snow is reward enough for this snowshoer.Snowshoers with excellent routefinding skills can cut cross-country through forest and meadow to climb high onto the flanks of Iron Mountain. Meanwhile, less experienced winter travelers can stick to the roadway for several miles. Bear in mind that snowmobilers frequent the roads in the area on weekends, so weekdays may be the best time to visit. Also, although snowshoers hiking cross-country will find the climb to Iron Mountain quiet and snowmobile-free, snow machines may be encountered near the summit because a long, looping road leads nearly to the top of the mountain.Start up the road as it climbs gradually but steadily for the next 2.5 miles. The route slices across a few small clearcuts and pierces some dense, second-growth forest before reaching a junction with FR 1770 on the left. Snowshoe up this short spur road as it curves north and then turns back to the east. After a mile on this road, 3.5 miles from the start, the road curves back to the north. Leave the road here, and climb through the young forest, angling up the slope. There is no trail here, so simply pick the path of least resistance while always going up and slightly to the left (north). The forest here is mixed, with some young second-growth among thinner, old forests and open meadows. About a mile of snowshoeing from the end of the road, after gaining about 450 feet in elevation, cross the wide path of FR 1775 at the top of the ridge. This road meanders for several miles along the ridge crest. Turn left and follow it north as it approaches the high peak of Iron Mountain. About a mile up the ridge, 5.5 miles from the start of the hike, the road forks. The left fork slants out along the southwest side of the mountain; the right fork, the main road, curves around the eastern flank of the peak. There is no easy approach to the summit proper, but this junction is a good turnaround point. Enjoy the views from the ridge, including some nice views west toward Puget Sound, before heading back. Time and distance can be saved with some effort by dropping off the road and heading west through the forest immediately. This means dropping down the slope at a steeper angle than where it was climbed, but the main route, FR 17, is directly downhill from FR 1775. No matter where you drop off, just head straight downhill, being careful to avoid rocky promontories and tight thickets of brush, to catch FR 17.Author’s Rating: BackcountryThese routes follow topography rather than trails or roads. Skill with a map and compass is essential. A variety of conditions may be encountered along backcountry routes, including steep elevation gains and losses.

But when conditions are good, the physical exertion needed to tromp up this steep-sloped peak is richly rewarded with stunning views of the jagged crests of a multitude of North Cascade peaks. Glacier Peak dominates the horizon to the southeast, but the landscape closer at hand is just as lovely. Because of the frequent, frigid winds, the vegetation of exposed meadows on the upper slopes of Sauk is usually glazed with frilly ice lacing. Hoarfrost, formed by wind-driven moisture and cold air temperatures, creates delicate icy ornamentation on limbs, leaves, and--when they stand still too long--snowshoers.After turning around and parking well off the main road, continue up the roadway on snowshoes. The road repeatedly switchbacks as it climbs relentlessly for another mile through open clearcut meadows and thin patches of second-growth forest. The road continues to climb, now in heavy second-growth timber, until, near the 4-mile mark, views reveal stunning peeks down into the perpetually mist-laden Sauk River valley and southwest toward Glacier Peak. Keep hiking along the windswept road as it rolls along the flank of Sauk Mountain to a final switchback corner at about 4.5 miles. Here Puget Sound comes into view. From this point, near 3600-feet, the road climbs back toward the west to a point directly below the summit of the mountain. This stretch crosses several avalanche chutes and should be attempted only when avalanche danger can be confirmed as minimal. On days when the snow is stable, push on the last mile to the end of the road and the start of the summer hiking trail to the summit of Sauk. The summit should be approached only by advanced winter mountaineers because the upper slopes are icy, steep, and prone to rock- and snowslides. When avalanche dangers are moderate or higher, turn around at the last switchback, or to add a couple of miles to the outing, bear northwest on a small spur road that leads out onto Jackman Ridge. This partially logged ridge is largely unremarkable, but the trail along its crest is mostly level for its 1-mile length, and some excellent views of the upper Puget Sound basin are found along the way.Author’s Rating: BackcountryThese routes follow topography rather than trails or roads.

Along the way, soak in sweeping views of the North Cascades, gaze at Koma Kulshan’s glistening glaciers, munch on an inexhaustible supply of berries, and marvel at old-growth western hemlock forest.In the early 1990s Forest Ranger Scott Paul conceived of the Sulphur Moraine Trail that would climb from old-growth western hemlock forest to the moraines at the foot of Mount Baker. He was supervising construction of a suspension bridge near Lincoln City, Oregon in 1993, when a cable snapped, wrapped around him, and plunged into a gorge. The Sulphur Moraine Trail was subsequently renamed to memorialize the man who designed this diverse and beautifully crafted alpine passageway.The Scott Paul Trail is arguably easiest on the feet and more rewarding to the eyes when traveled in the clockwise direction. Start at the Park Butte trailhead, taking the main trail 603, and passing the first junction with the Scott Paul Trail and the wildflowers of Schrieber’s Meadow. Continue across the appropriately named Rocky Creek and into old-growth hemlock forest, reaching the second junction with the Scott Paul Trail 603.1 at 4500 feet and after two miles on the Park Butte Trail.At the clearly marked sign, turn right and descend gently through the forest and skirting the Railroad Grade, one of Koma Kulshan’s glacier-deposited ridges that extends radially from the mountain. The terrain changes to alpine, with scant trees, myriad wildflowers (lupine, fireweed, and arnica predominate), and an unending gauntlet of blueberry and huckleberry bushes that flame crimson in the autumn. Watch mountaineers ascend the moraine on their way to base camp. The trail parallels the Railroad Grade for a short distance before descending to Rocky Creek. A suspension bridge is present from July through September, and it is recommended to check with the Forest Service beforehand as to whether the bridge is in place. Otherwise, this could be the most challenging ford on the trail. Ascend again, steadily climbing and weaving between moraines. As you climb along Metcalf Moraine, soak in the views of Baker’s snow cone to your north. As you double back, gaze upon Glacier Peak, Three Fingers, and Whitehorse to the south.After 1.5 miles, reach a high point at 5200 feet. For the next 2 miles, the trail follows the contour of Baker’s base. The tread on this segment is rocky, and there are steep inclines to your side, so step carefully. After what seems like an interminable series of switchbacks and creek valley crossings, drop into the valley of Sulphur Creek, the fourth major creek for those counting. Some of the fordings, including this one, can be challenging, depending on rainfall and glacial runoff. Soon you will come to a boggy meadow, at elevation 4600 feet, with views of Sherman Peak (Baker’s summit) and Mount Shuksan. The vistas of these peaks are breathtaking.At this point you will begin to descend into old-growth mountain and western hemlock forest; the full variety of this area’s mushrooms on prominent display. Continue downward 2.5 miles, eventually paralleling Sulphur Creek. When you hear the rush of water, you are nearing the junction with the Park Butte Trail. Cross a wooden bridge over Sulphur Creek, and turn left at the next intersection to finish the loop. You will be back at the trailhead 0.1 miles later.WTA Pro Tip: If you're including the loop in your visit to the Park Butte lookout, the round trip hike is 11.5 miles. If hiking late in the season, bring ample lighting or start early enough to avoid finishing in the dark."

Come in summer for the flowers, in autumn for the larches. Come anytime for the solitude. The hike is fairly easy, but reaching the trailhead isn't. Access to North Navarre is via one of the most grueling roads this side of Bolivia.Composed of a string of jagged peaks exceeding 8000 feet, with glistening alpine lakes set in dramatic cirques ringed by larches, Sawtooth Ridge is one of the most strikingly beautiful regions in the entire Cascades. While the northern reaches of this ragged ridge are protected within the Lake Chelan-Sawtooth Wilderness, nearly 100,000 wild and roadless acres along its southern limits are not, leaving fragile alpine meadows and glistening alpine lakes imperiled by the motorized masses. Ask the Forest Service how they can allow such a pristine environment to be turned over to an activity better suited for speedways and racetracks.Don't despair though, for all is not lost. The Summer Blossom Trail to North Navarre Peak has been classified motor-free. Bike- and horse-free too! Open to boots only, it's all yours to enjoy in peace. From a lofty start at 6400 feet, head off through subalpine forest. In midsummer the lupine paints the path purple, and by September the blueberry bushes brush it red. Whitebark pines assure the presence of raucous nutcrackers and their bellowing kraaks!After an easy 0.25-mile warm-up, the trail heads upward. Perhaps a small creek will be crossed, but don't count on it. Be sure to pack plenty of water for the trip up this parched pinnacle. Silver snags punctuate the greenery.

Stare into South Navarre's awesome cirque. A lake should be in there. The way steepens, cresting a larch-lined saddle. Take in sweeping views north to the Tiffany Highlands. Now traversing an arête (a knife edge between two cirques), reach the wind-blasted high crest separating Navarre's two summits (elev. 7870 ft).North Navarre's 7963-foot summit can easily be reached by heading north on faint tread for about 0.25 mile. Carpeted in alpine tundra and golden lawns and adorned with clusters of contorted pines, the mountainside environment is both harsh and fragile. Take care not to stomp delicate plants. And take care not to get swept off of your feet by the scenery. It's incredible! Especially the Sawtooth Range's procession of pyramidal peaks reaching skyward.

Those willing to complete the eight miles and 5,700 feet of climbing needed to reach the pass are rewarded with incredible views of the lake gorge, the Stehekin Valley and peaks stretching from the Cascade Pass area to the Glacier Peak Wilderness. The trail starts just behind the Golden West Visitor Center on the south end of the Stehekin Landing. It follows the Purple Creek-Imus nature trail for a short distance before branching off to the right and beginning its steady climb uphill. At this point, buckle in - you have a long hike ahead of you. Plenty of water is a must-have, because the last source of water on the trail is the crossing of Purple Creek, which comes too early to be of much use. Much of the early trail is still scarred by wildfire, and it's not uncommon for dead, charred trees to fall and block the trail. Trail work in 2011 cleared many of these, so the route is clear until you reach 4,000 feet in elevation. Above 5,500 feet, the trail was mostly spared from the wildfires, so it's only between these two points that blowdowns are a likely obstacle (although this could easily change at any time, particularly over the winter). The trail climbs up the slope above Stehekin for a mile or two before crossing back into the Purple Creek drainage. The trail traverses to the south-facing back side of the ridge on the downlake side of the drainage. This section of the trail is hot, dusty, dry and brushy. Footing at times can be loose and presents a potential danger while hiking. After what seems like an interminable series of switchbacks, you once again cross the ridge line and attain the Purple Creek drainage at 5,500 feet in elevation. The trail starts to yield its rewards at this point - wildflowers, old-growth subalpine firs, and views of glaciated peaks to the north and west. A final traverse of a granite face brings you to the pass at 6,884 feet. From here, views open up in all directions. You'll get partial views of Glacier Peak and direct views of the peaks around Holden. You get a commanding and unique view of Lake Chelan and the impressive face of the ridge towering above the far shore. To the east is a basin full of pine and larch. You can either start back down or follow the trail around an unmarked 7,200' butte to a junction that will take you down to a small lake in the basin or - if you want even more climbing - up to 7,400' Boulder Butte. Either way, it will have been a rewarding day; and if you believe that the effort of a big hike is a reward in and of itself, then there are few trails more rewarding than this."

Based on length and elevation alone, the description fits. McGregor is eight miles one way and gains more than 6,000 feet on its way to the summit. Few hikes put up bigger numbers; but you rack up the elevation at a comfortable rate of 800' per mile, allowing many hikers to surprise themselves by what they can do on this trail. As long as you're used to spending ten hours in a day hiking, you may find yourself above 7,000 feet wondering what all the fuss was about. Those who don't let themselves get scared off by the numbers find themselves in a world almost as far removed as you can get from the forested valley below. McGregor is the most prominent peak in the Stehekin Valley and towers over it at a maximum elevation of 8,000 feet. Even if you don't make it all the way to the top, you'll be in a true alpine environment. That - and the views - makes this one of the best hikes in the state. As you climb, the trees thin, first turning to stunted sub-alpine firs then suddenly disappearing into open talus slopes and scattered larches. At the same time, breathtaking views open around you as you climb above Heaton Camp, less than a mile from the summit. Soon after, you reach trail's end, with nothing but boulders and scree waiting to be conquered. Here the trail changes character. The final push to the summit is an exposed scramble. While presenting relatively little in the way of technical challenges, the footing is very loose in places, and rockfall is a real risk - particularly at the entry to the scramble. A fall here could easily be fatal, so even on level terrain, it's good to place good handholds. The scramble route starts at the top of the talus and scree slope directly in front of the end of the trail. It is well marked with red and orange arrows painted on the rocks (you can also follow the old wire that presumably ran at one time to the lookout that has since deteriorated to almost nothing - the wire is surprisingly intact for being exposed to the elements for so long). At the top of the talus slope, you'll head to the right, then swing back to the left, then hit a gully with loose rock and boulders. Make sure no one is beneath you when you cross it, because it is easy to dislodge rock here, and once it starts going, it doesn't stop until it hits the talus slope below. Also make sure you have good handholds. From there, the trail angles further to the left and winds around until heading back to the right to a notch between McGregor to the right and a lower summit to the left. You'll cross a snowfield above the Sandalee Glacier before resuming an easier rock scramble to the true summit, marked by a radio repeater station. The views are astounding."

On a clear day, the snowy ridges of Chowder, Bastille, and Heliotrope radiating outward from the volcano’s summit draw the eye toward the vast ice and snow of the Coleman and Roosevelt Glaciers. After savoring the views and enjoying a thermos of hot cocoa or soup, retrace your steps back to the car.   WTA Pro Tip: Glacier Creek Road is also frequented by snowmobilers and skiers in the winter months; exercise proper trail etiquette by staying to the right when snowshoeing."

Pick up an interpretive guidebook and follow the signposts, first right, then back. Trees and shrubs along the river bank were planted in a partnership between the City of Centralia and the Chehalis River Basin Land Trust to protect salmon habitat. As they grow, cottonwood, red-osier dogwood, and willow will restore eroded river banks and create spawning grounds for threatened char. In the meantime, they provide superb bird-watching, including bald eagles, a pair of which resides here year-round. Note, too, the mature black cottonwood forest across the river. The largest such grove remaining along the Chehalis, this ribbon of riparian woodland is protected in perpetuity under a conservation easement.At 1.2 miles, reach the end of the north branch of the route. Note the expansive agricultural fields; they soak up water from the treatment plant and act as a filter before it reaches the river. Follow the path back past the T-junction to the south branch at two miles. Continue on the south branch to its terminus at 2.6 miles, where a thick grove of Douglas-fir and western red cedar towers over a 90-degree bend in the river.

It's reached from W Beaver Lake Dr SE. There is no entry fee, and a sign at the trailhead indicates the park closes at dusk. The morning opening hour is not specified, so perhaps ""dawn"" is intended.The Preserve offers a 1.2 mile loop trail that is nearly level, having an elevation change less than 50 feet. For a map, see the Trail Maps link at www.sammamishwalks.org. While Beaver Lake provides the southern boundary of the Beaver Lake Preserve, the loop trail is strictly a forest trail and does not include any of the lakeshore.The loop trail passes through moist forest with a lot of very large trees, both deciduous and coniferous. A few well weathered stumps hint at the size of trees earlier loggers harvested here. The stumps seem no larger than the bases of the largest trees you see today, so perhaps some old growth does remain in the park.While the loop trail has no lake of its own there are areas of standing water, and hanging moss and ferns are everywhere. You are likely to hear frogs, and perhaps the call of a raven or a woodpecker. A sign at the trailhead indicates there have been occasional black bear sightings, so stay alert. In season you may see a few wildflowers including trillium, Oregon grape, salmonberry, miner's lettuce and a lot of skunk cabbage. Begin your hike by heading north from the parking area on the obvious trail. After 600 feet or so any equestrians or bikers are shunted off onto a separate trail that leads to Soaring Eagle Regional Park. The ongoing Beaver Lake Preserve trail veers sharply left, and is signed for foot traffic only. A few bikers seem to find this change confusing, and you might see occasional bike tracks in soft sections of the ongoing loop trail.Part way around the loop, a connecting trail leads to the nearby Hazel Wolf Wetlands Preserve that has a loop of its own. So it's possible to include both loops in a single hike. For additional details, see our Hiking Guide entry for the Hazel Wolf Wetlands Preserve. Note, however, that dogs are not allowed on Ann's Walking Trail at the Hazel Wolf Wetlands, and the connecting trail will lead you directly onto that trail. So, if you plan to include the Hazel Wolf Wetlands in your hike today, please leave your dog at home.As you hike the Beaver Lake Preserve loop trail you will find occasional signs that offer comments on various plants and animals that are seen in the park. About 2/3 of the way around the loop your trail will cross W Beaver Lake Drive SE then come to a signed, short side trail that leads about 100 yards to the Picnic Meadow. You can check it out if you like. The meadow is in a pleasant, grassy setting but as of spring 2015 it offered no picnic tables or any other facilities. From a slight rise at the far side of the meadow, a few hints of Beaver Lake can be seen through the trees. This is the only point on your hike where you will be able to see any of the lake.Return to the loop trail and continue on, now heading back north. Soon, the trail re-crosses W Beaver Lake Drive SE then returns to the trailhead parking area to complete your hike."

The eastern portion meanders through the scattered ponderosa pine and black oak trees above Catherine Creek. Nearer the river, the trail skirts past grass-covered rock outcroppings that illustrate the geological history of the area. The western portion of the loop crosses a grassy slope with stunning views of Mount Hood and the Columbia River.  The trail is designed to help people enjoy this scenic portion of the Gorge. Interpretive signs explain the geology, vegetation, and history of the area. Benches are strategically placed at viewpoints to provide a place to relax and take in the scenery. Wildflowers are a primary draw to the Catherine Creek area. No other place in the Gorge has the diversity or duration of blossoms. Flower lovers come here for months to enjoy the annual progression of wildflowers. Purplish-red grass widows typically appear mid-March, blue camas lilies mid-April, and yellow balsamroot mid-May. This hike starts across the road from the parking area. After a short distance, the trail connects with the loop. Keep to the left at all junctions and follow the loop clockwise so that you will have the easier, less steep way up."

Maps for the area are available at the City Hall in Anacortes, as well as the bookstore, the two bike shops in town, and the Mount Erie grocer, which you pass on the way to the trailhead. While it’s not quite as tall as nearby Mount Erie, Sugarloaf makes a great summit—this one doesn’t have a parking lot at the top. From the trailhead off the Heart Lake Road, walk along a flat, wide trail for a short while. Your map indicates that you are passing a lake, but it’s more like a marshland. You’re hiking along Trail 215, which you’ll utilize for most of your hike, but its character changes dramatically during the journey. After a short, gentle jaunt through the valley, Trail 215 takes off sharply from the valley floor, climbing 520 feet in just about three-quarters of a mile. Most of the elevation gain comes in the first quarter mile, so your heart will be pumping by the time you hit a viewpoint that opens out onto Burrows Bay and the San Juan Islands. After the initial climb, the trail becomes slightly more like a staircase, with sections of incline alternating with flatter sections, but use the viewpoint as an excuse to catch your breath before pressing on. The trail switchbacks almost immediately past the viewpoint. Continue climbing—it’s not much farther now! Wind around the summit block and arrive at a crossroads. Straight ahead is a wooden, hiker-only gate with a sign indicating Trail 238. Walk through the gate and hike along Trail 238 for a few hundred feet to an open viewpoint. There are large flat rocks and lovely grassy areas here that make it the perfect place for a rest and a snack. The tree-topped summit in front of you with antennae is Mount Erie, and views extend to either side, so you get a nice view of Burrows Bay again as well as Puget Sound. To return to the trailhead, retrace your steps, or create a new route down using your map. WTA Pro Tip: Mount Erie has a road to its summit, but is accessible via trail. Combining Sugarloaf and Mount Erie makes for a good conditioning hike of nearly 5 miles roundtrip, with plenty of elevation gain. Read our Mount Erie entry for trail directions to the top, or make your own adventure using your map."

One option is to explore a decommissioned road. It's flat grade is perfect for new hikers or those simply seeking juicy berries. Several destinations line this road on either side, so there are a few options for hikers of varying levels of endurance. If you're looking for a very short hike for little ones, head to a beaver pond close to the trailhead. Those seeking a longer route can make for an overlook a little more than one mile from the trailhead, which involves a bit of up-and-down, most notable some steep sections on the approaches to creek crossings.

Entry is free, and official hours are daily 4 a.m. to 11 p.m. Probably you have hiked the classic Discovery Park Loop Trail. That's a great hike in it's own right, and now you are ready to explore some other areas of the park. Today, you will hike through the relatively uncrowded southeast corner of the park, head up to the South Meadow for the views, then get down to the beaches and enjoy a close-up view of the West Point Lighthouse. You'll come back up to the park highlands by a different route for a close look at old buildings in the Fort Lawton Historic District. The hike will include two short sections of the Loop Trail, but mostly you will be hiking other trails or park roads. Many of the roads date from the days of Fort Lawton and are used today by hikers or the occasional park vehicle. The hike is about five miles long, or a bit more depending how much of the South Beach you decide to explore. Elevation change will be greater than on the Loop Trail, but still just a modest 340 feet. Are you ready? Let's go!The Discovery Park Visitor Center, reached from W Government Way, is open Tuesday through Sunday most weeks, 8:30 a.m. - 5 p.m. (closed holidays.) It offers some environmental displays, indoor restrooms, an information desk and trail maps. Maps may be available at the signboard at the north end of the parking lot.From in front of the Visitor Center begin hiking on the wide, paved path that loops around the east side of the Center and heads south. In about 100 yards, leave the paved path and turn left onto a wide gravel path/road. Follow it east and a few feet before it reaches a paved road, turn right up a short set of concrete stairs. At the head of the stairs, admire the small but picturesque madrona tree with peeling bark. Then continue south on the obvious trail, cross a paved road and climb another short set of concrete stairs. A bit farther along, cross yet another paved road and come to a sign with an arrow pointing uphill and proclaiming ""Loop Trail."" It's not actually the Loop Trail but it is a route that will get you to the Loop Trail.Follow that route, mostly uphill but with an occasional bit of down, and never very far from the southern boundary of the park. Eventually, you will come to the Loop Trail. If you have hiked it before, the location will look familiar. Head left on the Loop Trail and follow it as it bends around to the right and passes the South Parking Lot.Soon, come to the highest point on the Loop Trail, at an elevation of about 340 feet. A signpost suggests ""View Point"" to the right, but you will be passing that point later today so you can skip it now. Descend a bit on the Loop Trail, cross another paved park road, and continue on a few feet. Come to a signpost where the trail forks. Take the right fork, leaving the Loop Trail. Cross a level field and, in summer, be alert for the sound of hummingbirds that often are seen in this area. Sometimes they perch briefly on one of the trees along the east edge of the field. The north end of the field is bordered by blackberry bushes (not the native variety). Beyond the blackberries, come out onto the South Meadow.Take the obvious path across the meadow, enjoying the views of the Sound and the Olympics along the way. Rejoin the Loop Trail next to the sand dune, and follow it around to the view point that you probably remember if you have hiked the Loop Trail before. Continue on the Loop Trail just a few feet, then turn off to the left on the South Beach Trail. It's a very picturesque route, with views through the trees out to Puget Sound and farther along, down to the South Beach and the West Point Lighthouse. Two viewpoints have been constructed for your leisurely viewing, but surrounding trees grow vigorously in summer, so the views may be better when leaves are down.Continue on down and down some more, dropping nearly 300 feet. As you approach Discovery Park Boulevard, you can't help but notice a large, industrial-looking complex ahead, even though it's partly hidden by trees. It's the West Point Sewage Treatment Plant, a King County operation supported by taxpayers. Smile! If you live in Seattle you are a contributor.When your trail reaches the road, turn sharply left and head downhill on the sidewalk. Soon, the waters of Puget Sound will appear right in front of you. Leave the road and, unless the tide is extremely high, step over a few logs and find yourself on the South Beach. The sand distribution here is somewhat seasonal. Winter storms often move sand farther off shore, leaving the beach more stony. In summer, more gentle wave action brings the sand back in. So your experience may vary.From the beach, enjoy the expansive views of parts of Seattle and the South Sound, with Mount Rainier and some of the Olympics visible in the distance. You'll likely see a few ships and sailboats out there, and a lot of marine birds.You'll notice driftwood structures on the beach, but are they temporary shelters or just sculptures? Who knows? You can explore the beach in the southeast direction for a considerable distance, and enjoy looking up at the bluffs with their layers of glacial sediment exposed by erosion and landslides. But there is no good way to return to the park trails in that direction so you will need to backtrack, then continue northwest along the beach toward the West Point Lighthouse.At sufficiently low tide you can hike the beach all the way around the point for views of the lighthouse from all sides. When insufficient beach is exposed, don't risk hopping on the wet, slippery rocks. Just step up to the pathway next to the fence and retreat east where the fence ends. There, you will be able to enter the lighthouse grounds (yes, it's OK). Head north past the building adjoining the radar mast, and exit the gate to reach the North Beach.The views are as good as those from the South Beach, but you will be looking toward the North Sound, with Mount Baker visible in the distance beyond Edmonds.At low tide, you can hike the North Beach, perhaps all the way around the distant point. But be aware the beach does become narrower, and generally more stony as you continue. At some point you may want to detour up to the park road that follows the shoreline. So, unless the tide is really low, be alert for an obvious path heading inland from the beach a few feet before you reach some trees. If you travel as far as the rock riprap, you have gone too far. The road is just a few feet inland.As you continue along the road, you'll become aware of a high wall or berm on your right, although it's well-hidden by shrubbery. Here and there, a path leads through the brambles to a locked gate posted No Trespassing. As you'll probably guess, it's the seaward boundary of the Sewage Plant, and why anyone would want to trespass there is a mystery. But the postings are insistent. And occasionally, there's even a motion detector that, when leaves are down, may sense your passing on the road and respond with a low-key, recorded audio message suggesting that you leave.As you are passing the Sewage Plant on your right, you may look skeptically at a series of small ponds to the left of the road. But the ponds are not associated with the Sewage Plant. They were constructed to replace natural swamp habitat displaced when the Sewage Plant was constructed, and they are fed by water piped in from Owl Creek upslope from the plant. The ducks relish them, and they are visited by many small animals, including beavers.Eventually you will come to the end of the road. A short, rough path drops down massive stone steps to the beach. You can check out the beach if you like although you may find this section less friendly than the ones you've already hiked. When you are ready, start up the obvious trail on a series of steps. If parts of the trail seem slightly wet, no worries! Here, you are separated from the Sewage Plant by a small canyon, and any moisture you find on the trail is seepage from upslope. Continue on the trail as it climbs steeply uphill, often on wooden stairs or boardwalks. Emerge at the northern end of the North Meadow. If you like, you can check out the apparent viewpoint just to your left, but there is not much to see, particularly when the trees are leafed out.Follow the obvious path heading south, gently uphill, through the meadow. Pass two side trails, both signed for the Hidden Valley Trail that heads back to the South Beach. You can explore this trail a different time. Cross over the Loop Trail, and continue uphill on the paved park road. Eventually, when the road levels out, come to Discovery Park Boulevard, about a quarter mile east of where you crossed it earlier.Cross the road and turn left on the sidewalk. As of early 2015, a temporary fence had been erected along the sidewalk to protect an area where forest vegetation is being restored. Perhaps by the time you do your hike the fence have been removed.Continue east on the sidewalk, and note some of the historic buildings beginning to appear up ahead. The two long buildings on your left, with many apparent covered windows, are the former horse barns -- a reminder that when Fort Lawton opened here in 1900, automobiles and trucks were not common.Continue on the sidewalk. The buildings off to you left along Kansas Avenue are the former enlisted men's quarters, now beautifully restored on their exteriors, some in pale yellow with white trim, others in red brick with the same trim,. They now are private residences.Your sidewalk leads to a pedestrian walkway across another park road, and then the route continues slightly uphill. In just a few feet, find a set concrete stairs heading uphill to your right. Take these stairs, and in late winter be treated to a multitude of wild currant blooms.The stairs lead to another street that arrives from the downhill side on your right, then loops around clockwise and heads uphill, also to your right. Cross just the lower leg of the loop and note an obvious path heading uphill between the two legs. Take that path and head toward the flag pole.Near the flag pole, you will find some information displays. They are worth reading, and present some of the early history of Fort Lawton. One old photo shows logs being removed from the ""parade ground,"" and it's likely the open meadows you see in the park today once were forest, cleared by the army to provide grazing for horses as well as an area for mounted troops to parade. For additional historical comments, see the footnote to our Hiking Guide entry for the Discovery Park Loop Trail.From the flag pole, seek out the often-faint path heading south and passing just to the right of the fence around the radar tower. It really is an official trail and is shown on the map, becoming more obvious as you continue on. The large, restored buildings you see to your left are the former officers quarters. They also are private residences today.Once you are past the radar, head to the right of the old chapel and continue on the path next to a low stone wall. There, find some information displays about park geology and environment. About 35 feet past the information displays the path forks. Take the left fork, continue on it about 200 feet to a paved park road, and turn left on the road. There are no signs there, but you should see a bright yellow fire hydrant ahead on your left. Continue on the road about 400 feet and turn right onto an obvious gravel path. In a short distance, pass under an arbor that, in late winter or early spring, may be exuberantly covered with white blossoms. Descend a few stairs and find yourself at the edge of the South Parking Lot.When you reach the lot, immediately turn left and head north on the paved surface. At the northern boundary of the lot, the pavement ends and there likely will be metal posts in place to prevent traffic from using the ongoing gravel road. Almost immediately, a gravel path forks off to the right of the road. Take it. If you hike this path in late winter you likely will see more red currant in bloom.Other minor paths will join yours from different angles. Just ignore them. When you come to a major path that crosses your route at right angles, turn right. You should see a set of stair railings ahead. It's the upper end of the longest set of concrete stairs in the park (110) and you need to go down them. At the bottom, continue straight ahead on the paved park road. The East Parking Lot and Visitor Center will appear on your right. For the best footing, just stay on the road until you reach the signboard, then turn into the lot to finish your hike.Now that you have completed today's hike, and perhaps the Loop Trail hike too, you have had a proper introduction to Discovery Park. But wait (as advertisers like to say) there's more! Come back and explore other trails shown on your map, such as the Hidden Valley Trail. And check out the Wolf Tree Nature Trail, a short loop through a skunk cabbage bog reached from the North Parking Lot. And, once you have hiked ""all"" the park trails consider coming back in different seasons to see what has changed. There always is something new here."

The Iverson Railroad Trail begins next to the signboard and heads west, climbing 200 feet or so before leveling off. It's a nice forest walk with a lot of ferns and second-growth trees. In late winter and early spring be alert for yellow violets and trilliums along the way.After 1.5 miles, the Iverson Trail drops a bit and joins the West Side Road (Road 1000), a gated road used by technicians servicing electronic gear. Continue west along the road a scant 0.3 miles where a ""Trail Crossing"" sign will alert you that the main Tiger Mountain Trail (TMT) is just ahead. This section of the TMT officially is closed to mountain bikers, but you might occasionally encounter one anyway. If you do, it's best to remain friendly.Head north on the TMT, skirting the lower edge of a large clearcut. In less than a half-mile, come to a switchback where the TMT makes a very sharp turn to the left. This kink is termed ""Zeig's Zag,"" one of many named locations along the TMT commemorating volunteers who played a major role in its construction back in the 1970s. Unfortunately Zieg's sign is gone now, although the name still appears on the Green Trails Map. As you hike farther on the TMT be alert for additional named locations.At the Zag, a bit of muddy trail crosses a seep and seems to continue on straight ahead. It's worth a five-minute look. In a few feet, a sign proclaims ""Artifacts Trail,"" and in 200 feet it leads to the site of a February 23, 1925 wreck of a logging train. An official-looking sign there identifies the site, and lists the historic date. Most of the wreckage was salvaged at the time, and only a few pieces remain. A set of wheels peers out from beneath a blowdown, and other objects are strewn around. A few feet beyond the wheels, a jumble of metal pieces suggests an abstract metal sculpture. The Artifacts Trail hasn't made it onto the Green Trails Map yet, but if you have a GPS unit and use the NW Topo map it is shown there. The trail past the artifacts offers no additional train wreckage and it has many blowdowns, so you should turn around here and return to the TMT.Continue uphill on the TMT, still in the clearcut area. Cross a logging road that heads up Karl's Peak, a minor viewpoint now topped with a crown of logging slash. From the road crossing you may be able to see part of the summit dome of Mount Rainier in the distance. Stay on the TMT. Beyond the logging road it levels off and does a forested traverse around the west side of Karl's Peak. You'll reconnect with the clearcut on the far side of the peak, at Karl's Gap.Soon you are back in the forest and arrive at Millan's Crossing where the TMT meets the Middle Tiger Trail. To the left, the Middle Tiger Trail drops almost 1000 feet in less than a mile to reach the West Side Road. To the right, the Middle Tiger ""summit"" is only 0.3 mile away and just over 400 feet higher than the TMT. But that route offers no views so it's best saved for your return loop.Continue on the TMT, passing Denny's Bulge and Hal's Cove. But when you come to a sign with an arrow pointing straight ahead to ""Hobart Grade,"" don't go there. That's a side trail that heads downhill to join the Hobart Middle Tiger RR Grade, a different hike. Instead, take the easily-overlooked right turn to remain on the TMT. Pass Paul's Cove, and begin to hear the sounds of Fifteen Mile Creek down below.Custer's Bridge comes up quickly and it's a great place for a break. In the Tigers, gated service roads are never far away, but in terms of distance to a public trailhead, Custer's Bridge is as remote a location as you are likely to find. You might have it all to yourself. The bridge is a low, rustic structure crossing the head of Fifteen Mile Creek. In spring, look along the banks for skunk cabbage. In summer, when the vegetation is so thick you may have difficulty seeing down to the water, look for ripe salmonberries and a few wildflowers. Any time, spring through fall, the bridge is a pleasant stopping point so why not pause here, enjoy a sip and a snack, and relax for a few minutes to the soft sounds of the flowing stream?When you are ready to continue, take the TMT a few feet uphill to its junction with the Fifteen Mile RR Grade. Leave the TMT and follow the RR Grade 0.2 miles NE to Fifteen Mile Pass and the Main Tiger Mountain Road (Road 4000.) This once was the location of the Paw Print Rest Stop, an informal picnic area along the utility road. But early in 2014 it was bulldozed to provide an access road for logging on West Tiger Mountain. The Clivus toilet still is there but the former picnic tables are long-gone, and there is little reason to stop there now.Head south for a mile on the Main Tiger Mountain Road. You are unlikely to see much traffic, perhaps just a utility truck or a mountain biker. Turn right on the obvious, gated Middle Tiger road/trail. This backside approach to Middle Tiger Mountain offers great views across the canyon of Fifteen Mile Creek. All of West Tiger Mountain, with its crown of electronics towers, is visible. Off to the east, some Cascade peaks can be seen. And there is even a quick view of some of the Olympics. Folks who hike Middle Tiger Mountain from the south side and return the same way miss all of this.Eventually, the route becomes a narrow forest trail and climbs to the gently rounded 2,607 foot summit of Middle Tiger Mountain. The Green Trails map indicates a view there, but it's long been obscured by the vigorous growth of small trees. The summit may sport a small teepee-shaped frame of dead branches, although without a cover it would provide no shelter.Now, you can head down the trail on the south-side of Middle Tiger and soon rejoin the TMT at Millan's Crossing, completing your loop. From there, return back to your trailhead the way you came, via the TMT, the West Side Road and the Iverson Railroad Trail."

But before you make a beeline to the river, a little historical appreciation is in order. Start by admiring the Interrorem Cabin. Built in 1907, this structure is the oldest Forest Service dwelling on the Olympic Peninsula. Interrorem served as a ranger station, a base for Works Progress Administration and Civilian Conservation Corps workers, and a fire guard station. Currently it's rented out by the Forest Service for the public to use overnight. Be sure to respect the privacy of any guests who may be staying in the cabin while you're visiting.The first overnighter at Interrorem was Ranger Emery Finch. Mr. Finch, an avid fisherman, was responsible for building the Ranger Hole Trail-a path to his favorite fishing spot, the ranger's fishing hole. The trail leads 0.8 mile to that revered spot. Through mature second growth (cut circa Finch's tenure) the good path climbs a little hump then makes a slow descent toward the river. In April hundreds of trilliums line the way. As the Duckabush's roar becomes more audible, the trail makes a steep drop, emerging at the famed fishing spot.While the fishing isn't what it used to be, you'll still catch some good views of the river. The Duckabush crashes through a narrow chasm here. Frothy gurgling waters crash up against the narrow cleft. Be sure to keep small children nearby while admiring this landmark. On your return, take the 0.3-mile interpretive loop for more information on the Interrorem Cabin and the Ranger Hole."

Traverse view-granting open slopes, bubbling bogs, and stands of primeval cedars and hemlocks. Boulder Lake is one of the prettiest backcountry lakes on the western front of the Central Cascades, yet surprisingly few hikers venture here.Beginning on a newly decommissioned road, walk 1.3 miles to the former trailhead. Then, as you walk an old logging road in a dank, dark, scrappy stand of hemlock, you'll likely not immediately see the hike's charm. Stick with it. Cross Boulder Creek on a big wide bridge, steadily climbing on old roadbed lined with alders. Eroded in spots, the old road makes a wide swing to angle back toward tumbling Boulder Creek. After about 1 mile the grade eases and real trail takes over. Real forest too - and views, as the way traverses the first of several open brushy slopes.On increasingly pleasant tread, begin switchbacking through an increasingly impressive forest of ancient giants. Some of the finest specimens of cedar, hemlock and Douglas-fir in all of western Washington can be found here in the Greider Ridge Natural Resources Conservation Area. Straddling the Puget Sound Convergence Zone (an area where prevailing winds split by the Olympic Mountains reconverge, causing updrafts that can lead to convection and abundant rainfall), this is one of the wettest spots in the Central Cascades. The area's 100 to 180 inches of annual rainfall favors fast - and big - growing trees. Witness too the excessive runoff and boggy areas along the trail. Good solid cedar puncheon, however, assures dry boots and minimal impact on these important and fragile plant communities. After brushing up alongside a small creek, the trail switchbacks once again, crosses said creek, and then traverses a gorgeous grassy bog. Boulder Creek soon comes into earshot before the trail swings away, switchbacking once again, albeit gently this time and through yet more magnificent old growth.At 5.1 miles reach the lake. Yellow cedar, mountain hemlock, and huckleberry grace its shores. Cross the outlet creek on a good bridge to grassy shores ripe for lounging. Stare across shimmering azure waters to rocky pinnacles peaking above boulder fields that slope into the lake. Pretty sign, huh? And a pretty nice place to spend the night too - did you check out those designated campsites?"

In winter, descend past ghostly leafless trees. In summer, appreciate areas of exuberant moss and greenery. And, with luck, you might have the trail all to yourself.The Hidden Forest Trail is one of Tiger Mountain's more remote, internal trails so it offers no trailheads you can drive to. The lower end is along the West Side Road (Road 1000) and the upper end is along the Main Tiger Mountain Road (Road 4000.) These roads generally are gated, open to motor vehicle use only by technicians servicing electronic gear, or by occasional authorized shuttle vans transporting paragliders to the Poo Poo Point launch areas. So your hike on the Hidden Forest Trail needs to be part of a longer loop. One option, perhaps the shortest, is described here. For other possibilities, consult the Green Trails Map for the area. As with any loop, your hike could be done in either direction. But the Hidden Forest Trail is just over one mile in length with an elevation gain of 960 feet, so it has some very steep sections. Accordingly, you might enjoy this segment of your loop hike more if it is done from north to south, when it's mostly downhill. Also, the views may seem better when hiking in that direction. By whatever route, your loop hike will involve some elevation changes that are significant.Begin your hike at the paraglider landing field along Issaquah-Hobart Road. Be alert for any paragliders that might be coasting in quietly to land, then walk across the field to the signed beginning of the Chirico Trail to Poo Poo Point. (The odd name is a reference to the sounds of loggers' steam whistles heard here over a century ago.) Appreciate the picturesque quality of the lower part of the Chirico Trail as it traverses steeply across a hillside on stone steps. Then continue on, with a few switchbacks, to reach the grassy top of Poo Poo Point's South Launch Area. Pause here to catch your breath since you have come up 1,500 feet from the trailhead, and appreciate the view of Mount Rainier to the south, clouds permitting.To the right of an old signboard, note a forest road turn-around. That road will provide the return route for your loop hike. For now, continue on the trail to the left of the signboard to reach Poo Poo Point's North Launch Area. Pause there to enjoy the views to the northwest that may include the Olympics and Mount Baker, again if clouds permit. If your timing is right you may see a few paragliders launching into the sky.To continue, hike past the pit toilet and locate the signed Poo Poo Point Trail that arrives here from the vicinity of Issaquah High School. Continue on that trail about a half-mile, first dropping a little then climbing about 200 feet to reach a former railroad grade and a signed  trail junction. At the junction, take a right turn onto the One View Trail.The One View Trail climbs about 300 feet before dropping into lonely Fifteen Mile Gap (a drainage boundary between Fifteen Mile Creek and Gleason Creek.) Beyond the gap, climb a few feet more and reach the main Tiger Mountain Trail, the TMT.Turn right on the TMT and follow it just 0.1 mile to reach Larry's Crossing where you'll encounter the Hidden Forest Trail. Here, you have a choice. To your left, the Hidden Forest Trail climbs an additional 150 feet and, in about a quarter mile, reaches its upper end at Road 4000. If your ambition is to experience the entire Hidden Forest Trail you will need to hike this short upper segment first, then turn around and return to the TMT before descending the longer, lower segment to reach Road 1000. If you opt to include the upper part of the Hidden Forest Trail in your hike, go for it. The sign along the TMT indicates it's 0.3 miles up to Road 4000. But, when you get to Road 4000, note the sign there claims it's only 0.2 miles back to the TMT. This is not really a contradiction. Hikers know that distances often are shorter when hiking downhill! While the Hidden Forest Trail does end at Road 4000 the route actually continues on, but with a different name. Across the road it becomes the Poo Top Trail and leads another 0.7 miles, with 600 feet additional elevation gain, to reach the West Tiger 1 summit. That's a possible extension for your hike, if your time and enthusiasm allow. Otherwise, turn around at Road 4000, descend past the TMT and continue down the Hidden Forest Trail.About 0.2 miles below the TMT note a junction with an obvious but unsigned trail on your left. It's the Fifteen Mile RR Grade that rejoins the TMT 1.5 miles east, near Custer's Bridge. You might consult your map and keep that little-used, sometimes-overgrown trail in mind for a future exploratory hike.If you are hiking in winter you may catch occasional glimpses of Mount Rainier though the trees, but once trees leaf out in the spring those views will disappear.The forest here on the south side of West Tiger Mountain initially is more open than you may have seen elsewhere in the Tigers. And, because the Hidden Forest Trail descends nearly 1,000 feet, there is considerable variation along the way. In winter, some of the leafless deciduous trees have a ghostly quality. As you continue on downward you will encounter a few trees with very mossy trunks. In summer, when all the plants in the understory are leafed out, the growth can be very exuberant.Lower down on the trail, as you approach Road 1000, the trees become larger and conifers begin to dominate. You will reach the road rather abruptly, next to a small seasonal stream. To begin your return, hike the graveled Road 1000 west 1.25 miles, gaining about 400 feet before the road levels out. You are unlikely to see many vehicles, perhaps none at all, but mountain bikers are a definite possibility.Come to an obvious fork in the road where both branches are graveled and show signs of regular use. These lead to the two launch areas at Poo Poo Point. Unless you want to revisit the North Launch Area, take the left fork and soon you will arrive back at the familiar South Launch Area. From there, descend the Chirico Trail back to your trailhead."

If you don't stop for a bite to eat in one of the neighborhoods along the way, Gasworks Park (on the north side of the loop) and Lake Union Park (on the south side) both make great picnic spots with lake views.There are multiple access points for the Cheshiahud Lake Union Loop, but the most convenient parking is to be found at GasWorks Park at the north end of Lake Union, between the neighborhoods of Fremont and Wallingford. Starting here, head east along a gravel path that parallels North Pacific Street, before bearing left onto the Burke Gilman Trail. This parallels NE Pacific Street and crosses under the I-5 bridge along NE 40th before crossing the Lake Washington bridge just south of the U-District. The bridge is a great spot to stop and watch boat traffic, or get photos of the bridge itself -- it's quite photogenic. Once you're across the bridge, make a right and head down towards the lake. You'll pass South Passage Point Park, one of the many pocket parks along this route. Despite being right under I-5, this secret spot makes for a nice place to sit and take in this corner of the lake before continuing on. The next section of the route winds its way through neighborhoods and business districts in Eastlake. Fortunately, the path is very well-signed, just keep an eye out for red directional signposts topped with arrows marked ""Cheshiahud Lake Union Loop"" pointing the way. The trail is for public use, but remember that you're passing private property; please be respectful of the folks who call this place home. From the neighborhoods and businesses of Eastlake, round the south end of the lake by taking Valley Street, then ducking into Lake Union Park. Here you're a little more than halfway done. The Museum of History and Industry provides a great distraction here, and some places to sit and contemplate the lake are available. However, this section of the loop is also quite close to the ""Mercer Mess"", a section of road in Seattle that nearly always has lots of traffic. You're probably better off continuing on in search of quiet. Once you've followed the trail around the southern tip of the lake, you'll be paralleling Westlake Avenue, a business district. What it lacks in pocket parks, this section of the trail makes up for in street ends that provide overlooks, including the Galer Street End near the large pedestrian bridge roughly a third of a mile from the end of the lake, as well as Blaine, Crockett, and McGraw street ends, in order from south to north. Follow Westlake Avenue all the way to an intersection with Fremont Ave and Nickerson, where the trail crosses the Fremont Bridge. This funky blue and orange bridge is the gateway to the self-professed ""Center of the Universe"" neighborhood. Once you've crossed the bridge, you've got about a mile left.Turn right off the bridge. After one block you'll pass under Highway 99. A two-block, uphill detour here on Troll Avenue will take you to one of Seattle's iconic destinations, the Fremont Troll. He's worth a visit if you're in the neighborhood! Back on the Cheshiahud Loop, rejoin the Burke Gilman Trail, passing the Fremont Brewery on the left and some peek-a-boo views of Lake Union on the right.The last leg of the trail dips back to parallel N Northlake Way, depositing you right back in the same parking lot you departed from. WTA Pro Tip: Just across from Gas Works park are the Wallingford Steps, south of the end of Wallingford Avenue (between Densmore and Burke Avenue). More an art installation than a park, the mosaic here is always worth a stop after your walk around Lake Union."

Along the way you will ramble through some great stands of fir and hemlock and take in some panoramic views to the south, including the north slopes of Mount Appleton. In late summer, you just might startle a bear raking in huckleberries in the flats just east of the lake. Be sure to bring enough water for the full distance to the lake. The lone creek that crosses the trail can be reduced to not much more than a damp smear by late summer.Boulder Lake trail intersects with the Happy Ridge Trail about 0.1 mile from Boulder Lake (elevation 4,300) which is backed up by steep cliff and tree-studded slopes. Its waters ripple in the breezes and cast wavy green shadows on the sand and smooth rock bottom. The huckleberry and azaleas that ring its shoreline put on great reflection shows in the fall. It also makes a fine place for a refreshing swim.There are tent sites, bear wires and a throne-style privy a long stone’s throw from the lake."

The route offers some rewarding diversions along the way, but much of the payoff is in the last 1.5 miles with sweeping views as one ascends the meadows and traverses the switchbacks to Appleton Pass. Plan for an early start to your day in order to enjoy lunch, and perhaps even a restorative nap, at Appleton Pass.The trail starts at the end of the Olympic Hot Springs Road. For the next 2.2 miles you’ll hike on one of the better road to trail conversions. The asphalt was removed, the once hard packed roadbed was scarified and covered with shredded wood to encourage plant growth and hiker-friendly ramps were dug into and out of the culvert removal gulches.  Near the end of the road to trail conversion, the trail descends to cross Crystal Creek.  While on your descent, stop and sniff the air. On a still day you can smell the distinct sulfur odor of nearby Olympic Hot Springs. A new (and rockslide-tested) suspension bridge spans Crystal Creek. Once across the creek and up the hill, you’ll reach the flats of a one time parking lot now growing over with alder. Veer right and head up the grade the 0.2 miles to the Boulder Creek campground. Or straight to head to the bridge across Boulder Creek to access the odiferous hot springs.The campground is so large that it seems out of place.  A generation ago this was a popular car camping destination. Amenities today include a privy and two sets of bear wires. This makes a good base camp for day hikes to Appleton Pass and Boulder Lake, but there is no water supply in the campgrounds. The most convenient water source is a five-minute walk up the Appleton Pass trail.  Campfires are not allowed at the Boulder Creek Campground.Once you step out of the campgrounds, it feels like a proper wilderness trail. The path winds for 0.7 miles through fir, hemlock and cedar and past a few step-over streams on the way to the intersection with the Boulder Lake Trail. From the intersection it is 4.6 miles to Appleton Pass. The foot log that spanned the North Fork of Boulder Creek has washed away, so you will need to either ford it or find some logs to cross on.  Be extra careful when fording. The rocks here roll easily. The route from the trailhead to just after fording the North Fork has a fairly moderate grade. That changes quickly here-the trail has turned on the ""up"".Lower and Upper Boulder Falls have worn deeply into soft rock. You’ll hear them before you get to them. They are each worth the short side trips  to see them– especially after heavy rains or during snowmelt. Shortly after the upper falls, you will cross the South Fork of Boulder Creek on a footlog bridge.  The trail climbs from here through alternating sets of switchbacks and long southward traverses that often run near the creek bank.  At one of the first openings along the creek, take a look at the opposite bank to see a great fanned cone of rock that has poured down and through a cleft in the cliff band. The hills really are alive. The trail emerges from forest and into a teaser meadow. While you can clearly see the alpine slopes and ridges, you still have a ways to go. There’s more forest and grassy wildflower meadows before you get on the set of switchbacks that end at Appleton Pass.  There are several good tents sites at the pass Water is available from Oyster Lake or, earlier in the summer, from even closer snowfields."

But reaching this divine destination first requires a passage through hell. The trail was laid out by climbers-it's brutally steep and requires use of hands in one short section going over a headwall. It's not dangerous, but hikers skittish on ledges may want to opt for another trail. For those who work hard to get to this celestial setting, expect one of the most dramatic backdrops in the Olympics as your reward.Named in honor of Carl Putvin, an early pioneer, trapper, and explorer, the Putvin Trail is as rugged and daring as its namesake. The first 1.4 miles, however, is relatively easygoing, traveling along tumbling Boulder Creek and crossing two narrow ravines before emerging on an old roadbed (elev. 2400 ft). From this point on, the trail climbs more than 2000 feet in 1.7 miles.A quarter-mile beyond the old road, the trail enters the Mount Skokomish Wilderness, wasting no more time in heading to the heavens. With Whitehorse Creek crashing trailside, it's up, up and away. At 3500 feet enjoy a brief respite from climbing by traversing a brushy avalanche chute at the base of a large headwall.As Whitehorse Creek plummets over the sheer wall in a series of breathtakingly beautiful cascades, the trail looks for a way to get over the wall. Angling to the northeast it ascends a series of ledges, some requiring handholds to thrust you upon the rim of the headwall. You made it! Now enjoy an alpine world flush in wildflower-bursting meadows and frog-fortified tarns high on a bench above the Hamma Hamma Valley. Enjoy views, too, of imposing Mount Pershing across the valley and Hood Canal and the Cascades in the distance.At 3.2 miles enter Olympic National Park. Negotiate a crossing of Whitehorse Creek, and then make one final steep grunt over a snowfield and through thick greenery to the heavenly Lake of the Angels (elev. 4950 ft). Perched in an open basin scoured by ice and snow, the setting is spectacular. Cascading waters fed by perpetual snowfields stream down polished rock faces and over terraced ledges. Resident marmots pierce the mountain air with their warning whistles."

A necklace of sparkling alpine lakes adorning bold mountain faces spans this mile-high valley. Wildflowers, old growth, alpine tundra, deer, marmots, bear-they're all here in this outdoor cathedral. Your ticket into this wild kingdom comes at minimal cost-the trail is mostly downhill on a good grade, though you do pay the piper on the way out on a grueling ascent. But it's all worth it.The quickest way into Grand Valley is via the Grand Pass Trail, climbing along Obstruction Ridge and then brutally descending to Grand Lake. Consider this loop as an alternative. Sure, it's longer and, sure, there's more overall climbing involved, but the gentle descent will save your knees and you'll get to traverse the quiet Badger Valley en route. Bursting with flowered meadows and fluttering with animal activity, this valley is neglected by those in a hurry to get to Grand Valley. Don't expect any badgers, though-it was named after a ranger's horse. There are lots of Olympic marmots, however-close enough.Start by heading toward Grand Ridge, making a right turn after 0.2 mile onto the Badger Valley Trail. Descend in the wide U-shaped valley, hopping over rivulets and brushing against clumps of fragrant greenery. Try not to fall into a marmot burrow.After passing the Elk Mountain cutoff at 1.1 miles, enter subalpine forest. Undulating between meadow and forest, cross Badger Creek at 2.8 miles (elev. approx. 4000 ft). Then, with Grand Creek at your side, begin the gradual climb to Grand Lake. The forest thins as you ascend and cross brushy avalanche chutes and march over glacial moraine. After gaining 800 feet in just under 2 miles, come to a marshy area that announces that Grand Lake is nearby.It's a pretty big lake in a pretty big bowl. Cascading waters from above echo over the placid lake waters. Grand Lake is appealing, but the next lake is much grander. Proceed on stones steps and tight switchbacks through a flower-studded meadow of swaying golden grasses to a junction. Your return is via the trail right. Head left. After an easy 0.5 mile, emerge on an open ledge above the sparkling waters of Moose Lake (elev. 5075 ft)-like Badger Valley, a misnomer. There are no moose here; the lake was named for Frank Moose, whoever he was.With easily one of the most spectacular backdrops of any Olympic alpine lake, Moose is surrounded by black-shale pinnacles garlanded with verdant forest. Roam the lakeshore-the open ledge yields to grassy shoreline. Share the crystal waters with fly-snapping trout.When you must relinquish this grand kingdom to the deer and marmots, prepare yourself for the excruciating exodus. The trail back climbs 1400 steep feet in 2.4 miles. Look back over your shoulder while catching your breath. Grand Valley's aquatic jewels twinkle in the late afternoon sunlight.Once you crest Obstruction Ridge, enjoy nearly 2 miles of alpine tundra with sweeping views over the Lillian River valley all the way to Olympus. Grunt up one last speed bump, and then enjoy a downhill glide to close the loop."

The trail drops down gently reaching a view of the Cispus Valley. There are views to Mount Adams, Tongue Mountain and Juniper Ridge. The interpretive sign indicates that Native Americans hunted deer and elk, driving them into a box canyon.A short walk from the viewpoint is the Layser Cave. Discovered in 1982, it is one of the most extensive archaeological sites in this part of the state. Animal bones and stone tools found in the cave have allowed archeologists to trace human history here back nearly 7,000 years.

Pack plenty of water, and if the summit seems a bit out of reach, there are plenty of views to be had on bumps and knolls along the way.Starting in a recently logged over area, Trail No. 809 (scheduled to be rehabilitated by the Washington Trails Association in the near future) winds its way through private timberlands before entering the Olympic National Forest in just under 1 mile. Through thick forest wrapped in rhodies and salal, peek-a-boo glimpses hint at the visual rewards awaiting persistent hikers.After a little bit of climbing, the trail rides the ridge crest, undulating between the Dosewallips and Duckabush watersheds (but no water along the trail) and dipping and blipping along the way. At 3.5 miles pass a small promontory providing a view down to the Duckabush Valley. After a few more mild descents and ascents (which will seem major on the return), the trail ratchets up the climbing.With a thinning forest canopy and more open ledges, bigger and better views assure you it's worth carrying on. Upon entering The Brothers Wilderness at 5.5 miles (elev. approx. 4000 ft), the trail gets down to business, switchbacking relentlessly up a basalt ledge and dry open slopes. At 7.2 long miles, reach the 5701-foot sunny summit.You worked too hard not to stick around. Kick back-the views are incredible in every direction, from waves of craggy Olympic peaks to the west, to waves of saltwater in the Puget Basin to the east. Seattle's skyline shimmers in the afternoon sunlight. A series of remote tarns, the Jupiter Lakes, sparkle in north-facing cirques directly below. While Mount Jupiter is nowhere near being one of the Olympics' highest summits, its positioning along the eastern front and its isolation from other peaks gives it a bit of distinction. Perhaps the Roman god who lent his name to this summit may actually even prefer the views from here than from remote and chilly Mount Olympus."

From here the trail turns downhill and begins a serious set of steep switchbacks through more meadows, scree, and subalpine trees.At 3.0 miles you finally reach a lush meadow overlooking Grand Lake and in another .5 mile you come to the junction with the Badger Valley Trail, which leads to Grand Lake. To reach Moose Lake, stay right here and soon pass lovely Amaila Falls. Continue climbing steadily through the meadows and forests of Grand Valley to finally reach Moose Lake at 4.1 miles. The lake is surrounded by rocky, forested mountains and in the summer it is ringed by showy displays of subalpine flowers.A ranger cabin here is staffed in the summertime, and camping is an option at Moose Lake.

This is high country, with some of the most impressive old-growth stands this side of the Cascades. You'll wander through old-growth cedar, moss and ferns. In spring, the hillsides abound with a frenzy of wildflowers. But the vistas are pure Inland Northwest - vast views of the Selkirks and the Upper Priest River Valley are what hikers can expect along this 19-mile loop.Take two or three days to hike this, enjoying the glorious scenery. And there are great opportunities for wandering -- take a sidetrip and touch your toe into Canada. Scramble up Snowy Top Mountain. Climb to the Little Snowy Top lookout. Hiking clockwise is recommended.The trail immediately gets down to the business of going down - about 1800 feet in three miles - to the South Salmo River. Cross the river, taking a right (at the unmaintained trail to Canada) and follow the river upstream. As you walk in this forested river valley, the flora  may make you think you're actually in the Cascades to the west - old-growth cedar and hemlock tower above you, and an understory of ferns and moss carpet the ground around you. Just before you pass into Idaho (yes, Idaho!), there will be a spur trail on the right to an excellent campsite near the Old Salmo Cabin, an old trapper's cabin set into the wilderness. Water is available here -- replenish your supply, or think about making this your spot to spend a night before continuing on your way.Another 3.5 miles of steady climbing takes you to Snowy Top Pass. another good campsite and water can be found just before entering the pass. Take advantage of this one, and don't expect many (if any) water sources for the next seven miles after. Snowy Top Mountain (7572 feet) will lure scramblers, while those who opt to stay on trail will delight in the views that the Shedroof Divide has to offer in this section. You'll get to wander along here for seven fabulous miles. About 1.5 miles after reaching the divide, you'll pass a one mile spur trail to the Little Snowy Top Lookout, which is open to the public. Dip off the main trail and visit the lookout site for even more fantastic views.Alas, you cannot stay atop the Shedroof Divide forever.

Often sunny here while raining in Vancouver, it is a great place to hike while waiting for snow to melt at higher elevations. This loop hike begins with a walk along an old highway to the start of the Labyrinth Trail. This is where the fun begins. For the next two miles, the trail weaves up though surprising diverse landscape that includes grassy plateaus, a creek with cascades and a waterfall, rocky protrusions, talus slopes, and dramatic views of the Gorge.  At the top of the loop, the trail breaks out onto a grassy slope with unhindered views of the Columbia River. In the spring there is a steady progression of wildflowers, including grass widow, prairie stars, yellow bells, camas, and balsam root. Park at the Coyote Wall Trailhead and head east on old Highway 8, enjoying the striking views of Coyote Wall. Just after the turquoise gate, you will encounter an old cattle chute on the left; continue east along the base of the cliff on the old highway.  After 0.6 miles, you will come to an obvious trail heading uphill to the left. This will be where you rejoin the old highway near the end of your hike.  Stay on the roadway. In another 0.3 mile, just before the road goes through a rocky notch, you will come to the Labyrinth Trail (CO7) junction on the left side of road.Take the Labyrinth Trail (CO7) up the hill. Shortly after beginning, you will come to a junction where you need to stay to the right as the trail climbs through a rocky chute. The trail gets quite interesting here as it goes around basalt outcroppings, hop-scotches through oak groves, and nears Labyrinth Creek. In about 0.3 miles from the trailhead, the trail passes a small cave on the left then comes to Labyrinth Falls where the creek tumbles through a series of cascades. There is a short steep section after the falls, but then the trail levels out with views of the Columbia River. About 0.5 miles beyond the falls, you will see user trails to the right that lead to a scenic outlook. This makes an excellent spot for a break, especially on a sunny day. After visiting the viewpoint, continue up the Labyrinth Trail 0.2 miles to a trail junction near abandoned power lines and a fence. The trail to the left is being decommissioned, so stay to the right. In another 0.3 mile, you will come to the junction with the Upper Labyrinth Trail (CO8). Turn left at the junction to join the Upper Labyrinth Trail. In 0.1 mile, the trail breaks out onto a grassy plateau with outstanding views of the Columbia River to the south and Catherine Creek to the east. This is another perfect spot for a break. After enjoying the panoramic view, return to the Upper Labyrinth Trail and go another 0.3 miles to the junction with the Atwood Road Trail. When you come to the Atwood Road Trail, turn left and follow the abandoned road 0.6 miles as it goes back into a grove of trees, drops a bit to cross a stream, then goes uphill to a three-way junction. Take the track on the far left to an open grassy area where the hike joins the “Old Jeep Road” (CO4). From here on, the hike descends a grassy incline, providing sustained views of the Columbia River and the basalt cliffs of the Gorge. The wide-open vista is eye-popping beautiful, especially in the spring when the wild flowers are blooming. Two miles down the old jeep road, you will pass a trail going uphill to the right and then come to a barb-wire fence. Just before going through a gap in the fence, it is worth taking the side trail to the right to peer over the top of Coyote Wall’s 300 foot rocky cliff. After enjoying the view, return to the old road and go through the fence. Follow the road as it zigzags down the slope, giving you different photo opportunities at each turn. Just after the fence, you will come to the Little Moab Trail (CO3). Turn left to stay on the jeep road. Then, after another 0.2 miles you will come to the Maui Falls Trail (CO5).  Turn right and continue 1.6 miles downhill to the old highway.Near the bottom of the old jeep road, you will encounter a maze of trails with several options for returning to the old highway.  Keep on an established trail and watch out for mountain bikers. After reaching the old highway, turn right to return to your car. CAUTION: There is poison oak along the Labyrinth trail. Know what it looks like, dress appropriately, and watch what you touch. Don’t let this deter you from taking this wonderful hike, however.WTA Pro Tip: A perfect way to end your Coyote Wall experience is to stop in Stevenson Washington for a snack or dinner at the Walking Man Brewery or the Big River Grill.The Walking Man Brewery serves a wide variety of their own brews along with sandwiches and gourmet pizzas (these are especially good). Plus, the outdoor seating area allows you to continue your commune with nature.  This is odd advice, but be sure to check out the décor of the restrooms.If you’d like a more upscale dining experience, go to the Big River Grill which features Northwest Cuisine using fresh local ingredients.  With its license plate collection and Columbia River sturgeon mermaid, the food is Portland-good and the atmosphere roadhouse quirky."

Thompson Lake provides a great destination for day hikers or overnighters in the Alpine Lakes Wilderness. You may even find solitude here, just off the I-90 corridor. But that solitude comes at a price. The trail up to Mount Defiance can be trying, especially in the height of summer. Climbing moderately, and then steeply away from Mason Lake, hikers are eventually rewarded with fields full of flowers and a gorgeous panorama from the summit of Defiance. But at the end of the traverse just below the summit, a little bootpath descends quietly into the forest. This is the trail to Thomspon Lake: a large, scenic lake with nice alpine boulder fields and great views of the interior of Alpine Lakes Wilderness and Pratt river valley. Here, a number of small forested islands catch the sunlight in morning and evening, providing a relaxing panorama if you've chosen to camp. From the traverse on Defiance, follow the narrow, somewhat brushy trail over to the north side of Defiance Ridge. 2.6 miles of ridgeline traverse bring you to yet another backbone, where you may be able to spot Spider Lake and creek in the basin to the southeast. But you're heading to the northwest. Thompson Lake lies at the base of several steep switchbacks, just 0.8 miles away. The lake has some good campsites. The main area is across the inlet stream just after you cross the stream on some logs when you finally get down the switchbacks. The trail around the lake passes a junction with trail 1009A and 0.3 miles past that junction are some smaller sites.

This five day, four night adventure begins at the 4,800 foot-high Billy Goat Trailhead. The trail starts climbing at the start, reaching the treed Billy Goat Pass at 6,600 feet. Drop down the pass to an avalanche-scoured meadow complete with friendly marmots likely sunning themselves on gigantic boulders. Campsites dot the trail every so often, but you’re journey has just begun.In 2.2 miles you’ll reach a junction at 5,700 ft. Stay straight and continue walking steadily uphill toward the unique Three Fools Pass. This pass is among the most fascinating you may visit, the apex narrowly sitting in a slot between two ridges. In another 2.2 miles you’ll meet a junctions with the Diamond Creek trail, stay on the Larch Creek trail and cross Diamond Creek. As you climb out of the creek bed, views will open up to the west and treat you to stately nearby peaks. Proceed another 2.5 miles to a nice campsite along Larch Creek.Day two takes you into the sublime high country! As Larch Pass is conquered the views open up. Soon  you climbing flower strewn McCall Gulch, approximately 4 miles from the previous night’s campsite. At the top of McCall Gulch you’ll reach the 7,500 ft trail highpoint. Rest here, soaking in the views. Looking north you can see your route along the bottom of Sand Ridge. The next 3.7 miles provide you with babbling brooks, possible late-melting snow patches, and finally larch at Peeve Pass, your home for the next two nights.Day three is the “choose you own adventure day” – there are many options from Peeve Pass and they are all wonderful! Here are some ideas:• Hike to Ramon Lakes via Park Pass, nearly touching the Canadian border. Either hike back the way you came or for a more adventurous trip, finish the loop past the Sheep Lake trail. Note that the trail is faint in places as it crosses meadows, but the route-finding isn’t too difficult.• Swim in Quartz Lake contained in a cirque below Quartz Mountain.• Scramble up 8,274 ft Sheep Mountain – off trail experience needed. 360 degree views abound for miles upon miles.• Wander through pretty Whistler Basin via the unmaintained Sand Ridge Trail.• Ramble along the top of Sand Ridge using the way trail near Peeve Pass. You could even make a loop trip out of it by revisiting the 7,500-foot pass at the top of McCall Gulch.On day four, wake up and wave goodbye to the Pasayten high country. Head back the way you came, spending night four at the same camp as night one. On day five, hike out and consider the trip a success!WTA Pro Tip: There are great dispersed camping options and campgrounds along Eightmile Creek and Chewuch River roads.

As far as miles per hour goes, Aasgard may be one of the slowest hikes you attempt. Achieving the pass is a thigh-burning, chest-bursting, eye-popping endeavor that offers as many extraordinary views as beads of sweat that will fall  from your brow as you ascend nearly 2000 feet in just three-quarters of a mile. From Colchuck Lake, a trail has been tramped out by the hundreds of feet that head up and over Aasgard Pass each year. While it’s relatively evident to those familiar with route-finding, this is not the trail for folks new to hiking, no matter your level of fitness. You’ll need route-finding experience, agility, and excellent balance. Those lucky enough to score a permit for the Core Zone should consider these factors when you’re thinking about heading in over Aasgard Pass for an overnight. While it may be considerably shorter mileage-wise, the trail up Aasgard can be treacherous if your center of balance is compromised by a pack loaded with overnight gear. Rock-hopping around the head of Colchuck Lake gives way to a trail with a staircase-like grade. Further on, sections of scrambling are required to ultimately access the coveted Core Zone. The pass viewed from the lake is not the real top of the pass but instead a false summit, with even more elevation gain to be had before gaining the pass.But once you’re atop the pass, the striped rocks, gleaming snow, jagged peaks, and icy lakes that lie before you make it seem like you’re in another world--even on another planet. The basin is so huge that other hikers seem like little ants below you at Isolation Lake, and sound is quickly absorbed into the air around you, giving the impression of solitude despite the fact that you’re probably sharing the basin with at least a few other people. At 7800 feet, it seems like you’re on top of the world, though Dragontail Peak rises above to the west and a large ridgeline looms overhead to the east. WTA Pro Tip: Many people attempt the Enchantments as a one-day traverse, departing from the Lake Stuart trailhead and making the Snow Lakes trailhead their destination. If this is your goal, leave early! Hiking up Aasgard Pass is tiring, but doing so in the heat of the day (between 11am and 3pm) is even worse, and once you arrive at the pass, you still have 15 miles of trail to negotiate before arriving at Snow Lake trailhead. The sooner you can get Aasgard over with, the more time you’ll have to enjoy your route out of this singular landscape."

If it’s the barrier-free loop you’re after, take the exit off Hwy 504 for the Seaquest State Park Visitors Center. Drive through the first large parking lot and park in the second large lot. The trail is marked by a large kiosk with information about wildlife in the area and a map of the route that the trail takes through the lush marshy Silver Lake. The graveled trail is almost totally flat, descending about five feet from the parking lot via a gentle switchback on the west end of the loop before becoming boardwalk. Mount St. Helens is visible from most of the trail, commanding the vista despite—or perhaps because of—her imperfect summit. Wildlife abounds here, even in winter, and the boardwalk and raised trail that carries you through Silver Lake puts you up close and personal with the flora and fauna supported by this huge lake–-one of the largest ecosystems of its kind in the western United States. Kids will love this easy hike, and, when open, the visitors center makes an excellent supplement to your outside explorations.If the mile-long loop wasn’t quite enough for your venturesome self, take the tunnel under the road and the trail up into the camping and day-use area. There is a maze of trails here, offering everything from a quarter-mile loop around the campgrounds to a mile-long perimeter hike of the forest to the north of the campgrounds and yurts. The trails here are easy enough to follow, if somewhat poorly signed, so be sure you have a map of your own, or plenty of time for doubling back. Towards the far reaches of the trail system, the trails cross several small creeks and incorporate stairs and short, steep climbs, making for a more rugged experience. WTA Pro Tip: If some of your party is keen to explore the trails but others don’t want to make the trek, a playground at the center of the campground makes a great meeting spot."

From June through September, it gets thousands--maybe tens of thousands--of hiker visits.  But those who take the time to check avalanche snow conditions and closely monitor avalanche dangers can find a safe time to trek this route. The route begins by heading to Source Lake (Route 49), but pushes on past that easy-to-reach day-hiking destination and climbs steeply to crest the saddle separating Snow Lake from the Snoqualmie River drainage. This makes for a rigorous outing, but one well worth the effort--especially for those seeking a winter camping destination.From Alpental, follow the route to Source Lake (Route 49), staying on the west side of the river basin. From Source Lake, swing north and start climbing the increasingly steep slope below Chair Peak, angling north and east up the slope. At about 3 miles, you'll find the slope tapers off and you enter a broad, tree-dotted meadow atop a broad saddle between Chair Peak and Snoqualmie Mountain. Stop and catch your breath here as you peer out at the surrounding glory. Denny Peak lies to the south, flanked by The Tooth, Bryant Peak, and Chair Peak to the west. To the north, a high ridge links Chair Peak to Snoqualmie Mountain on the northeast, which is in turn flanked by Lundin Peak, Red Mountain, and finally Guye Peak to the southeast.Due north, just a few hundred feet below you, lies the long, flat oval of Snow Lake. You can descend to the lakeshore to find camp, or find a comfortable place to pitch your tent on the ridgeline, where the views are far better. Just find a nice flat in the lee of a stand of trees and you'll be warm and comfy. To continue your outing, and to gain a panoramic view of the basin, head east from the lake and climb to the low ridge above the lake, exploring to your heart's content.Author’s Rating: More DifficultSome previous snowshoe experience helpful. Some winter survival skills recommended (basic knowledge of avalanche evaluation, emergency shelter construction, etc.). Elevation gain is usually less than 1000 feet with a gradual slope."

After 0.4 miles, veer left on Trail 100 as Trail 110 continues uphill towards Saddle Junction. Just past the intersection, the trail crosses a second WTA-built bridge over another tributary of Burping Brook. As you hike, note the springboard slots on 6-foot tall stumps along this portion of the trail, marking a century-old logging operation that may have been part of the effort to rebuild Spokane in the wake of the massive 1889 fire. The trail now meanders along through the deep forest, generally losing elevation over approximately .3 miles to the next intersection. Continue to the right on trail 100 and begin to climb again as the trail contours across the hillside for about a mile, crossing two additional tributaries of Burping Brook, the first crossing of which  received a bridge thanks to WTA work crews in August 2014.Finally, arrive at Smith Gap, where you'll find the new snowshoe warming hut, built by the Friends of Mount Spokane State Park with the help of community grants and donations.

Now, users can follow the Spokane River from Riverside State Park west of Spokane all the way to the Idaho border. With numerous access points along its 37-mile length (WA & ID), there is plenty to see along this casual route created by the combination of converted roadway, former timber company lands and old railway routes. Start by exploring the first two miles of trail (I-90 at exit 299) and the darker history of the region at the Horse Slaughter Camp monument, site of the 1858 slaying of more than 700 Native American horses along the banks of the river. Next, pick up the Centennial Trail at the trailhead for the Denny Ashlock Bridge along Upriver Drive in the Spokane Valley. Cross the bridge and explore the trail east, with views upstream of Antoine Peak. The mansion at the top of the cliff is the former Royal Newton Riblet Mansion, now the Arbor Crest Winery. A mile upstream from the bridge, look for the statue of Antoine Plante on the far bank; this is the location where Plante operated his ferry across the Spokane River from the 1850s until the 1870s, and where the historic Mullan Trail crossed the Spokane River. The best of the Centennial Trail can be found at the western end where it crosses into Riverside State Park. Create loops by connecting the Centennial Trail to the Riverside State Park trail system. From the Wilbur Trailhead, follow the Centennial Trail upstream to the former camp of the Civilian Conservation Corps, now an interpretive site. Or continue on the highway to Nine Mile Bridge to access the Carlson Road Trailhead near milepost 36, and follow the trail a mile upstream to the impressive rock formations of Deep Creek Canyon. And no trip to the Centennial Trail is complete without exploring its urban core. Explore the site of the 1974 World’s Fair.

While it may lack the elevation of Mount Spokane, it more than makes up for it with superior views; pack a picnic lunch and take advantage of the outstanding vista. As dense forest yields to the summit area's  open meadows and spectacular old growth trees, one can view Newman Lake and spot Antoine Peak Conservation Area to the southeast. To the south, the Foothills Community shows off its agricultural roots in the early to late summer with checkerboard fields of green pasture grass and alfalfa hay fields interspersed with bright yellow canola fields and golden wheat plantings. To the west lies Chattaroy, with additional farm land broken up by larger patches of timber. To the north, one can see the southern peaks of the Selkirk Range, while to the northeast, Mount Spokane's forested backside and bald pate dominates the view. From the summit of Mount Kit Carson, Trail 160 continues along the northern flank of the peak, allowing one to extend the hike to the saddle between Mount Kit Carson and Day Mountain where it intersects Trail 130. This is a good option for anyone looking to bag two peaks for the price of one. Since Trail 160 is only accessed via other park trails rather than having its own trailhead, there are several options available for where to begin one's hike. The shortest option is to begin at the Cook's Cabin trailhead along the summit road. From the trailhead, cross the road and begin the hike along the Upper Mount Kit Carson Loop Road, a former auto route that's now converted to park trail. Consider stopping at the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) Cabin to admire the historic site and artistic rock work (interpretative signs will be installed during the summer of 2014). From this trailhead it's one mile to Saddle Junction and the Trail 160 intersection. Another potential starting point for this hike is the switchback parking lot at the Lower Mount Kit Carson Loop Road. The longer approach via Trail 110 to Saddle Junction allows one to ascend through some of the most spectacular bear grass displays in the park, and offers the potential to find huckleberries beginning in August. At the top, catch your breath and take in the all-encompassing views.  The valleys may be shrouded in their layer of fog, but up here, the sun is generally shining.  When the fog is absent, look east to pick out Idaho lakes (Hauser), Washington lakes (Newman), the communities from Coeur d'Alene all the way to the city of Spokane, plus Chattaroy to the northwest and the Selkirk Mountains to the north before returning to Saddle Junction and trail 140.WTA Pro-Tip: This year-round trail is shared with snowmobile use during the winter, and the summit and meadows area of Mount Kit Carson is a designated off-trail snowmobile ""play area."" Be aware of this as you travel here in the winter months. Note: Trail 160 between Saddle Junction and the summit of Mount Kit Carson is scheduled to be rerouted during the summer of 2014. Watch for signs regarding trail work."

Watch for the signs for the CCC cabin, then turn right and head uphill. Though it's not the original, the cabin sits on the site of what was voted the nation's best CCC camp.  It later became the park headquarters, and now offers winter visitors a chance to warm up before retracing the route back to the trailhead.**Note that in winter this route requires a Sno-Park pass, as all of Mount Spokane is considered a SnoPark. Those who use the groomed trails need to purchase a special groomed trails sticker in addition to the regular SnoPark permit; this includes snowmobiles who use the lot below Selkirk, and anyone who parks in the Selkirk Lot.  Snowshoeing is not allowed on Nordic trails (or in the Alpine ski area), but even snowshoers using trails near Selkirk Lodge need to have the extra sticker on their permit."

The trails are wide and inviting and several lead to south-facing prairie balds where the wildflowers are abundant in the spring. Three different beaches are also accessible by the trail system, providing ample opportunities for picnicking and enjoying the sun.To enjoy pebbly shorelines, follow the trails from the dock either to Sunrise Beach on the east side or Sunset Beach on the west side. If you diverge to the right on the Sunrise Beach Trail and slight right two more times, you’ll arrive at Paintbrush Point Overlook about a mile from the dock on the south side of the island.During the spring and summer especially, the grasslands on Vendovi blossom with camas, paintbrush, fawn lilies and other wildflowers. Because the island is relatively untouched, it is also home to sea birds, eagles, seals, river otters and squirrels. Many people have fallen for Vendovi Island’s charms; you are invited to see these charms for yourself!Note that while there is no pass required for this hike, groups of 10 or larger will need to contact the caretakers of the island in advance."

The lush riparian vegetation of cottonwoods, aspens, water birches, willows, oaks, and deciduous shrubs is as colorful as anything you’ll find anywhere—and a fantastic location for fall photography. This gentle trail follows the south side of the Tieton River from the Oak Creek Wildlife Area Visitor Center. To access the better part of the trail, drive 3 miles past the visitor center to a large pullout—make sure to display your Discover Pass. Cross the river on a footbridge to connect to the trail, and turn left. The route cuts across the hillside directly above the river, then drops into a giant meadow ringed with cottonwoods, Garry oaks, aspens, red-osier dogwoods and wild roses.Leaving the meadow behind, the trail winds up and down through the floodplain, immersed in lush riparian vegetation. At just the right time of fall, this portion of the trail can be an ever-shifting kaleidoscope of yellow, gold, bronze, maroon, red, orange and green. After about 1.5 miles, the trail reaches a suspension bridge and shortly beyond climbs to a broad sagebrush flat. The next 1.8 miles to the visitor center winds through dry sagebrush, away from the river. The lack of color through this section is compensated by the awesome views of the Royal Columns, dramatic cliffs of columnar andesite popular with local rock climbers.

A wide, gurgling blue creek. Deep, emerald-green lakes. Towering mountains and vast meadows of desert wildflowers. All await you here.At 17,000 acres, the state-owned Crab Creek Wildlife Area is bigger than some federal wilderness areas in Washington State. What's more, the area is just as rich in wildlife and natural habitat as many wildernesses. Crab Creek also has the distinction of being the longest creek in the United States, and the fact that much of it is protected as wildlife habitat makes it wonderfully special.After just 0.5 mile of hiking, you'll find the railroad grade of the old Chicago/St. Paul/Milwaukee Railroad. The two trestles near the access point for this route mark the start of a great adventure. Once on the railroad route, hike west along the old rail corridor as it passes through the marshlands of the Lower Crab Creek area. The sloughs and ponds along the creek sport lovely crops of swaying cattails and silky marsh reed grasses. These marshy bogs provide fertile habitat for a variety of animals, too. During one visit, we counted no less than five species of waterfowl, two belted kingfishers, and a squadron of great blue herons flying by. Red-winged blackbirds call from the reeds, and a few yellow-headed blackbirds are also in the area.At about a mile out from the vehicle, drop off the rail corridor and freely roam around, over, and between lovely miniature coulees within the vast Crab Creek Coulee. Many wildlife paths weave through the area, and following these always leads to an adventure. If nothing else, they'll lead you to a cool watering hole or a fast route back to the higher slopes above the rail grade.After exploring the southern edge of the creek basin near the rail grade, wander north across the mile-wide coulee to explore the red cliffs of the coulee. The iron-rich cliffs are remarkably beautiful--the rust-stained rock proves rich in lichen, providing a fantastic mosaic of color to view and photograph.From about 2.5 miles out, pick a path up the modest slope--an easy stand-up scramble for the most part--and in less than a mile, you'll find a wonderful high viewpoint from where you can admire the entire sprawl of the wildlife area and, to the south of it, the long line of Saddle Mountain."

From the fire-lookout cabin atop the heather-carpeted peak you can scan the horizon in every direction, picking out peaks and valleys throughout the Alpine Lakes Wilderness and south all the way to Mount Rainier (on clear days). The ridges rolling away from Thorp Mountain sport colorful flower meadows, and the blue pool of Kachess Lake sparkles in the deep valley at its foot.Walk around the gate and walk 0.25 mile to a bridge over Thorp Creek.

Keep your eyes wide open and you might spot a lot of wildlife along the lower trail, especially as the path leaves the stands of forest and pops briefly into old, overgrown clear-cuts. These transition zones are popular places for deer to hang out, since they provide good cover (the forest) as well as close proximity to good browse (in the clear-cuts).About 1.5 miles from the gate the trail starts to climb more steeply, angling upward away from the creek. The forest thins with increasing elevation, providing more sun breaks and viewpoints.At nearly 3 miles a small side trail drops 0.5 mile to Thorp Lake. If time permits this makes a nice side trip. Otherwise, continue climbing as the trail sweeps upward around the headwall of the Thorp Valley.At 3.4 miles another junction is reached, this time with the Kachess Ridge Trail. Stay left as this trail angles west around the flank of Thorp Mountain, and in 0.2 mile go right to climb the steep 0.3-mile scramble trail to the top of the mountain and its awesome views.To complete the loop, drop back down the 0.3 mile to the Kachess Ridge Trail and follow it northeast along No Name Ridge for 1.5 miles.

The Dune Forest Loop is a great introduction to these wildlife-rich habitats. And if you're looking for a good winter hike in the region, this loop isn't subject to the flooding that keeps the coastal trails under water for half the year.Start your loop by heading left (west) on the Red Trail, also known as the Dune Forest Loop. Solid tread soon yields to loose sand, slowing your momentum. In 0.5 mile come to a junction with the Blue Trail, which leads 0.8 mile to the Pacific.

Along the way you'll enjoy a ramble along the river, impressive geologic formations, and relative solitude. The trail is best walked in the spring for wildflowers and in the fall for some of the most spectacular fall color you’ll ever see. It’s also a nice snowshoe or cross-country ski in the winter when there is snow on the ground. From the Visitor Center, cross the highway, take the bridge across the river, and turn right through the gate in the elk fence. Inhale the heady scent of multiple wildflowers if they're out, and take note of the Garry oak trees with woodpeckers perched in them. Be wary of ticks and rattlesnakes as you hike, but don't let your awareness distract you from enjoying the beautiful flowers and views of the river that keep you company on this gently graded trail.  The first 1.8 miles of the trail to the suspension bridge winds through sagebrush flats below the spectacular Royal Columns, dramatic cliffs of columnar andesite popular with local rock climbers. If scaling basalt walls isn't on your schedule, continue on the path that parallels the river, passing more signs that indicate some of the climbing routes on the cliffs. These are closed seasonally for nesting birds of prey. From the suspension bridge, the trail makes its way up and down through the flood plain, immersed in the lush riparian vegetation of cottonwoods, aspens, garry oaks, willows, red-osier dogwood, and wild rose. After about a mile the trail enters a large meadow with a couple of big ponderosa pines and a giant oak tree in the middle. After crossing the meadow, the trail climbs a little and then cuts across the hillside directly above the river to the upper footbridge. From the footbridge the trail continues to contour above the food plain for another mile or so to a large, flat peninsula with nice views up and down the Tieton River Canyon.

Amazing views can be had from high up, from the Seattle area to the beginnings of Snoqualmie Pass.The Precipice Top trail is a short connector that WTA has recently worked on, rerouting it off of private property and making it more conveniently accessed for the public. From the Precipice Top trail, hikers can access Big Tree Ridge Trail, the Red Cedar Trail, and lots of the other trails that Cougar Mountain has to offer. Loop options exist, or a simple out and back can be a great way to escape to the forest, just a for moment."

Over the entire trail length, the elevation gain is less than 300 feet. Walking ease doesn't correspond to a lack of interesting sights, though. The best and most dominant feature of this hike is the ever-beautiful Clear Fork of the Cowlitz River and the smaller Little Lava Creek on the other side of the valley. We enjoy simply listening to the river; watching the cold, clear water roll over the rocks; admiring the thirsty wildlife that gathers on its shores; or casting a fly into the river and feeling the raw energy of the strong, toothy trout that prowl the icy pools and eddies. In addition to the river, the trail leads to Lily Lake, a small mea-dow tarn that is the favorite haunt of muskrats and mule deer. ""The trail leaves the road-end trailhead and ambles gently east, darting into and out of the forests that line the valley floor. To the north, Highway 12 rides along the valley wall, so you might hear a bit of road noise, but generally the music of the tumbling river drowns out the less pleasant sounds.Walk quietly along this path, and keep kids and dogs close at hand, and you might be surprised at the wildlife you'll find. Despite the proximity to the road, the valley bottom harbors a host of critters. Mule deer and even Rocky Mountain elk thrive here, as well as smaller beasts such as beavers, muskrats, and weasels. Because of the abundance of water, you'll also find a host of birds, both tiny tweeters such as juncos and big, soaring raptors such as redtail hawks and turkey vultures.Lily Lake, at 1.5 miles, makes a fine picnic spot and turnaround point-though, if you want to go farther, the trail stretches on for many more miles, linking up with Clear Lost and other trails leading deep into the Goat Rocks Wilderness."

Before being established as a park and arboretum, the land was the property of the Puget Mill Company. After a final timber harvest in 1896, the land exchanged ownership a number of times before the creation of Washington Park. The overstory that shades and protects the various collections of flora in the park has sprung from saplings and seeds that remained from the mill activity. The public park offers many quiet locations for picnicking or relaxing, as well as a playfield and the Japanese Garden in the southwest corner.

It has one of the best panoramic views of the lakes, snow-capped peaks and glaciers of the North Cascades National Park. The mountain has a very high prominence for its modest elevation: on the list of Washington's most prominent peaks, Ruby Mountain is number 21 with 3888 feet of prominence.The Ruby Mountain trail is only maintained by boots, and is closer to a scramble than a casual stroll on a well-maintained trail. The trail was not officially developed, but unlike most bootpaths, this trail is fairly well-graded. Thanks to the relative popularity of Ruby Mountain, following the trail is doable, but good navigation skills, and a good nose for finding the bootpath are highly recommended.When the National Park was established in 1968, Ruby Mountain was considered for a viewpoint reachable by a tramway. The tramway was intended to allow all visitors of the North Cascades to appreciate the area.  While this would certainly have been a magnificent place to enjoy the scenery, the project was abandoned. Though the project had relatively widespread support, it was delayed due to the high cost. In the meantime, new environmental protection laws had been introduced and the Park Service expected difficulties in complying with this legislation. The cost and the environmental concerns then caused the project to be entirely abandoned. More recently, the Ruby Mountain trail was considered for official maintenance, but an assessment of the impact on the fragile area resulted in a dismissal of this plan as well.The Ruby Mountain trail is located in the Ross Lake National Recreation Area, which means that it is one of the few trails in this area of the North Cascades that can be hiked with a dog. Good campsites are available at Thunder and Fourth of July Camp, but camping is also possible high on the ridge of Ruby Mountain. The Fourth of July Camp has a permanent water source. On top of Ruby Mountain there is snow available throughout the year on the north-east side. This slope still has some glacial remnants as well. If you plan to camp at the top, make sure to bring enough gas in case melting snow is required.During the summer, Ruby Mountain is usually accessed from the Thunder Creek trailhead and the Fourth of July Pass. The trailhead is all the way at the back of the Colonial Creek Campground with an elevation of 1200 feet. The first 4 miles are to Fourth of July Pass, which has a separate guide entry with more details. From the trailhead, the long climb starts gently, with a very minor incline on the trail that runs parallel to the impressive Thunder Creek. After crossing the bridge, the trail runs through Thunder campground, then starts climbing a bit more. Soon there is a clearly indicated intersection with the Panther Creek trail at about 1300 feet that leads to the Fourth of July Pass. More serious climbing begins now, with two series of switchbacks, one right after the intersection, and one when approaching the pass. During the climb occasionally nice views open up on Colonial Peak, Snowfield Peak and the Neve Glacier, and Primus Peak. These views only get better while ascending, but the mountains are beautiful enough that the climb is immediately enjoyable. The climb to the pass crosses a few creeks that may run into late summer, depending on the snowpack.After climbing to 3400 feet, the relatively flat Fourth of July Pass area begins with an intersection of trails to the Fourth of July Camp. This is not the actual pass yet, but the views at this point are the best until much higher on Ruby Mountain. Continue straight towards the pass through a mostly flat, swampy area. This is the point where route-finding is required. The beginning of the Ruby Mountain trail is not clearly marked, and a bit obscured. Fortunately, there is clear landmark: the top of the pass has two small bridges across creeks, first a small one, and second a bridge about 30 feet long. The Ruby Mountain trail begins right before the larger, second bridge, to the left. It is easily recognizable after hiking a few feet down the trail. After a few dozen yards on the trail there is warning sign that the trail is not maintained.The first half mile of the Ruby Mountain trail runs through forest with not much undergrowth, and the trail is fairly easy to follow here. The area does have many blowdowns, but the trees are not that big, so they do not present a problem. Make sure to pay attention to hints of the bootpath. If the bootpath is not visible for more than half a minute, then most likely you’ve lost the trail.At about 4200 feet the trail enters a gully with much more blowdown and less moss, making the trail harder to follow. Pay close attention to hints of the bootpath. At the time of writing, hikers have put single rocks on blowdowns for guidance.The trail eventually enters more open forest with brushy undergrowth and traverses from the west side to the east side of the ridge at 4900 feet. Due to the undergrowth the trail is easier to follow again here, but it is not very wide and the terrain is fairly steep. Poles come in handy here.After a long, well-graded ascent on the east side of the ridge, the sensible grade of the trail is suddenly abandoned and the trail climbs fairly steeply through a more rocky area back to the center of the ridge at 5800 feet. This is where views start opening up really nicely, with particularly nice views of the Neve and Boston Glacier.From the 5800 foot rocky area back on the center of the ridge, hikers have followed multiple bootpaths. The original trail continues straight to traverse the west-side of the ridge, where it becomes a bit more brushy, but the trail remains visible and easily distinguishable. Others have chosen to follow the center of the ridge, which is an easier option in winter and spring.Continuing on the west side of the ridge, a fairly long traverse without switchbacks climbs to 6200 feet, eventually entering a large slope of blueberry bushes, and starts climbing steeply with switchbacks until 6600 feet. The way is still remarkably well graded for a bootpath. And the views from the meadow are stunning, with the most spectacular views on Mounts Baker and Shuksan, Bacon Peak in the northwest and in the southwest, Forbidden Peak, Boston Peak, Bonanza, Mount Logan, and many more peaks and glaciers.At 6600 feet a small flat area interrupts the climbing. The terrain becomes more high alpine here and snow lingers deep into the summer. The 7200-foot ridge of Ruby Mountain is visible from this point, with a steep rock and grass slope between you and victory. Unfortunately, the trail mostly disappears here and the remainder of the climb to 7200 feet is a scramble through the rocks. If no snow needs to be crossed, then it is not a dangerous climb, but the slope does feel a bit exposed. A snow-free climb is normally possible half-way through July.Once you reach the ridge, the fantastic 360 panorama opens up. You can see Jack and Crater Mountain in the northeast, which are particularly beautiful when there is still some snow early in the year. The walk over the ridge has a couple of false summits, but the walk is such a delight that you will wish there were more! Finally, at the peak there is an amazing view of Ross and Diablo Lakes (with strikingly different colors), and virtually every significant peak of the North Cascades. Ruby Mountain has a summit register, and a large radio system used by the rangers of the North Cascades National Park for their operations.For very strong hikers Ruby Mountain is possible as a day-hike, but enjoying the sunrise and sunset from the mountain is a memorable experience, so an overnight is recommended.The trailhead is before the point where SR 20 closes for winter, so it is also possible to climb Ruby Mountain in winter or early spring. In winter some prefer a steep, shorter route straight up from SR 20 using the north-west ridge of Ruby Mountain. The route via the Fourth of July Pass is also possible, but it is then better to simply follow the entire southwest ridge up instead of attempt to follow the trail, which traverses some steeper slopes. For more route information on those options please consult snowshoeing or cross-country skiing guides.No permit or fee is required for entering the Ross Lake National Recreation Area, nor for parking at the trailhead. A free permit is required for backcountry camping, which can be obtained at the Wilderness Information Center in Marblemount. See the National Park Service website for more information on the permits. Dispersed (crosscountry) camping is allowed only on durable surfaces and 1 mile from established campsites.WTA Pro Tip: An alternative route to the Fourth of July Pass would be to start at the other end of the Panther Creek trail from SR-20, but this trail does run through the National Park, so dogs are not allowed. The approach is also about 1.5 mile longer than the approach via the Thunder Creek."

As you walk, look for kayakers or the eponymous ducks paddling about.The trail here is wide and dry, with plenty of room for people and bikes to pass. Walk across a pleasant open forest and cross under Hwy 520, emerging onto a little hillock, where you can access a beach on the large lake, with views of UW stadium. Hang a left onto the Arboretum Waterfront Trail, stopping to take a peek at a map which has the trail's length and a general map of the area laid out for your perusal. Continue down the path, which now skirts the wetlands of Union Bay through a tunnel of vegetation well over six feet tall onto Foster Island. Turnpike and boardwalk are here to keep hikers' feet dry, but the boggy nature of this area means that despite the structures, the trail can be quite muddy, even impassable in high water. If you can get through this section, you'll cross the water on boardwalk and soon arrive on Marsh Island, with views across to the UW campus and boats cruising Union Bay. Lilypads edge the trail here, and you may even see great blue heron fishing nearby. Soon you'll pop out onto dry land near the old site of the Museum of History and Industry (MOHAI).

You're nearly to the end of your walk at this point. Continue just a few hundred more yards until you pop out onto the pavement of E Foster Island Road, just short of where your car is parked outside the Arboretum."

To hike this route, you should be an experienced route finder willing to hike trails less traveled, and prepared for a lonely hike. You may need crampons and ice axe.Why go?  To condition yourself for long miles with significant elevation changes, to experience the difficulty of the Cascade Crest Trail before there was a Kendall Katwalk, or just to see new views.Begin by hiking to Snow Lake. Continue past the camps on the east side of the lake, and at 3.3 miles and 4100 feet, encounter a junction with signs to Gem Lake (left) and Middle Fork Road (right). Go right, on what is more accurately the Rock Creek Trail. The trail quickly narrows and becomes rockier, while puddles and squishy mudholes may linger even in dry weather. The trail drops steadily and steeply across talus and through forest for 3.5 miles and almost 3400 feet. Along the way is a seldom-seen view of Rock Creek, tumbling down a lengthy rock face after its exit from Snow Lake.At 6.8 miles, arrive at a junction with the Middle Fork Trail #1003 and take a right. This section of trail follows an old road, gaining less than 150 feet of elevation over the next three miles.  Water is available between miles seven and eight of your hike, but note that this may be the last easily available water for several miles. Camping is possible near Thunder Creek at 7.8 miles.The key to successfully completing hike is finding the faint, unsigned trail that leaves the Middle Fork Trail for Red Pass.  Nine miles into your hike, you'll find a prominent three-log crossing of Burntboot Creek, which leads to Goldmyer Hot Springs property.  As you stand facing this crossing, a tree behind you is signed for “Burntboot Creek”. To your right is what appears to be a faint trail along the top of a large log that is nearly rotted away. This is the trail you will follow to Red Mountain. It meanders along the creek, then drifts away. At 400 feet from the Burntboot sign is proof that you are on the right trail: two signs on a tree: one forbidding bicycles and the other reading “Trail not maintained beyond this point”.Using route-finding skills, follow the trail as it climbs moderately steeply through lovely old growth forest. Negotiate switchbacks and a few blowdowns as  you gain 3500 feet in just over 4.5 miles. Enjoy the shade for the first two miles, then break out into views seldom seen.At 12 miles from the Snow Lake trailhead, crest over a small pass to an intimidating view of the steep chute leading up to Red Pass. When the snow is melted, switchbacks make this an easy ascent. Earlier, crampons and ice axe may be needed, and a real avalanche danger exists. Know conditions before you go and don't be afraid to turn around if conditions become dangerous.At Red Pass, located at 12.4 miles and 5337 feet, climb left along the ridge top to remain on the Red Pass - Commonwealth Basin Trail. Follow the rocky trail down to the plateau holding Red Pond, then left. Drop to 3875 feet, where your next water stop is available, just under 14 miles from your starting point.At 14.3 miles, go right, where a broken sign on a tree reads “Abandoned”. At 14.5 miles, rock-hop or ford Commonwealth Creek, then cross again on a log bridge at 14.7 miles. At 14.9 miles, take the short side trail to a worthwhile view of a waterfall. Continue down the narrow and brushy trail to connect with the Pacific Crest Trail, then go right the final 100 yards to arrive at the Snoqualmie Pass trailhead. To close the loop, walk pavement downhill to Alpental Road, then right to retrace the driving route to the Alpental parking lot, a total of 1.5 pavement miles."

Begin at Selkirk Lodge, a place that is generally filled past capacity on a sunny weekend during Nordic ski season, but almost always devoid of cars come the warmer months of the year.  Follow any of the Nordic Trails leading out to Nova Hut at Junction 3, passing through second-growth forests on old logging roads that have been converted to one of the state's best Nordic trail systems. Late summer users can expect to find huckleberries and could potentially see resident deer, moose, coyote, or black bear. The trail system here is open to non-motorized multi-use, but is rarely busy.From Junction 3, hikers should follow the Quartz Mountain Loop Trail (part of the Nordic system, and not the same trail as the one leading to the summit of nearby Quartz Mountain, home of a rentable fire lookout cabin). Approximately 1 mile into the hike along the loop, watch for the sign on the right indicating the way to Ragged Ridge.  The trail drops down to a saddle, entering a Natural Forest Area (NFA) and quickly changing from an ecosystem that has been heavily impacted by human use into a near-wilderness. The NFA and Natural Area Preserve (NAP) beyond it are only open to hikers. Respect the special forest and the plant and animal species it protects by following LNT practices.The trail descends to a saddle, where a sign indicates the NAP. It then climbs a series of switchbacks along the lower portion of the ridge before coming out on top, where the views are spectacular in all directions. Look back and note the Quartz Mountain Lookout peeking out above the trees on Quartz Mountain; look to the south to see Newman Lake looking close enough to dive into; to the east, see numerous Idaho Lakes.The trail continues out to the edge of the NAP, where a fence marks a boundary that is slightly on the Idaho side of the border; here is where Mount Spokane State Park crosses state boundaries, even if only a little bit. Turn back here and retrace the route for a round trip hike of 15.1 miles."

In 0.5 mile, Trail No. 44A, a horse trail, meets up with the main trail. In roughly 2 miles from the trailhead, arrive at a very rocky creek crossing, an outlet from Jug Lake above. This creek can by tricky in early season, so proceed with caution by rock hopping or look for a downed log to balance your way across. In late season, the creek is but a trickle. In 0.2 miles beyond the crossing, arrive at Jug Lake Trail No. 43. Turn left (northeast) on it and begin climbing more steeply now, switching up as you go. In 1.2 miles from the Jug Lake trail junction arrive at a junction with Judkin Trail No. 47, which is also signed for Jug Lake with an arrow pointing in the same direction. Oddly, the Jug Lake Trail ends here before the lake and hikers use the Judkin Trail to access the lake. Proceed on the Judkin Trail for 0.3 mile to find the beautiful shores of Jug Lake to the trail’s left. A huge meadow lies just beyond Jug Lake, home to wildflowers and plenty of elk. Older maps show trails through the meadows, leading to other lakes and ridges, but lack of maintenance over the years has made them extremely hard to find and follow. Only attempt to go beyond this point if you are a skilled navigator.WTA Pro Tip: Don’t miss the delicious burgers and milkshakes at Cliff Dropper’s restaurant in Packwood, which hit the spot after a fun trail day!"

Still, the wildlife will tell you it's all okay and they love it here--they appreciate the work being done to preserve the area!Time your visit correctly and you'll find yourself hiking through a corridor lined with 10-foot-tall walls of fragrant wild roses all in bloom. These usually bloom late in spring (mid-May). If the roses aren't in bloom, never fear. You'll be treated to great numbers of red-tailed hawks overhead. Perhaps the mourning doves will be calling from the rose brambles, or countless other birds will be flitting and fluttering throughout the area.The trail leads back along the Yakima River.

Listen especially for warblers and white-crowned sparrows.We flushed multiple groups of mourning doves when we hiked back from the Columbia River through the inland areas of grass and sage. These open prairie lands are prime hunting ground for the resident red-tailed hawks.Hikers can wander along 2 to 3 miles of trails lining the two rivers and the lands between.Note: Until 1997, this area was a convenient illegal dumping ground for thoughtless locals, as well as an unofficial racetrack for off-road vehicle enthusiasts. After that time, huge boulders were put in place to keep vehicles out, and a major cleanup and restoration were initiated.

Here also begins your opportunity for additional side trips: scramble up Bald Mountain or go tag Edds Mountain (6,550 feet) just a couple of miles west.Continue south and pass the intersection with the Barnaby Buttes Trail. All that remains of the old fire lookout are the cement steps and some scattered nails; the side trip is an easy mile. Moving on, cross a small stream (often dry by the end of summer), and pass below the summit of White Mountain. Watch for the spur trail that leads to the summit, the most interesting of all the summits in the Kettle Crest—the lower portion is grassy and flower-covered, while the top consists of rocky, fortress-like outcroppings. The remains of an old fire lookout occupy the southern end. Soak in the view of the surrounding peaks and Lake Roosevelt in the valley far below. Good camps can be found in the trees below the summit, but water in the area is scarce.Big Views:  The Kettle Crest Trail passes just beneath the summits of Sherman and Snow Peaks, Bald Mountain, Barnaby Buttes and White Mountain. 360-degree views include Lake Roosevelt and the Selkirks to the east, Canada to the north and the Cascades to the west."

Adjacent to the trail, watch for rocky mountain junipers popping up among the larger Ponderosa pines and fir trees.For those who would prefer to summit rather than take the round-the-mountain  route, veer left at the intersection and continue uphill just under half a mile. At the second intersection, turn right and continue uphill for a half-mile to the summit; the left- hand trail is the return route for the necklace loop. This route is also frequently traveled by workers accessing the communication towers at the summit, so watch for vehicles along the way.For those who access the property from the east, the route to the summit is currently steeper, although reroutes to the steepest sections are proposed for the summer of 2015. In the meantime, there are several options for ascending the flank of Antione Peak. The trail that leads northwest from the parking area passes Leland Pond en route, offering the best chance for spotting a moose. The trails on this side of the peak follow the small streams that feed the pond, where hikers can view rare Pacific yew trees. Increased moisture on this side of the mountain yields increased diveristy in plant life. In the spring, watch for trillium and shooting stars along  seasonal seeps, giving way to lupine blooms and Indian paintbrush later in the season."

First, the route will take you to Poo Poo Point, a knoll on a shoulder of West Tiger Mountain, for the view and perhaps to see paragliders launching into the sky. Then, you'll continue via a sequence of short trails to reach and traverse all three numbered summits of West Tiger Mountain before returning to your trailhead.From the High Point trailhead on Tradition Plateau, follow the wide graveled trail 0.1 mile south. Pass the signed turnoff to the West Tiger #3 Trail and the Tiger Mountain Trail (TMT,) and follow the wide trail around to the right. In 100 yards cross a small bridge and, 100 feet beyond that, turn left onto the signed Nook Trail.Follow the Nook Trail, at first gently uphill. The trees you pass here, heavily draped with moss, may seem to endow the forest with an ancient quality, but it's all regrowth. Here and there along your route, occasional remnants of huge stumps hint at the truly-ancient forest that once graced these slopes.Your route gradually becomes steeper. At 0.7 miles, take a sharp right turn onto the signed Talus Rocks Trail and, in another 0.25 miles, come to the Section Line Trail. Perversely, the sign there shows only an arrow pointing to the right (downhill, toward the High School Trail.) Ignore that arrow! Take a sharp turn left, uphill, onto the Section Line Trail. In a few feet, pass a sign proclaiming ""Unmaintained Trail,"" which just means that maintenance is done by volunteer crews.The first part of the Section Line Trail may not seem too steep, but that changes. Short sections of the trail are among the steepest in the Tigers. In 0.2 miles come to the first steep section. Beyond that, the grade eases just a bit then reaches another steep section passing around a rocky outcrop.In summer, as you hike parts of the trail where little sunlight reaches the forest floor, look for saprophyte plants such as Indian pipe, coral root and candy stick.Press on, and soon come to the West Tiger RR Grade. (The Section Line Trail continues on to the West Tiger #3 summit, and will provide your return route.) Turn right onto the RR Grade. Most of the grade is nearly level, so this is a chance to catch your breath. In the century since logging trains last puffed along the grade there have been some wash-outs and slides, so expect occasional downs and ups.In 0.3 miles, come to an unsigned trail fork. Take the right fork (the trail heading uphill to the left is the Seattle View Trail that connects with the TMT.)Over the next 1.3 miles, the West Tiger RR Grade traverses Many Creeks Valley, crossing a number of small creeks on bridges constructed in recent years. Some of the creeks are seasonal, others run all year. In summer, some parts of the trail may be overgrown. Come to a three-way trail junction. From the downhill side, the Poo Poo Point Trail arrives from the direction of Issaquah High School. The trail continuing on uphill is the One View Trail, and that will be your route AFTER you have visited Poo Poo Point.For now, continue on the level grade. It changes names, becoming the ongoing part of the Poo Poo Point Trail, and it will take you to the point in 0.5 miles. Soon, drop over 150 feet on switchbacks, then resume a gentle uphill climb to reach Poo Poo Point. (The folksy name is a reference to the steam whistle sounds heard throughout the Tigers in the early days of logging.)Poo Poo Point lies on a shoulder of West Tiger Mountain, and a small knoll there is topped by a mast with a windsock. The knoll is only a few feet higher than the surrounding area, but it qualifies Poo Poo Point - if minimally - as one of West Tiger Mountain's summits. The point offers a great view northwest across Issaquah and Lake Sammamish toward Bellevue's downtown. To the west are Squak and Cougar Mountains, with a hint of Seattle's tallest buildings showing beyond. On a clear day, more distant mountains may be visible.If your timing is right you can enjoy watching paragliders launch into the sky from the steep northwestern face of the point. You also may see hikers at the point who have arrived there via the Chirico Trail.To continue, return to the three-way trail junction and turn right onto the One View Trail. It's mostly uphill, but with an occasional downhill section, including a significant drop into Fifteen Mile Gap (there, streams to your right flow into Fifteen Mile Creek and those to your left into Gleason Creek.) Beyond the Gap, a short climb brings you to a junction with the TMT.Turn right on the TMT and, in 0.1 mile, come to the sign for Larry's Crossing. There, turn left onto the Hidden Forest Trail (Sorry, the most interesting part of the forest is downhill to your right, but that's a different hike.) Follow the Hidden Forest Trail uphill, at first climbing steeply then leveling out. After 0.2 miles from the TMT, cross the Main Tiger Mountain Road (Road 4000,) one of several non-public service roads in the Tigers. Across the road, your trail continues with a new name. It becomes the Poo Top Trail, and follows a ridge leading toward West Tiger #1. As ridges often do, this one has some ups and downs, so accept that your route to West Tiger #1 will cross several false summits.After hiking 0.7 miles beyond the road you do reach the West Tiger #1 summit. It's next to a tower at 2948 feet, and is the second highest point in the Tigers, after East Tiger Mountain (3004 feet.) It's the highest point on your hike today. But it's forested, so you have to go a bit farther for the view.Drop a short distance down the north side of the ridge, on switchbacks, and reach the signed Preston / Bypass Trail. (Names change in the Tigers, and your map may show a different trail name.) Turn sharply left there and continue 0.1 mile through dark forest to reach the Hikers Hut Viewpoint. (The hut itself is a small domed metal structure that might serve as a rudimentary shelter in winter.) Emerge abruptly from the dark forest into the open air and bright sunlight (clouds permitting,) and take a seat on the bench facing Mount Rainier. A swath of the Olympics may be visible too, from Mt. Ellinor at the south end to Mt. Constance as far as you can see around to the north.In season, look for lupine and tall white daisies and, occasionally, tiger lilies. As you sit, you are likely to see humming birds and large dragonflies, and are almost certain to be visited by two or three gray jays hoping to beg a lunch offering. It's a good stopping point, so stay a while and enjoy the view.When you are ready to continue, hike down the service road, dropping 400 feet. Come to a gate adorned with crude metal lettering ""No Trespassing."" That's just meant to discourage unauthorized vehicles, and hikers are welcome to proceed via a trail around the right end of the gate.Continue on the service road, gaining 250 feet, to reach the West Tiger #2 summit. It you are seeking the highest accessible point, take the one minute side trip from the road up to the tower fence and the summit sign. There is not much of a view.Then return to the road and take the signed trail 0.4 miles on to the West Tiger #3 summit, crossing the TMT along the way. There often is a small crowd at West Tiger #3, and folks of all abilities hike to that summit from the north side. A few may have struggled to get there, so it's probably politic not to reveal that it's your fourth summit of the day.Now it's time to descend back to the lowlands. Take the wide trail that leaves the summit toward the northwest. As the trail begins to level out, about 200 feet from the summit, be alert for an unsigned trail heading downhill to your left. That's the upper end of the Section Line Trail. As confirmation, a few feet down the trail come to one of those signs announcing ""Unmaintained Trail.""The footing on the Section Line Trail is not too bad when the trail is slightly moist. But when the trail dries out in summer it becomes gritty, and the small pebbles tend to roll beneath your boots. So watch your step, particularly in the steeper places. Trekking poles are advisable here.Cross over the intersection with the West Tiger RR Grade, completing your loop, and continue on down the Section Line Trail another 0.5 miles. Be alert for the sharp right turn onto the Talus Rocks Trail and, a quarter mile later, for the sharp left turn onto the Nook Trail. Failure to make these turns could take you well out of your way.Once you are back on the Nook Trail, it's an easy descent to Tradition Plateau, where a right turn on that wide graveled trail will take you back to your trailhead.WTA Pro-Tip: The four-summit hike can be done from the High Point Trailhead as described above. Alternatively, with minor variations, your hike can begin and end with the High School Trail, or with the Chirico Trail. Each option takes you to the same four summits in the same order, and includes the West Tiger RR Grade. Check the Green Trails Map 204S and, for additional details, refer to the hike descriptions for the Poo Poo Point hike, or the Poo Poo Point - Chirico Trail hike.Directions via the High School Trail: Park south of Issaquah High School and take the High School Trail to the lower end of the Section Line Trail. Hike the Section Line Trail, passing the intersection with the Talus Rocks Trail, and continue on to the West Tiger RR Grade. Proceed as above. On your return from West Tiger #3, take the Section Line Trail all the way down to the High School Trail, and return to your trailhead.Directions via the Chirico Trail: Park at the paraglider landing field next to Issaquah-Hobart Road and hike the Chirico Trail to Poo Poo Point. Take the Poo Poo Point trail to the three-way trail junction and turn right onto the One View Trail. Proceed as above. On your return from West Tiger #3, descend the Section Line Trail as far as the West Tiger RR Grade, turn left and follow the grade back to the three-way trail junction. Continue on to Poo Poo Point, and return to your trailhead via the Chirico Trail."

It's a quiet, little known and infrequently visited spot, less than an hour's drive from Seattle.From the parking area, walk pass the gate and follow the logging road down into the valley of Stossel Creek. The road appears to be well used, although I didn't see any activity on the Saturday when I walked it. Be prepared for log trucks if you visit during the week. The Stossel Creek valley is forested and peaceful, the only sound accompanying you is the soft rush of the creek below. Birds love the wetlands along the floor of the valley. In a half mile the road crosses the creek and after a short distance begins a steep climb out of the valley. Just before the climb, note a path branching right and heading south along the valley floor. This path is an old road, well worth following as it soon reaches the placid waters of Swan's Mill Pond, and follows the east shore. The path eventually reaches a lovely flat area on the shore of the pond, next to a jumble of mossy boulders. On a clear day, the lake reflects the low winter sun onto this spot, creating a pleasant oasis of warmth. The perfect spot for a picnic! From here,the path continues heading south to the old dam that forms the lake, then crosses the creek. At high water, this crossing can be tricky: you have a choice of wading the creek or scrambling across a jumble of wet, slimy logs. If you do make it across, the path reaches the Tolt Pipeline Trail after one-third of a mile.Instead of crossing the creek, you may choose to return to the first road, following it out of Stossel Creek valley. This road gradually climbs up a quiet side-valley, passing through logged forest in various states of regrowth. Some recently logged areas are visible, but these are generally tasteful, selective cuts that aren't too ugly. About a mile from Stossel Creek, the road reaches a high point and a junction. Leave the main road here, and follow a gated, little-traveled road southward. This road's mossy surface is pleasant to walk on. It meets up with a junction of Tolt Pipeline Trail in a mile. Along the way, you get glimpses of snowy Cascade peaks. Just before the Tolt Pipeline junction, another overgrown-looking road branches right. If you are adventurous, you might try hiking this road instead of slogging along the Tolt Pipeline Trail.Beyond The Tolt Pipeline is the start of yet another road, next to a chain link fence. This road may take you to the Old Swimming Hole on the Tolt River.The Tolt Pipeline Trail extends for miles, and comprises a grassy strip and narrow paved road occupying a wide swath in the forest. A wood fence separates the grass from the road. Hikers are supposed to walk on the grass and stay off the road, but the grass is frequently lumpy and muddy, so you will be tempted to walk on the road anyway. Traffic on the road is almost nil on weekends (only service vehicles with permits can use it), so there seems to be little risk in doing so.If you head east on the Tolt trail, in a mile you will reach a bridge over the Tolt River. Beyond the bridge, the pipeline corridor is not open to the public. Heading west, the Tolt Pipeline trail will take you back in a mile to Stossel Creek, the path dropping steeply as the valley is approached. A large marsh occupies the floor of the Stossel Creek valley, another great bird watching area. Just beyond the marsh, look for the a trail on the north side, marked by a trampled path heading up a bank, a blue ribbon, and some boulders. This will take you back to Swan's Mill Pond and your car.Another trail branches off, which provides more hiking possibilities. One branch of this road passes Beaver Lodge Lake before rejoining the Tolt Pipeline about one mile west of this point. Give it a try!"

This paved trail takes you through wetlands, around ponds, and across a natural habitat undergoing restoration. Within minutes you can leave city life behind and be immersed in picture-perfect scenery accompanied by the sound of birds. The trail is easily accessible, making it a perfect quick get-away.Start at the trailhead on NW 36th Avenue and head east on the 10-foot wide multipurpose trail. There is a steep decline at the beginning, but the trail is essentially flat from there on. Right from the start you will be treated by the beauty of Salmon Creek as it meanders through wetlands. The sounds of traffic are quickly replaced by bird songs.  Watch for duck and heron, and be sure to look for the wood duck boxes in the trees along the trail. Wood ducks are an essential part of wetland preservation and restoration. Female wood ducks typically build their nests in tree cavities but will also use nesting boxes. After 1.5 miles, you will come to a trail junction. This makes a good turnaround point if you would like a shorter hike. Otherwise, go left and follow the trail as it traverses a habitat enrichment project designed to bring salmon back to Salmon Creek. Keep left whenever you come to a trail junction.  At 2.5 miles, you will come to a trail junction near a softball sports complex. This makes a good turnaround point unless you would like to use the restrooms on the east side of the fields.NOTE: If you’d like a more handicap friendly walk, you can access the Salmon Creek Trail from Salmon Creek Park or the softball field parking lot, both off NE 117th Street."

You can check out a natural rock arch, see a variety of terrain, take in sweeping views of the Columbia River, and enjoy early-spring wildflower displays.Begin at the Catherine Creek trailhead. The trail takes off on the north side of the road; go around the green gate then go right on the primitive road marked “021.” After a short distance on exposed bedrock, the road veers to the left and down into a ravine to follow Catherine Creek. As you near the creek, there is grassy road taking off to the left. Stay right and cross the creek on a plank bridge. After the creek crossing, the road enters a park-like setting with Catherine Creek on the left and the basalt wall of the canyon on the right. You will soon come to an abandoned cattle chute on the left and the base of the natural arch on the right. Be sure to take pictures of the arch from several viewpoints to get the most dramatic images. The road heads uphill after leaving the arch. The best views will be behind you, so occasionally turn around to enjoy them.  The road forks after going into the woods from a grassy area. Go to the right and follow the road as it nears power lines. Under the power lines you will come to a U.S. Forest Service trail off to the right Leave the road and take the trail uphill.

There are alternative hikes in the area, and the trail to the twin cascades of Hardy and Rodney Falls is hands down the best option.From the lower trailhead, start off hiking on a wide path through tall trees and mosses, accompanied by twittering, flitting songbirds. Most of the elevation gain is in the first mile, until you come to a junction with another trail. This one comes in from the campground at the end of the road you drove in on. This route adds about .20 miles to your hike, a good option for anyone wanting the views of the falls with less of the elevation gain. After the junction, the trail flattens out and traverses through more forest, passing small creeks and cascades that provide excellent photography opportunities. At about a mile and a half, hikers will hear Hardy and Rodney Falls, but two bridge crossings over smaller cascades come first. Take time to see how high up these little waterfalls go -- you will be surprised and impressed. Rounding the corner, you'll encounter a junction heading down to an overlook of Hardy Falls. There are two viewing platforms, both offering gorgeous views of the mighty falls. Be careful on the trail on the way down -- when it is wet, the mud can be slippery. These are likely picnic areas, if you don't mind sitting down on the platform, though there is one small bench available as well. After soaking in the view of Hardy Falls, head back up to the original trail. Cross a bridge built by DNR work crews, and continue just a few yards up the trail to Rodney Falls. Here the trail splits. Head down and to the right to continue across a wide bridge at the base of thundering Rodney Falls. This is the Hamilton Mountain trail, and heads up to a loop around the summit crown of the mountain. If you don't have the time, energy, or desire to continue, the trail up and to the left brings you to the Pool of Winds in just a few hundred feet. This spur trail ends on the rock just adjacent to the first tier of Rodney Falls, where hikers can bask in the spray from the falls and peer into the splash pool, all behind the safety of a handrail. In particularly high water, it may be impossible to get all the way to the Pool of Winds viewpoint, but usually this is a great diversion for hikers of all ages, and provides and excellent reward and rest stop before turning around and heading back down the trail.WTA Pro Tip: A CCC-built shelter is available on a first-come, first-serve basis with four outlets, overhead light, two wood stoves, and three picnic tables; perfect for a birthday party or reunion!"

Cross the main road and take Trail 130a as it runs more or less parallel to the summit road. Pass the park’s maintenance facility and climb to an intersection with B-29 Trail in the Alpine Ski area; Trail 130 joins the cat track for a short segment before veering left and climbing to Bald Knob Campground and picnic shelter.

It's amazing there aren't more hikers sunning themselves on this Nason Ridge summit. And being on one of the area's first high peaks to shed its winter snows, Alpine Lookout makes for an excellent early summer adventure. But a few blemishes make this well-esteemed hike less than perfect. The first 1.6 miles are quite steep. The next 3 miles are open to motorcycles.

Get an early start, pack plenty of water, and avoid busy weekends.Start hiking via the Round Mountain Trail, immediately climbing, and steeply.

Nuthatches and woodpeckers busily grocery shop up and down their weathered and withered trunks.Enjoy views southeast over waves of forested ridges resembling the Blue Ridge Mountains of the American Southeast.

Note that while most motorcyclists stick to the trail, a few renegades have veered off, leaving ugly scars in the fragile forest floor. Frustrating and disheartening.

Undulating between forest and meadow, the trail reaches an elevation of 5600 feet before dipping to a small saddle (elev. 5450 ft).Regain elevation lost and then some, following tread that at times is deeply eroded (blame the motorcycles). At 3.7 miles reach another small saddle, and then round a small knoll before emerging on a broad ridge. More meadows! More views! Gently climbing, the trail rounds yet another knoll (elev. 6100 ft) before dropping a couple hundred feet to rocky Ninemile Saddle at 4.5 miles. Overhanging and balancing rocks add intrigue to this rugged spot. Motorcycles are barred from continuing farther, but you aren't. Carry on, making one last climb.Come to a signed junction. The main trail heads left to the high hinterlands of Nason Ridge. Take the spur right, reaching the Alpine Lookout after 0.3 mile. One of only a handful of lookouts still staffed in the Cascades, there's a good chance a real live lookout may be present.But you have some looking out to do too. The views are amazing from this 6237-foot knob: Straight down to Lake Wenatchee and the oxbowing White River flowing into it. South to Big Jim, Snowgrass, Rainier, and Stuart. West to Hinman, Daniel, Jim Hill, Rock, Mastiff, and Howard. North to Sloan, the Poet Ridge, Buck, and Glacier. And east to the Entiat and Chelan ranges and the ""rock chimneys"" of Chiwawa Ridge. What a panorama! Hang around late in the day or arrive early in the morning, and perhaps you'll share this alpine splendor with the resident mountain goats."

Scattered mossy cedar stumps are telltale signs that long ago the area was once partially logged. Joyfully, a lovely forest remains. This gentle trail makes it easy to slow down and enjoy the stately stands of Douglas-fir and cedar as well as to spy eagles, or perhaps an occasional coyote. The loop is best done by heading north from the trailhead, where it follows an old roadbed through grand bigleaf maples before veering onto a terrace sprinkled with sky-scraping conifers. The trail skirts the edge of the terrace while wandering between giant volcanic boulders, reminders that Glacier Peak is just upriver. After a half mile the trail begins a short descent through a mixed alder forest to the river and a viewpoint. Back on the terrace, the trail continues by dipping down and crossing a small seasonal creek, then passing above a man-made fish channel. Here you can observe the wondrous works of beavers, and maybe even catch them in action. The hike back to the trailhead is a short quarter-mile from the channel.

They're legendary here in May and June.From behind a gate, pick up the trail and make a choice. Beeline straight for the river or take the longer, more scenic route? I thought you'd choose the latter. Turn left and amble through open forest of pine and fir, gently descending 50 feet or so to the Wenatchee River. Now turn right and head upriver. Nason Creek drains into the Wenatchee along this stretch. In spring the flow is quite intense.

Continue straight along the river, passing two spur trails leading to campground loops. At 1 mile arrive at a beautiful beach at the lake's outlet. A small wooded island guards the outflow. Huge cedar driftwood logs litter the beach. The view uplake to Dirtyface Peak, Nason Ridge, and Labyrinth Mountain is a classic. It's partially captured on Washington's special state parks license plate. Winds often whip here, funneling down from the glacially carved valley that houses the 2500-acre lake. The lake is fed by glaciers too-wade if you dare.Continue past the beach and another campground spur, meandering through pleasant forest along the lakeshore. At 1.5 miles come to a junction.

This is largely because of difficulty in accessing it, but if you make the effort, you won't be sorry!If you don't own a boat to get to the island, you can take advantage of a chartered boat or a long kayak trip from Orcas Island. Note that because there is no dock, any craft that approaches it must dock on shore, and the cove has strong currents, which can make docking difficult if you find either of the two moorage buoys unoccupied.If you can overcome these obstacles, you'll find several paid camping spots with grated fire pits and pit toilets.

This elevation gives hikers awe-inspiring views of the water through droves of deep red Pacific Madronas.As you approach the northwest tip of the island, the dirt path gives way to cracked concrete, where a grass field separates a lighthouse from the dense woods. There is six-foot tall grass on either side of the path, giving the area a distinct feeling of solitude and peacefulness. Once you reach the lighthouse, the tall rows of grass give way to a manicured lawn.

When the trail forks, take the trail to the left on up the mountain. This trail eventually doubles back and intersects a road. You may go to the right about 100 feet and pick up the Stump Fiesta trail to the monument, or you may go left down the road and pick up the Stump Fiesta trail after about 0.3 mile.

There are many muddy areas on the trails, but all can be avoided easily by walking alongside the path. Spring and fall are a good time to come, before the mountain bikers descend on the area.WTA Pro-Tip: Be aware that you will likely be sharing the trails with stock and mountain bikes, as this area is multi-use.

Campers overran Shoe Lake in the 1980s, and the fragile meadows around the pond were crisscrossed with social trails and dotted with bare-earth tent sites. In the years since camping has been prohibited, the vegetation has slowly recovered, though faint trails still show through the wildflowers. This trail which runs along Hogback Mountain is a classic example of what most folks think of when they hear Pacific ""Crest"" Trail-a faint footpath through alpine meadows hugging the side of a knife-edged ridge.The Pacific Crest Trail angles southeast for the first 2.5 miles, skirting the edge of the White Pass Ski Area. This initial section climbs modestly through open pine forests, gaining 1000 feet in those 2.5 miles, to a junction with the Three Peaks Trail. There, our route bears west and the forests open even more, as the trail weaves between sun-dappled woods and sun-filled meadows. At 3.5 miles, a short spur trail leads north to the top of the ski lifts. The PCT, though, continues southwest along the east flank of Hogback Mountain.This remnant of the once-great Goat Rocks Volcano is a jagged peak with long, knife-sharp ridges leading north and south from the summit. The trail hugs the southern ridge, contouring along the 6400-foot level. A few wildflowers struggle for survival on this steep slope, but mostly the trail slides across scree slopes and pika-playgrounds on the curving ridge wall. At just over 6 miles from the trail, the PCT crosses a narrow shoulder of the mountain at 6600 feet. Pause here to soak up the incredible views before you-the horseshoe-shaped Shoe Lake lies 400 feet below, while far beyond the lake to the southeast is the cliff-lined Pinegrass Ridge. From the ridge top, it's another 0.5 mile down to the lakeshore, and then there's a 0.5-mile trail around the lake to explore. Wildflower meadows surround the lake, with a small grove of shade-providing evergreens on the peninsula in the center of the lake's horseshoe. Those who insist on camping nearby should return to the PCT and continue south about a mile to Hidden Spring Camp."

From the parking lot walk 0.2 miles across a grassy lawn to the TH sign. You will return on the Riverview Trail to the left. At 0.6 mile you reach a gauging station and a connecting trail to the Riverview Trail. From the Riverview Trail hike to the Rail Trail then go right until you see the sign for the South TH for Ferry Springs. In 0.8 miles arrive at the 750 ft high point where you climb over a barbed-wire fence via stairs and then begin your descent of 0.9 miles down to the  North TH of the Ferry Springs Trail. From here find the spur trail that takes you to the Riverview Trail and your return to your vehicle.

The main trail goes left and uphill to Alaska Lake. Take the other way. The Joe Lake trail starts here and goes straight ahead into the open meadows of slide alder and vine maple. This is where the work begins as the trail is no longer maintained past this point. Follow this rough trail around Alaska Mountain paying careful attention to where the main trail is (survey tape in trees marks the way). You will have to duck, crawl, and plow your way through this tangle of brush and the occasional downed log.  Watch your step as there are lots of rocks in the trail that will twist an ankle.  It's a pretty tedious trek through here so slow down and take your time.After about two miles, you will encounter a beautiful waterfall on your left.  Once you cross the water you'll be on the right side the waterfall and the trail is no nonsense at this point.  It goes straight up. You will not need hiking poles and coming back down almost guarantees removal of your pack and sliding it down in front of you with a rope.  Once you have made it to the top, a plethora of campsites await you and if you are there in midsummer, squadrons of mosquitoes. Aside from the lake and meadows surrounding the lake, there are also several small ponds surrounding the lake. -Side trip 1, at the Alaska Lake trail, there is an abandoned gold mine about 500' above the valley bottom. Look for it to the right of the Alaska Lake Trail. You can only see it from the bottom of the hill. Take a good look at where it is and then look for a faint trail that leads that direction off the Alaska Lake Trail. The mine has about 6"" of water in it during the summer and can be explored without flashlights. -Side trip 2, once at Joe Lake, the crest trail is a few hundred feet above the lake, the short route up is at the opposite end of the lake through the trees, but the no nonsense route up is right up the steep meadow or chute at the base of Huckleberry mountain.

Intrepid hikers can find a recently reconstructed trail over Skaar Pass to Circle Peak.The Meadow Mountain trail climbs 450 feet, offering views of Meadow and Mt. Pugh, and then abruptly loses 300 feet of elevation. At 1.3 miles is a junction with the Crystal Lake Trail. Find the old Crystal Creek Road at 1.3 miles and turn left.  The road continues climbing and passes a nice campsite. The trail enters an old clear cut at 3.5 miles from the trailhead and deteriorates further. At the east end of the clearcut, the trail ascends 500 feet along an old fireline. The trail levels off and enters the Glacier Peak Wilderness and ends at the untouched forest on the shore of Crystal Lake.   To find the currently unsigned trail from Crystal Lake to Circle Peak cross to the north side of the outlet stream at the lake, walk across the campsite on the lake shore, and follow the obvious trail leading away from the lake.  If you don't want to visit the lake, you can also bushwhack straight up-hill a few yards past the Glacier Peak Wilderness sign 0.25 mile west of Crystal Lake. You will come across the trail within 100 yards. You can follow the trail for approximately four miles to an old lookout site at the summit of Circle Peak. The trail contours for about one mile before dropping about 300 feet to Skaar Pass, crossing into the Circle Creek drainage and climbing for about 1.5 miles to reach the first of several meadows. Follow switchbacks up through forest and meadow another 1.75 miles to the summit ridge of Circle Peak. Don’t bother scrambling the final 200 yards, as the trail is sketchy and somewhat dangerous. Do linger below the lookout, soaking in views that include White Chuck, Glacier, Sloan and Pugh."

The spiny ridge is a true desert treasure--barren of trees and scoured endlessly by winds sweeping in from the Columbia River Basin, the Horse Heaven Hills are nonetheless well named.In years gone by, wild mustangs enjoyed the bounty of this rich desert ridgeline--the hills, lacking trees, shade, and water, sport a luxurious blanket of desert grasses and wildflowers on which horses love to graze. The wild horses are long gone, but the local population of mule deer still finds heaven in the rich hillside meadows, as do an assortment of birds and animals. How rich is the foliage? Our wild plant expert identified the following in one short visit: lupine, Hooker's balsamroot, Douglas's brodiaea, Cusick's sunflower, nine-leaf desert parsley, larkspur, Cusick's shooting star, yellow bells, and many species of milk vetch and locoweed.From the ridge-top parking area, begin a sweeping hike down the slopes of the flower-filled hills on the north side of the ridge crest. This north slope is all part of the BLM land and nice to hike when the wind is ripping in from the south. The bulk of the ridge provides some protection from the wind.After hiking down the slope and exploring a few of the many gullies that line the slope (check these out since many boast badger burrows), hike west on a traverse of the slope for a couple of miles. Go as far as you like. Eventually you'll want to angle back to the ridge top and then turn back to your start--a good turnaround point is 2046-foot-high Chandler Butte about 3 miles from the start of your journey. Follow the ridgeline back to your starting point. During the entire outing, you'll find fabulous views overlooking the Yakima Valley from Benton City back toward Prosser, below to the north, and out on farmland from the ridge southward."

Jackrabbits (both white-tailed and black-tailed) bound through the sagebrush, mule deer browse among the wildflower prairies, and coyotes prowl the coulees and canyons (seeking those bounding jacks, no doubt).The trailhead area offers reader-board kiosks with full information on the area, as well as maps of the ranch. There are many route options, including some scrambling possibilities. We offer a basic route here, but using the information available at the kiosks, you can modify and personalize your outing. Information on wildlife is also available, and occasional the BLM asks visitors to help biologists by keeping an eye out for specific species that biologists track to monitor the health of their populations.From behind the buildings, the old jeep track heads off into the open lands to the southwest. Angle down into the broad coulee full of sage and prairie grasses. As you roam (you actually are going flat here) into the coulee, the rugged basalt cliffs rise up on your right, providing opportunities for some great photography.About 1.2 miles into the hike you'll come to a scenic junction at the end of the road. To the north is a huge lake surrounded by coulee cliffs. Another lake sits 0.15 mile to the south. You have many options to choose from, but the best bet is to head west, following the trail sign. The rough path soon turns into a proper hiking trail that heads up onto a bench above the lake and continues another 1.5 miles past 2 more small lakes and eventually intersects with the Odessa--Lake Creek Trail (see Hike 80). Continue or turn back here, for a total 4- to 5-mile trek."

Walk out on a narrow spit. Explore a lagoon flourishing with birds. Watch playful seals ply harbor waters or comb the shoreline of this delightful maritime park. Jefferson County's South Indian Island Park is one of the best-kept secrets on the Olympic Peninsula.Once connected to the Quimper Peninsula by a low stretch of land, Indian Island was cut off in 1913 when Port Townsend merchants had a channel dredged. But it was the U.S. Navy that cut most of this landmass off from the public by establishing an ammunition storage depot here. Fortunately, a narrow strip along the south shore of the island has been established as parkland. And what a park!From the grassy bluff picnic area, find the trailhead at the edge of a thicket. Through a tunnel of vegetation the trail heads south, down along Portage Canal. In late spring enjoy the fragrance and blossoms of primrose and honeysuckle.  In late Summer there are copious blackberries.  The trail brushes up against some marshy openings, ideal for seeking out eagles and herons. It then climbs back up a bluff, ending at the park's east access road after 0.5 mile.Your hike, however, continues. Turn right, walking the road 0.25 mile and dropping off the bluff to reach an inviting beach. Over 1 mile of shoreline waits for your bootprints. You may have to do a little rock hopping or get your feet wet crossing the small creek draining a lagoon. Once across, continue east on a sandy spit complete with mini dunes and big views. Aside from Rainier grabbing most of your attention, watch for myriad species of birds flitting in the lagoon and bobbing in the bay.Walk to where a narrow strip of beach connects Indian to Marrowstone Island. Here the public beach ends. Turn around and enjoy your shoreline stroll all over again."

The last reliable late-season water is at 1.5 miles.  After the lakes trail junction the trail traverses meadows around the 'noses' of three ridges with great views all along including Rainier looming behind.  At a long 2 miles from the lakes trail junction, and just before a steep dropoff where the trail begins heading down, look for the (unmarked) trail to the lookout heading nearly straight back on your left.  The lookout trail switchbacks briefly and then gives up the pretense, shooting straight up the ridge over the top of one knoll and up to the lookout site (now just a USFS marker and four concrete corner blocks).  Rainier fills your field of view, close enough to touch, but don't forget to turn southeast for great views of the Goat Rocks crest, and south for a wonderful view of Mt Adams.  Sadly, the return requires the knee-pounding downhill but with your head full of views and your belly full of ripe huckleberries and blueberries (profuse throughout the meadows) you will find it easy to be distracted."

Amble through peaceful groves of fir and cedar. Savor the sweet smell of blossoming rhododendrons in the spring. Watch nervous ducks swim across placid waters while songbirds nesting in shoreline reeds hum sweet melodies. Gibbs Lake is a sanctuary for man and beast. But it almost didn't turn out this way. Thanks to negotiations by the Jefferson Land Trust, the Washington State Department of Natural Resources ceased logging here and converted the 669-acre haven into a county park.Over nine trails crisscross the forested hills surrounding Gibbs Lake. Most appeal more to mountain bikers and equestrians than to hikers, but the 1.75-mile Lakeside Trail combined with Jack's Track makes for a delightful hike. The trailhead kiosk marks the point where you'll be returning on this loop. Start your hike on the well-defined trail leaving from the southwest corner of the parking lot.Cross the access road after 500 feet. Now in damp forest logged during the Depression years, slowly drop to an alder and big fir flat. At 0.5 mile Gibbs Lake can be made out through the trees, but the trail courses away from it, crossing several creeks to ascend drier ground. After 1 mile the lake comes in view once more. Soon afterward, pass two massive Doug-firs, mysteriously granted a stay of execution while their neighbors ended up planked and boarded.More big trees, including a grove of mature cedars, are soon encountered. At 1.5 miles work your way through a small wetland. Notice the Sitka spruce, common along the coastal strip but an anomaly in the dry forests of the Olympic rain shadow. At 1.75 miles the Lakeside Trail crosses Gibbs's outlet creek, ending at a dirt road. Pick up Jack's Track across the roadway to the right.The trail makes a steep little climb onto a bluff above the lake. Stay left at a trail fork. At the next junction keep right. Soon afterward approach a five-way signed trail intersection. Head right on the trail (not on the old woods road), emerging in a parking lot after 0.1 mile. Your vehicle is in the next lot. Pick up the trail again to close the loop after a few more minutes of hiking.For more information about Gibbs Lake County Park, see their website at www.countyrec.com or call 360-385-9129."

The waters here are flat and slow moving, creating great habitat for a number of birds and animals, both in and out of the water.However, beyond the rich riparian world at the rivers' edges, the desert rolls on. So fish and frogs, waterfowl and beavers live as neighbors with desert-dwelling rattlesnakes, horned lizards, scorpions, and kangaroo rats. All in all, this is a novel world to explore.Find the trail leading east and set off to explore. Within 0.5 mile you'll find a viewpoint overlooking Smiths Harbor--a body of water that looks like a lovely lake but is actually just part of the slow-moving Walla Walla River Delta. Here birdlife is buzzing! Birds range from raptors to game birds to songbirds--kingfishers, herons, geese, flickers, sage sparrows, quails, and more.From here the trail rolls along the area between the gravel road and the harbor for another mile before reaching the eastern end of the water and meeting another road that comes down from the main access road (this road is closed until March 15 each year). Hike down the road about 0.5 mile to reach the Walla Walla River and more rich riparian habitat surrounding it.Hike back up the road or angle northeast and hike cross-country another 1.5 miles just off the main access road to find a faint game trail to follow. You'll reach another road heading toward the river about 3 miles from your starting point. The way passes the winding Walla Walla River, and if you reach  a railroad grade turning south to cross the river, you are about at the eastern end of the public lands of the National Wildlife Refuge site."

Several dirt roads mix and merge throughout the area, so you have plenty of opportunity to explore--and the area is well worth exploring. You'll find outstanding wildflowers throughout the Badger Mountain area. In late spring, the flowers carpet the prairie with varied colors and textures. The nature of the flowers changes with the topography: On the rocky barren slopes buckwheat is dominant. In the lush open sagelands, you'll find desert lupine, balsamroot, white lupine, and brodiaea.Along the first 2 miles of the jeep track, you'll find a series of bluebird houses posted along the fence line.

Watch the entire deep emerald Dosewallips Valley unravel before you. And mountains! Towering crags of snow and ice: The Brothers, Anderson, Elk Lick, Diamond, and LaCrosse pack the southern horizon. At your feet, daz-zling displays of wildflowers grace sun-kissed slopes. It's a stiff climb to Sunnybrook Meadows, but the expansive views and sprawling meadows are sure to brighten your day.Consider the first 2.5 miles of this hike a warm-up. Starting on the well-groomed Dosewallips Trail, enjoy easy walking through cool forest. At 1.4 miles bear right at a junction (signed ""Hayden Pass""). Pass Soda Springs and, if lucky, observe salt-craving deer relishing the seeps. Soon afterward, Sunny Brook is crossed in a deep dark glen, a far cry from its solar-enriched upper reaches.At 2.5 miles leave behind this gentle hiking and the Dosewallips River Trail for the Constance Pass Trail (elev. 2200 ft). This lightly used but well-defined trail takes off through salal-choked forest up a steep rib via a series of short switchbacks. The forest is dry, with many openings in the canopy providing impressive window views stoking you for the grand payoff.Pass through a rhody jungle where, at about 3600 feet, a reliable spring bubbles from the ground (the only water until the meadows). The climb now stiffens through a hot rocky corridor. But stands of mature mountain hemlock soon bring shaded relief. After 2.5 miles of relentless climbing the trail breaks out into a wet meadow (elev. 4900 ft). In another 0.1 mile a tumbling brook lined with yellow monkey flowers invites sipping and face-splashing.The trail rounds a high basin cut by a myriad of tributaries that collectively become Sunny Brook. As the trail darts between subalpine forest and expanding meadows, the views grow. To the south over the verdant Dosewallips Valley, snowfields clinging to The Brothers and Elk Lick Mountain shimmer in the afternoon sun. Keep climbing-it gets better. Through thick greenery splattered with a mosaic of colors, work your way up to a tiny little tarn (elev. 5500 ft). Watering hole for resident marmots, breeding ground for resident mosquitoes, and feeding ground for resident frogs, it's a beautiful oasis tucked beneath a barren ridge.Just to the south find a small rise offering sweeping views to the south. Look straight across to Anderson Pass flanked by glacier-harboring Mounts Anderson and LaCrosse. Look west toward Hayden Pass. Look all around and savor the solitude."

The refuge encompasses many flooded fields, sloughs, and inlets along the Columbia River. It also sprawls across farmlands that provide winter forage for migratory birds.This area draws thousands of ducks, geese, and swans each year, usually beginning in November. Look for tundra swans, redheads, cinnamon teal, green-winged teals, mergansers of all kinds, buffleheads, Canada geese, mallards, pintails, and the ever-present coots.Even when the migratory waterfowl are gone, the area is worth a visit. With desert on one side and the rich riparian area of the Columbia River on the other, an odd mix of birds and animals congregates at the refuge. Meadowlarks, red-winged blackbirds, and an array of swallows flit around the reeds near the water. Quails, pheasants, and mourning doves duck under the sagebrush and desert plants. Mule deer wander throughout the area, but you'll also find hares, badgers, beavers, muskrats, and more.The route you'll follow is a self-guided nature trail that begins at the refuge's environmental education center and winds around part of the Burbank Slough. Interpretive signs and a photo/bird watching blind are located along the trail. The blind, found less than 0.25 mile out, and the trail to it are paved and accessible to wheelchairs. Beyond that, the trail narrows and turns to dirt. The path wanders out to impressive viewpoints and many sheltered locations that allow you to photograph birds more easily.The loop is closed by hiking South Lake Road from the north side of the slough back to the education center. Off-trail rambles can be enjoyed by walking across the road to the east side into rolling refuge lands, but be aware that this part of the refuge is open to hunting, so it should be visited by casual walkers from mid-October through January.Spend some time visiting the refuge's education center, which alone is well worth the visit."

The Corps of Engineers has hosted revegetation plantings to restore the native steppe plants to improve the wildlife habitat (and therefore wildlife populations). The route through the area takes advantage of the restoration efforts, exploring the rich foliage and wildlife habitat of the area along the pretty stretch of the Snake River--a section of Lake Sacajawea, the impoundment behind the Ice Harbor Dam. The first 2 miles of hiking along the road (closed to vehicles) lead directly to the top of the bluff overlooking the area. Wonderful views!Dalton Lake at the trailhead is a popular fishing spot, often crowded with families. Once away from the trailhead, you'll find solitary hiking. At about 0.5 mile from the trailhead, a side road leads to the left. Pass by it for now, but keep it in mind for later exploration.Continue along the road as it follows the river. At about 2 miles, you'll reach the end of the road at a point overlooking a small cove along the riverbank. Great views abound--waterfowl often seek refuge in this sheltered spot, and deer frequently water along the shoreline here, too.Backtrack along the road to that sidetrack. If you prefer to keep your outing to 4 miles, head back to your vehicle, but to stretch your trek another 2 or 3 miles, head up that side track to access the heart of this wild area. The road/path winds around small rocky bluffs above the river. When you reach a junction in a mile or so, keep right to find a viewpoint looking back down on the river."

In 0.6 mi, a short side trail descends to the right to Backbone Lake, a less attractive, tree-choked hole filled with water. The shoreline is all brushy, no camps. There used to be a trail sign at the junction, but only the 4x4 post remains. Someone carved the letters LAKE-> into a tree. Continue up and at ~1 mi. enjoy a short view of the Coal Creek woods on the south side of Hwy. 12. At ~ 2 mi. cross an open area on a rock slab with a nice view of Tatoosh Pk. In early summer, a few orchids bloom here. The trail drops a bit and then continues to ascend to the N. P. boundary at Stevens Canyon Hwy. Proceed only if you have paid the entry fee or have an annual pass. The trail emerges east of the cut opposite a large parking area. A picnic on one of the tables west of the cut will be a reward for this hike, with a nice view of the mountain.

This BLM land is one of the areas described within that agency's ""Watchable Wildflower"" booklet.By hiking just below the bluff cliffs, hikers can explore for some time. There are no definitive trails to follow, but the open slope offers unobstructed routes of exploration. Work your way northeast from the parking area and hug the slope. Watch for mule deer under the bluff as they frequently browse among the buckwheat that thrives here.This is also prime habitat of chukar--a beautiful upland game bird that prefers steep slopes and arid landscapes. However, chukar is just one of the upland bird species that call this rich, sloped prairie home.
