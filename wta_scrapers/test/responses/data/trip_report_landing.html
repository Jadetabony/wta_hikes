                    <div class="show-with-full"><p>Decided to do a morning walk through the woods. Living in the Seattle area, it's too far to drive to the mountains before work. </p>
<p>This is a nice short little urban hike that is perfect for an early morning walk. Past three other people and their dogs.</p>
<p>Started off of Barton Street and headed west on the main loop. Part of the trail goes down an alley, just be respectful of the houses you walk past. Walked through the church parking lot a little bit to get to the rest of the trails.</p>
<p>It is overgrown in places, or branches that are low hanging. At 5'7" I had to duck around a lot of branches. The nice part about this trail is that even when it's misty Seattle Weather you don't get very wet, the trees protect you. And while you can hear the cars in the distance it's a great way to feel miles away from it all.</p>
<p>the trails themselves are in great condition. I will forewarn you that some of the boardwalk sections on the lower loop on the south side do not currently have the grate stuff across most of it. It was a little slick walking across.</p></div>

                    <div class="show-with-full"><p>The first day we picked up our permit, hiked to Dege Peak in the late afternoon, and camped at the Whiteriver Campground.  While driving from Sunrise to Whiteriver, we saw some elk in the woods.</p>
<p>The second day we hiked the Emmons Moraine trail on our way to Glacier Basin.  The weather was perfect all three days we were on the mountain.  It was 70 degrees F. during the day with a nice breeze.  The bugs did not bother us even though we did not use any repellent.  The entire trip was thrilling and comfortable.  We camped at Glacier Basin that night.</p>
<p>In the afternoon of our second day we hiked the climber's trail up to the foot of the glacier.  The mountain had a stunning cloud display all afternoon with wind gusts blowing snow into the air at the summit.  It was a spectacular display.</p>
<p>A ground squirrel got into my buddy's gear and damaged his headlamp and pack during the afternoon.  We hung our packs at night even though there were bear-proof barrels where we stored our food.</p>
<p>The third day we hiked the switchback trail from the Glacier Basin trail and saw the Winthrop Glacier up close and personal from Third Burroughs.  There were mountain goats in the meadows.  We hiked back down the switchback trail and back to the Whiteriver parking lot.</p>
<p>Our original plan was to the do a loop hike from Glacier Basin up to Burroughs Mountains, to Sunrise, and back to Whiteriver.  After studying the topo maps, we opted to do Third Burroughs as a side trip.  When we could see the entire area from Third Burroughs it was obvious that our decision was a good one.</p>
<p>It isn't often that a trip exceeds your greatest expectations, but this certainly how my two friends and I feel about this wonderful experience.</p></div>

                    <div class="show-with-full"><p>Walked the Pass Lake loop early Thursday afternoon.  Nobody else parked at the boatramp/trail head parking lot right off hwy 20 and had the trail to myself.  No trail issues other than it's fairly easy to end up going too far on the one "stub" bit along the lake and end up in a private homeowners back yard.  There is plenty of parking and an outhouse at the trailhead.  The lot is now a Discover Pass required spot.  The trail is not super exciting and doesn't offer many very good views of the lake, but is a nice leg stretcher.  When every other trail in the area is mobbed with Deception Pass campers this one seems to provide some solace. </p></div>

                    <div class="show-with-full"><p>I know already that you are shaking your head incredulously, "what does he mean, there are no bugs"? I kid you not, on our trip, to the summit of Crystal and then to upper Crystal Lake, we encountered no bugs of significance!</p>
<p>Really the whole trip was great. Combining both hikes made for 12.3 miles and 4200' in gain. The tread is excellent and the grade never steep. It is very doable. Starting early we were in shade for the first half of the day.</p>
<p>Wildflowers were out in mass today. Endemics like Magenta Paintbrush and Rainiera, as well as dozens of old stand-bys. Flowers are peaking there now. Berries are just starting to get their ripe on. We ate a few blue berries but not many. The super small, Squaw berries however, were really good. We ate many of those.</p>
<p>Crystal Peak was once a fire lookout. Nothing remains now other than some very small cement footings. The views from Rainier to the Goat Rocks are great. To the north we looked into the Crystal Lakes basin. It was too tempting to pass up. Both lakes are swimable although the upper is much larger. Campsites at both lakes are 5 star.</p>
<p>I will be back to spend a night or two here soon!</p></div>

Our plan for a leisurely, 6 mile hike with 1,000 ft elevation turned into this shorter but much steeper hike with about the same elevation gain! I was happy to get on any trail, and so were the dogs. Not much view from the top, no real overlook, plus the cloudy skies obscured it all anyway. I’m glad we found this trail, though I don’t really see a reason to do it again! A great short workout and a chance to get outside!</p></div>

Trail is "difficult" because it's 4 miles uphill, 2200 ft elevation, with the last two uphills steep and with loose rocks.  Trail was dusty in sections, both in forested areas and exposed in some.  Views from the top offered St. Maries, Idaho to the south; and the "chain" lakes to the north.  The chain lakes are on both sides of the Coeur d'Alene River and include Killarny Lake, Black Lake, Swan Lake, etc.  </p>

                    <div class="show-with-full"><p>I decided to take a impromptu vacation day today from work and headed out to Sunrise for a little me time in the outdoors. When I arrived at the parking lot at Sunrise (8:45am) I was pleasantly surprised to find just a handful of cars here.</p>
<p>After putting my boots on and gathering my things, I was working my way up the Sourdough Ridge trail towards Frozen Lake by 9:00am and encountered a few packs of people as I my way west. As I neared Frozen lake, I noticed a number of hikers making their way up towards Bouroughs, so I changed my plan and headed towards Skyscraper Mountain instead.</p>
<p>As I started working my way down the Wonderland Trail, a bit of a breeze picked up, which not only felt great, but helped keep the bugs away. This made for perfect conditions to be outside and the trail itself was also in very good shape. The best part is that all the snow fields have melted away, which makes life a lot easier as well.</p>
<p>I made my way along the Wonderland, past Berkley Park and up the ridge to Skyscraper Pass. Veer right as you work your way down to the path that leads up Skyscraper to the summit and call it good.  </p>
<p>Note: The WTA hiking info calls the last climb to the top a scramble. While I wouldn't exactly call it a scramble because I never once had to use my hands to obtain the summit, there are several large steps needed to reach the top. Other than that, it's a series of short switchbacks on a loose gravel and soft dirt path up the spine, so here's where I'll give a recommendation. If you're going to the top to enjoy the breathtaking 360 view, wear proper footwear for the outdoors (something with good support and grip) and trekking poles. Since you'll not be scrambling with your hands, these two items will assist you with your balance as you not only make your way up, but down. Remember, you'll be going downhill on loose gravel at points.</p>
<p>I encountered two other hikers on my way out, and as expected, several more on the return trip back to Sunrise (but nothing like you'll see when you come out on a weekend day.)<br /><br />As far as wildlife goes, I encountered marmont, pika and chipmunk's, but no goat or bear, so you can't win them all. :)<br /><br />When I arrived back to the parking lot, I found it to be full and noticed cars circling, looking for spots, so it took 4 hours on the weekday to fill up.<br /><br />Overall, I hiked 9 miles roundtrip and had a wonderful day enjoying the views along the way. The next time you're out at Sunrise and are looking for something to do that takes you away from the more popular Burroughs or Fremont hikes, consider a trek along the Wonderland trail out to Skyscraper instead.</p></div>

<p>We, and several other hiking groups, struggle finding the Wild Goose trail at Artist Point parking lot. The snow was covering it. We walked down the road a bit and saw the trail and followed it back to completed the loop!</p>

<p>A few mosquitos and big suckers! Wish I had worn bug spray. Got a few bites. Tons of blackberries along the start of the trail. Mostly still green but a few almost ripe ones here and there. </p>
<p>Trail itself is in excellent condition. Lots of rocks and tree roots, but that's just the nature of this trail. Only went to the middle falls, but it was gorgeous. Legs were getting tired and didn't feel like tromping up what I've heard is the hardest part of the trail to see the upper falls. Maybe next time. </p></div>

We used the Commonwealth trail to skip the first big switchback on the PCT and gain The opportunity to walk along the creek. On the PCT itself there’s water in a couple of places, but the only significant source is the waterfall below the avalanche chute. The PCT is in great shape; the summit trail is not. Lots of loose rocks and dust. Stay close to your partners. The summit was completely clouded over with only a few peeks along the ridge. Heard lots of pika and marmots, but saw none.</p></div>

                    <div class="show-with-full"><p>Naches Peak Loop is my absolute favorite hike to date. The weather was great, the flowers were blooming, and it was a pretty easy hike. I had read several trip reports prior to hiking the trail, so I brought plenty of bug spray. To my surprise, we didn’t encounter any pesky bugs the entire time we were out so I didn’t end up using the bug spray. We got to the trail at about 11:30 and there was plenty of parking, and the trail wasn’t too crowded. There was one log across the trail that you have to climb over twice (it’s in a switchback) but it wasn’t too bad. I would recommend bringing a map, or reading the trail description for directions as the trail isn’t well marked. We ended up looping around tipsoo lake, across the highway on a bridge, and out on the pacific crest trail for a ways before we turned back. </p></div>

There’s no elevation gain but if you add Spencer Island to your walk you can put in some good mileage. <br />Many birds live out here. You sure to see Bald Eagles, Blue Herons, Red Tail Hawks and so many others that I don’t know their names. <br />Today’s stroll I had my brother with me. He really liked the area. Flowers out and fresh blackberries to munch on <br />I’ve also brought my elderly mom out here. There’s a few benches for rest stops. She only made it from under the I5 bridge to Spencer Island Bridge. All paved pathway. I ended up going and getting the truck and drive back to get her. This road along the treatment plant was gravel but is now paved.</p></div>

<p><strong>Caution: Blind corners and drivers disregarding traffic directionality create Sky Country parking lot hazards.</strong>  Every stretch of the figure-8-shaped lot is a one-way (see the attached picture).  Directionality is indicated with traffic signs and pavement arrows.  However, people frequently drive against the one-ways.  We’ve all disregarded parking lot traffic signs, but the lot has blind corners that are only safe when directionality is followed.  I have seen people charging excitedly into the parking lot and around blind corners with the confidence they have the right-of-way to the whole lane.  I have also seen people in a hurry to get home drive furiously around the same blind corners the wrong way.  At some point, people will collide.  So, do not be one of those people; recognize that, once you are in the parking lot, Mad Max rules apply and drive cautiously around every corner assuming someone could be hurtling against the one-way toward you.</p></div>

                    <div class="show-with-full"><p>The rain helped us change our plans from a hike with spectacular views to a lake that we knew would be pretty with fog :). Road is still in decent condition but every year the potholes get worse! Quite a few sections where there are no ways to avoid hitting some. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Trail is in good condition, lots of big steps as the ground gets worn around roots and rocks from all the traffic. Some of the amazing bridge work around the lake is broken, probably could be repaired rather than replaced, but nothing to hard to navigate around. Flowers are blooming but probably near the end. Salmon, huckle, and blueberries were all ripe. Great shorter hike to enjoy a gloomy pnw day!</p></div>

                    <div class="show-with-full"><p>We took a rainy day walk out on the boardwalks at Juanita Bay Park today. It was our first time to the park and we were surprised how nice it was. Even though it is wedged between a main road and the lake, you cannot hear the cars from the two boardwalk trails (you can hear them on the causeway as you are right next to the road there). We saw multiple great blue herons, lots of baby mallards, some coots, flickers, towhees, osprey, and some interesting ducks we haven't identified yet. We were told lots of turtles can usually be seen but none of them were out in the rain today. The lily pads are blooming along with fireweed and the blackberries are starting to ripen. </p>
<p>A good size parking lot and bathrooms are provided and there are lots of benches along the trails.</p>
<p>This summer, my four-year-old son and I are hiking to raise money for Washington Trails Association. Please consider donating to one of our Hike-A-Thons at the below links. Thank you and Happy Hiking!</p></div>

                    <div class="show-with-full"><p>We hiked the Eastern Section of the Burnt Bridge Creek Trail from NE 90th Avenue to Devine Road and back as the kick-off for our Hike-a-Thon. It was a comfortable day on the trail today with marine air cloud cover and 70 degrees. Most native plants along the trail had gone to seed (or berries) but the Nootka roses still were blooming and scented the air as we walked by. Despite the pleasant conditions, I was surprised how few people were out on the trail walking or bicycling.</p></div>

Made good time: 1 hr 52 min. for ascent.  Huckleberries ripe and delicious, also salmonberry, thimbleberry and even twisted stalk!  Azaleas starting to bloom at 5,000' level.  Trail is in good shape with a few easy(and fun) log crossings.  No views to the west, but easterly views were beautiful, as always!</p></div>

                    <div class="show-with-full"><p>This hike was the Grace Lakes, top of Stevens Pass behind the top of Brooks Chair Lift. There’re 3 beautiful lakes here. Just follow cat track to top of Brooks Chairlift. The cat track is very steep and you get a nice workout. At top of Brooks head directly behind the chairlift disembark area and you’ll see the 1<sup>st</sup> lake. Follow the well beaten trails to the other lakes.  The lakes are beautiful and solitude. No one there. I hiked all 3 and ate lunch at Summit Lake, then returned. Took about 3 hours total. Great day trip hike.</p></div>

                    <div class="show-with-full"><p>Did a loop from Tulacua Meadows to Squaw Lake, Cathedral Rock, Deception Pass and back down along Hiyas Lake. The first two miles are up and up but the trail is well graded and in very good condition. Squaw Lake is smallish, shallow and warm so bring a swimsuit. I highly recommend a detour to the trail to Peggy’ Pond but the trail itself is rough and exposed: I turned back half way. Cathedral Rock is monumental and the views are worth the trip. The walk to Deception Pass and back along Hiyas lake quite pleasant. <br />Correction to directions: take exit 80 (not 84) to Roslyn. The last 12 miles to the TH are on a dirt road that is washboard most of the way. I made it in my sedan but it probably shortened its life by a year. Very few bugs up by Cathedral Rock but got a bit nasty at Deception Pass and along the lake.</p></div>

Got an early start from Seattle (around 7) and only encountered a few other people on the way up.  On the way down, we saw people every 15 minutes or so.  Go early or get ready to share the trail.   All in good condition though we were surprised by how rocky the trail was, keep it in mind if you are planning on bringing your dog.  I'll leave her home next time.  </p></div>

On a Thursday at 11 there were only a half dozen other cars and half of those people were leaving as we got started. We ran into 3 groups of PCT hikers at the lake. There was a very large tent that had collapsed at the far end of the lake. I don’t know if it’s been abandoned or how long it’s been there.</p></div>

So we took Wilderness Pk Loop, which has no views anyway. The temps were perfect for hiking, about 60 degrees. What a relief, after the 90 degree hikes of late. This hike is a wonderful short hike with great trails, cool bridges, well maintained trails and interesting very green forests.  It’s another good hike close to the megopolis. I like the 2 mile climb on the loop and then the relaxing descent back to the car. The parking lot was full when we finished, so it must be tough to find parking on weekends. We did the loop at a moderate pace in just under 2 hours. We say about 20 other hikers today. </p></div>

                    <div class="show-with-full"><p>Decided to try out a new hike today. This one was definitely different. I should call it the trail of distraction...for multiple reasons. From the trailhead on, you can see signs of the forest fire from last year. It was interesting to see the devastation yet new growth too. The trail quickly comes to a newly built bridge which you cross. On both sides of the creek there looks like trails going up stream but don’t take those, continue across the bridge and up the bank. Shortly you come to a side trail on the left then soon after a second trail. I would say taking the two side trails to the falls is a must. Both trails are eroding in spots and pretty steep but we managed fine plus they’re short. The view of the falls is great. There must have been a flash flood recently because the bank was covered in dried mud, which was another interesting thing to see. After the detours the trails continued for steeply for a bit then levels out for the rest of the hike. There is a gully you have to cross where the trail was washed out but it was easy to navigate if you go up stream a bit. Several trees over the trail past this point but most could be stepped over. We eventually got to the location where there was suppose to be a bridge but that is no longer there. It’s actually completely gone now...the previous post mentioned seeing the burned bridge but whatever flood came through here must have taken it out. It was easy to cross the stream though. Once on the other side just head right upstream and you’ll see the other falls. It’s smaller but you’re able to walk right up to it, you do have to cross the stream a second time though. All in all it was a successful hike. Signs of the fire and flood made it different.<br />Last pic is of the gully to cross over.</p></div>

                    <div class="show-with-full"><p>Two short trails to start off Hikeathon! We went up to Windy Ridge for a little sightseeing. Since the eruption was such a part of our lives,  we like to go every few years and watch the changes taking place in the blast zone. We walked to Meta lake, a short little walk that hardly seems the half mile listed in the guidebook, it's a beautiful little lake with an interesting natural history. The only thing to report is the path out to the viewing platform is underwater about 6 inches. </p>
<p>The next little hike was the Windy Ridge trail. We both hiked up the steep stairs to a better viewpoint of Spirit Lake. My hubby can't hike much, so he volunteered to pick me up at the end of the Windy Ridge trail. This might be an option when traveling with non hikers. The trail continues past the viewpoint and heads gradually down on the opposite side of the ridge as the road. There are some great views of Spirit Lake with Mt Rainier in the background. As the trail goes down, beware of the slippery pumice under the cliffs, I had tennis shoes and wish I would have worn something with a bit more traction. I would be hesitant to take small children on this trail just because of that small section. Compared to Windy Ridge, it is surprisingly green here, lots of shrubs and perennial plants. It then swings back around the ridge and meets the road.  The trail must not be hiked much, even tho it is so short, it's pretty overgrown. </p></div>

                    <div class="show-with-full"><p>Went to White River to camp with the kids.  On the 1st, we headed up the Glacier Basin trail at the far end of Loop D.  We had 8 kids (ages 2-10) and 3 adults.  It was slow going (because toddlers), and we only went 1.5 miles in so this trip report will be written with that in mind.<br /><br />The first mile (to the Emmons Moiraine branch off) is shaded most of the time.  After an initial short walk from the campground, it is a mild, but steady incline.  There are a number of spots where the dropoff towards the river is steep, and if you have a little kiddo that likes to play the "run near the edge" game, you may want to be prepared with your containment of choice, as the trail can be dusty and prone to slipping, and the slide down is steep and long. The trail is wide enough that the busy traffic can pass you (or you can pass the slow traffic) despite the drop off.  And there are a few "waterfalls" down the side of the mountain towards the river with bridges over them that offer a cool breeze on a hot day.<br /><br />Around the one mile mark, there's a branch to your left at nearly a 90 degree angle straight into some trees (and a small bridge) to cross the White River and switchback up a sandy embankment to the Emmons Moiraine.  Just going across the river - which requires navigating a short section of large rocks and then crossing a bridge made from one large log and one handrail - and then up the embankment will take you to views a few hundred feet up the trail.  (At the top, you'll see the trail split into three paths, two of which are blocked by rocks - follow the one not blocked by rocks.)<br /><br />We peaked over at the Emmons Moiraine (so cool to see the start of a fork of the White River, so sad to see how it is receeding over the years due to climate change), but we also went another half mile up the Glacier Basin Trail.<br /><br />This section of Glacier Basin Trail has much less shade, though there still is some.  The path also narrows such that you'll want to pause to let people pass, and there are not so many steep dropoffs.  There is, however, water across the trail in many spots, so plan children's footwear accordingly.  None of it was too difficult for even the youngest members to get across with help.  In warm weather, it can absolutely feel quite hot at times, and dusty, so please bring plenty of water!</p>

                    <div class="show-with-full"><p>The forest road has been regraded and is in good shape. It is a single lane road that is not exceptionally narrow, however there are a few rough sections where a high clearance vehicle would do best and the road is quite steep, gaining elevation quickly. We had an all-wheel drive SUV, and I think my lower clearance rear wheel drive city car would have struggled. We arrived on a Wednesday at 8:20 am to the small trailhead lot, being the third car after another SUV and a small bus with trail workers from Northwest Youth Corps. They were pretty quiet and then I noted that they were all signing to each other. They stayed all day and did some good work building steps on the lower trail.</p>
<p>We started up the trail at 8:35 am. The trail is in good shape and very little elevation is gained in the first mile. The trail does get progressively steeper. There is good tree and shade cover in the morning until you reach the trail marker that points you to either the lake or Trappers Peak, at about 4 miles. We reached that point at roughly two and a half hours. After taking the turn to Trappers Peak we were much more exposed and it began to get hot. The trail steepens significantly and we encountered some third-class scrambling where we needed to use our hands and arms. This area was not too far from the trail junction. There is a crux move where a good sized boulder in the middle of the more vertical trail needs to be surmounted and fortunately a small tree can be used to muscle your way up and over. It’s actually easier on the way down.</p>
<p>We continued up the ridge towards Trappers Peak and stopped at a shoulder about 300 feet shy of the summit. I was carrying a 25-pound pack with photo gear and it was getting pretty hot so we decided that this was good enough. We wanted to have enough gas in the tank for the descent. The sky was lightly hazy with sparse clouds and the views were spectacular. I will definitely come again, and pack lighter.</p>
<p>We took hiking poles but they never left our packs. They would be more of a hinderance in the steep sections than an asset. Hydration: I took just over 3 liters of water and tea and ran out 3 miles from the trailhead on the way down. Hot day. There are some streams on the way up and some snow patches up top so those provide another source. Bugs: The bugs were benign in the cool shade on the way up but as the day heated up they came out in force. The bug brigade featured black flies and mosquitos. I wore an Ex Officio BugsAway shirt and doused myself with Sawyers bug spray with Picaridan, and they still persisted. Very annoying. The best course of action was to just keep moving.</p>
<p>The WTA description on elevation gain must be to the lake. Even though we were a bit shy of the summit our gain was 3,180 feet over 10.44 miles round trip. It might sound easy but we thought it was tougher than the old trail on Mailbox Peak as the steep scrambling on a hot day can be exhausting. Even though it was a good workout for us, a couple of old guys, 69 and 70, we loved the hike and highly recommend it. Surprisingly, as we descended, we encountered more hikers going up than we expected, most packing for an overnight at the lake. The small trailhead parking area was overflowing when we came out. Go early and go mid-week.</p>
<p>I took one virtual reality spherical panoramic photo. It provides an immersive experience of the views from the shoulder, so check it out. Here is the link to view it in a pano viewer at 360cities.net. Be sure to click the full screen icon as you roll over the upper right of the photo for best viewing. <span><em><a href="https://www.360cities.net/image/trappers-peak-south-shoulder-north-cascades-national-park-wa-state">https://www.360cities.net/image/trappers-peak-south-shoulder-north-cascades-national-park-wa-state</a></em></span></p>

<p>SNOW - A few snow patches prior to the Gap, but all with a good foot trail and comfortable to pass.  Definitely want to have poles though. </p>
<p>WILD FLOWERS - Lots of wildflowers, mostly monkey flower at the in the meadows just past the Summerland camp.  Also bistort, valerian, white, yellow and purple louse wort, purple and yellow Astors, some paintbrush, partridge foot, alpine penmen and alpine lupine.</p>
<p>ANIMAL LIFE - Two BABY Marmots, one adult Marmot, 4 Mountain Goats near the gap and 14 right by the alpine lake . . . mostly moms and babies.</p>
<p>STATS - It was about 13 miles round trip and just under 3,000 feet gain per my Gaia GPS unit.</p>

                    <div class="show-with-full"><p>Great hike!  Fairly steep, but we just took it slow and steady.  Bugs were pretty bad periodically, especially in areas where there was a lot of brush/flowers like in the meadow, but in other areas were not bad at all.  They weren't bad at the top where we had our lunch, which was lovely.  Nice breeze up there too, which helped.  There were a few little patches of snow (not on the trail) that were good for the dogs to roll around in, and also for rubbing on our skin.  :)  There is one area where the road has washed out, but even my stupidly-low-clearance Honda Fit made it just fine.  </p></div>

                    <div class="show-with-full"><p>I parked at the sportsmen's club and hiked 1) high school trail 2) section line to WT3 3)along the trail to WT2 4) TMT to tradition plateau 5) bus trail to the powerline trail 6) back to the car via Park Pointe trails.</p>
<p>Of note:</p>
<p>When you reach the clearing at WT2 you might wonder where the summit is. It's inside the fence with the communication towers, but the sign is right next to the fence. Follow along the fence to the right and you'll find a view eastwards towards Mt Si and the connector trail that leads to the TMT in about 1/4 mile downhill. There's a new switchback or two on the TMT here, very smooth and nice compared to the old rooty section. </p>
<p>the TMT has been REROUTED from Fred's Corner. It follows what used to be the WT3 Railroad Grade for a bit (east), then downhill (north) on a new section of trail to meet the old TMT. There are new signs at the junction with the new trail... and I think one of the signs is wrong :( It points the TMT as going towards the WT1 trail (east-ish) rather than west-ish towards the WT3/WT2 saddle. So unless they are re-routing the whole trail, the sign is WRONG, don't follow it! The new trail segment is the standard DNR Fred Flintstone Trail Machine business, a little rough still but it'll smooth out nicely. It's runnable now, unlike the replaced segment that was very rocky and slippery. </p>
<p>Park Pointe has new signs at the trail junctions, this is great because the area was confusing  the first few times I hiked it. Much simpler now with the signs, thanks!</p>
<p>This route is about 11 miles/3500 gain/loss </p>

                    <div class="show-with-full"><p>Last week (July 24th 2018) the flowers were coming out on the North east part of the loop as we headed out CLOCKWISE ( the recommended direction) but yesterday they were out, colors fading and some drying up. If you want to see flowers on this loop go within the next week! Wear bug spray, although not as many bugs yesterday as the week before, and not bad enough to put anyone off going on this restorative hike. Avalance Lilies mostly gone. It gets hot and dry on this loop so we try to be on the trail before 8 am. on a hot day. After 10 am it gets busy and the parking lot fills up. One of our favorite hikes.</p>

                    <div class="show-with-full"><p>First time doing this hike, it was grueling and rewarding. The trail was challenging - steep and rocky in sections, with many stretches overgrown with salmonberries (it is a rainforest, after all). This is a really special place, a peak in the southwest Olympics with not only incredible views, but also lush vegetation and a trail that passes through ancient forests, rockslide and subalpine meadows. I enjoyed not only the final destination, but the hike in its' entirety.</p>
<p>Note: the actual trail starts about 20 ft in front of (for those coming from the south) the Pete's Creek Trailhead sign. The trail that leaves from the parking lot descends to the West fork Humptulips river, which is a nice hike too.</p>
<p>I hiked this trail with my dog, we spent the night at the wonderful Campbell Tree Grove Campground, which is a few minutes up the road. We arrived at the trailhead and began the hike in the mists. The vegetation overgrowing the trail (mostly salmonberry) was dewy, but I didn't mind. The trail starts out less steep, then quickly goes up and up, past a campsite with running water, into a rockslide meadow, then up to Moonshine flat, which also has water and more campsites.  We took many breaks to rest and enjoy the scenery.</p>
<p>The final stretch up to the peak is especially grueling and challenging, but by then the views become spectacular and there were meadows full of wildflowers plus delicious blueberries (there were blueberries lower down but they weren't as sweet). The bugs were slightly annoying but not so bad to really get in the way of enjoying this hike. </p>
<p>The views from the summit are superlative, but the sky was a bit hazy today. Marine layer clouds covered the Quinault Valley, Greys Harbor and the Pacific Ocean, giving the sense that Colonel Bob Peak was floating above the fog.</p>
<p>The hike down is no joke either. After many breaks, we arrived at the trailhead at 3 pm. Definitely very glad I did this hike. </p></div>

                    <div class="show-with-full"><p>Melakwa Lake was my first favorite hike in WA after venturing past Si/Tiger many years ago and is still on the list.   Grande variation of scenes: I-90 from hundreds of feet below, Denny Water Slide, time in woods, two different cliff lined valleys, waterfall, several uphill climbs, and of course two gorgeous Lakes.   Do not skip going to the second lake; it's a short walk along the near shore of the first lake.</p>
<p>This trail does get wildly crowded so if you go on weekends, go very very early.  </p>
<p>It can be extended by either continuing upward from the second lake to Melakwa Pass with a view northward and down into Snow Lake.  Just head to the grove of trees above and traverse thru them along the creek bed that runs down the middle.  Then head for the rock prow up ahead and go to the left of it until you see a dirt trail into the woods that takes you the rest of the way. I've done that several times in the past.</p>
<p>Today, I took the climbing route to Kaleetan Peak with the plan of just going as far as either a technical area or the portion where you drop down right before that.  I was surprised how far you can go on a dirt climbers path.  Follow the toilet sign from the day area, and at the second sign just continue upwards and along the ridge towards the peak.    Not much views at first but then broke out into a long boulder field with dirt trail thru the heather growing along it.  Got to the peak that had a huge 3 foot cairn built.  The trail after that drops down, crosses a boulder field, and then climbs up to the summit.   From the high spot just past the huge cairn, I had a 340 degree view, blocked only by Kaleetan Peak itself.  Could see Defiance, Granite, Rampart, Kendall garden, Lake Keechelus, Glacier, Rainier.  The climber route reminded me of Snoqualmie Mountain.   Last Water was at Melakwa.</p>
<p>On the way back, took the turnoff and dropped down to the secluded waterfall on the way back and took a dip.</p></div>

                    <div class="show-with-full"><p>This makes for a nice trip just a ways out of Skykomish. The hike itself is well maintained, and the road leading up to the hike is sort of bumpy, but every vehicle should be able to handle it. The parking is somewhat limited at the trailhead, but this doesn't seem to be too popular of a hike, so I wouldn't worry too much about parking availability. The hike offers some nice glimpses out of the trees at the surrounding peaks, and you get some great views of the mountains from the top of Sunrise peak, about 2 miles in. We decided to turn around at that point, but it looks like a wonderful hike if you continue on, and I am excited to return in the future! This is a bit of a steep hike, but definitely an enjoyable one, especially before it gets snowed in.</p></div>

                    <div class="show-with-full"><p>What a beautiful and lonely backpack. If you're seeking solitude this is for you! I did not see another soul while on this 20+ mile trip. Lake Augusta is beautiful. Only animals will give you company. I awoke to several yelps in the night as creatures sniffed about. My experience of the bugs was not so bad given the wind. </p>
<p>Nature is reclaiming the trail. This is particularly true for the Badlands trail, which repeatedly disappears, requiring both determination and route-finding skills. The Painter Creek trail is also quite overgrown. After leaving Painter Creek, the route climbs a steep ridge but the trail does not exist. I managed to get lost and added several miles of bushwacking to my day. Thankfully, following the mountain topography got me back on track. Bring a map and compass for this one! </p>
<p>You will hike through an recent forest fire from 2014 so the trip at times has an eerie yet serene feel. You can watch nature rejuvenating itself. Consider saving this hike for another day if there's lots of wind in the weather forecast as you will travel many miles through burned snags prone to falling.</p></div>

The overlook of Salmon Creek is quite pretty, and the trail down to creekside is quite steep. Morgan Creek is much more accessible in several places, and almost nicer to look upon in the right lighting.</p>
<p>There are lots of birds, and aquatic wildlife in the creeks, and just a few mosquitos. Many spiders hang out in the underbrush, and there are some impressive webs if you look closely.</p>

                    <div class="show-with-full"><p>Ethan &amp; I decided to beat the Yakima heat with another hike to Mt Rainier today.  This time we decided on Panorama Point.  We arrived at Paradise around 10:00 and did not have any problem finding a parking space.  We climbed the Skyline Loop Trail clockwise with a short detour to Glacier Vista, then on up to Panorama Point.  As reported earlier, the Skyline Shortcut is closed due to a dangerous snowfield, so we continued up beyond Panorama Point to the first knoll with an unobstructed view of Mt Rainier for lunch.  After an hour or so we continued on the Skyline Loop around to the Golden Gate Trail, which we followed back to Paradise.  The day was clear when we started, but about 12:30 some very interesting high clouds started moving through.  The day was warm and breezy with no bugs - perfect hiking weather.  There were lots of others on the trail, but not the hoards of a weekend, except perhaps at a distance on the snowfields leading to &amp; from Camp Muir.  As Ethan said, retirement has its perks.  The wildflowers were very nice and the views were magnificent.</p></div>

                    <div class="show-with-full"><p>Probably the most popular trail in the park, and with good reason—it gets you halfway up Rainier. We went mid-week, arrived shortly after noon, and were able to get parking in the lowest Paradise lot. We hiked clockwise on a sunny day to maximize our views of the mountain. If you look like you know what you’re doing, be prepared to answer friendly questions from folks who’ve gotten into more than they expected. The trail is paved a good way up, and I think this suckers some folks in. There were hordes of people until Panorama Point, where a park volunteer was stationed and most people seemed to turn around. The lower skyline path is dangerous and closed, as seems usual. The top of the high skyline loop is a great place to stop for a bite, some rest, and admire the mountain. Most people who kept going after that seemed to take the Golden Gate turnoff—once we passed that we only met a handful of folks doing the full loop. The trail traffic picks up once Golden Gate rejoins the trail, and even more once you hit Myrtle Falls. Plenty of marmots and a few greedy chipmunks along the trail. No larger wildlife, though we did spot a few mountain goat prints so keep your eyes open. Trek poles were incredibly helpful for the steep bits and the places where snow is still in the trail.</p></div>

                    <div class="show-with-full"><p>I've avoided this trail due to its popularity, but decided with family in town to give it a try.  If you've been waiting as well, pick a weekday and make it happen.  This is one of the most impressive hikes for such little work (not easy, but doable for people in moderate physical condition).</p>
<p>We started late, leaving West Seattle around 9:30 and hiking at 11:45.  Parking lot was not even close to full.  As we were driving, I thought about an audible to Heather Lake instead.  But pretty quickly, we were above those low clouds.  This made for a very unique hiking experience.  As we headed upward and the day warmed up, the clouds slowly began to clear.  By the time we made it to the lookout, they were starting to break up enough to see all around, and by the time we were on the way down, the entire scenery was visible.</p>
<p>This gradual exposure made the whole hike that much more interesting; around every turn the views were better, and the hike down gave us different views from the hike up.  We took our time and ate lunch on the way up and it took about 2.5 hours on the way up.  We spent about 30 minutes at the top, then a bit under 2 hours on the way down.</p>
<p>The road has a lot of large potholes, so take it slow and you should be fine in any vehicle (we were in a minivan).  </p></div>

Quickly used the facilities (thumbs up), looked at the history information and admired the bright red railroad car (goat logo!) and then hit the trail. The parking lot was empty. We passed one hiker heading out.</p>
<p>So much history and remnants, like a trail of bread crumbs that lead you along this forested march. The tunnels and concrete walls stand as old silent giants. The smell of creosote and wood floats off the bridge. The deeper cave like tunnels send out their cool, musky breezes. </p>
<p>We did 2 miles and then had to turn around as it was getting late. Thank you to all who worked on this. Fantastic! :)</p>

                    <div class="show-with-full"><p>Arriving at the trailhead at 9am for a mid-week trip to Van Trump I found the small roadside parking lot already full, and many of the shoulder spots across the road were filling in too. I parked a short distance up the road at the Christine Falls pull-out and easily walked down to the trailhead.</p>
<p>As well described in other reports the good trail - rough in places - is mostly up and up. For me, Comet Falls is the highlight of the trip. The meadows up at Van Trump are very nice, but there are many places in the MRNP where one can enjoy such meadows... but then there's Comet. Could it be the highest waterfall (nearly 400') of its type in the park..?</p>
<p>Once at Van Trump I headed up the path above the maintained trail to the last trees for lunch with a view and a nap in the breeze. Watched a marmot flatten itself out in a nearby snowpatch to cool off from the sun. Meanwhile a nanny and kid mountain goat grazed along in the green the slopes high above.</p>
<p>Nice day...</p></div>

                    <div class="show-with-full"><p>First time ever hiking the loop. I started pretty early, about 5:30, hiking from Artist Point. From there I hiked down to Heather Meadows and up the saddle from there. I did this because I'd rather get the elevation change done early in the day before it gets hot and then play in the lakes and snow once the sun is overhead. My plan worked pretty well and I'd recommend going that way. The trails are all great and the still pools of water scattered around we're beautiful in the early morning light. Chain lakes were nice, I tried to hike around them but none of them seemed circumnavigable. I made it mostly around Hayes and Mazama. Iceberg lake was true to it's name and had an chunk of ice floating in the middle if it, though I doubt it will last long in this heat. There were mosquitos at these lakes, so be prepared for that. </p>
<p>Once back to the parking lot I extended my hike to Huntoon Point where there was an easy trail to follow, pools of water to explore and rocks to climb on. Also, this area is super popular so you probably won't have it to yourself. </p>
<p>All in all it was about 10.5 miles and I was back to my car around 12:30. </p></div>

                    <div class="show-with-full"><p>It was a beautiful day to be out at Denny Creek.  We just hiked the 1 mile to the rock water slide area, enjoyed the cool water, ate lunch and then went back.  </p>
<p>We've been here before and it's always a nice hike.  Though a weekday, plenty of families were out - though it didn't feel claustrophobic.</p>
<p>My only difficulty was that I forgot my America the Beautiful pass in my car (my daughter drove) and without cash or check on hand, we had to jump through some frustrating hoops to pay to park.  Wish the Forest Service could work with digital purchases! </p>

                    <div class="show-with-full"><p>I have spent the better part of 3 years training for this climb. My documentary crew has been following me though endless hours, days, months of cryotherapy, altitude training, and psychological isolation in order to give the world a glimpse into the power and fury it takes to tackle Mt. Si, unanimously agreed to be the most technically challenging and dangerous climb in the Western Hemisphere. </p>
<p>My doc crew and I arrived on the morning of Aug 1, the parking lot was dreary, dark, speckled with cars whose owners probably laid dead and forgotten in the cliffs above. We set up base camp just next to the water fountain and established comms, distributed resources, and it was time to climb. </p>
<p>The first mile posed formidable challenges. Some parts of the trail had rocks sticking out of the ground that you had to step around, I even saw a few roots protruding from the ground, a lethal combination of barely visible, yet tall enough to end your journey if tripped over. At one point at the mile turn, I saw a spider. So we set up camp for the night. </p>
<p>The next morning, to my delight, the spider had moved on, but there appeared to be a breeze, which posed a hypothermia threat that could not be addressed with anything less than full precaution. I duct taped my space blanket around my outer appendages, and then had to move off of the trail, a runner had blazed by and wished us good morning. My crew and I stared at one another, agog at the intrepidation of this legend, blazing his way up the mountain unaccompanied. </p>
<p> The biggest challenge came around mile 3 when I dropped my sandwich. It was utterly inedible. Panic set in, so I set up camp, making sure there were no spiders  by pacing around in increasingly wide arcs with balled fists, growling “Spidey, spidey, PLEASE GET OUT”. It appeared to work. </p>
<p>The next morning we pushed for the summit after briefly consulting our comms down by the bathroom and water fountain. The biggest problem at the final stretch was that I got tired. Not like sleepy tired, but I was breathing pretty hard, which made me feel weird. I bivy sacked myself right at the balcony, making sure I was at an angle that allowed for dramatic portraits of my face and Mt. Rainier in the background. </p>
<p>Looking around, I saw some true legends with their dog, eating a power bar and a ham sandwich, no support crew, no bivy sack, true wild men. I warned them that they were not only risking their lives, but the lives of rescuers. They only considered me briefly before moving to another location, seemingly frightened and intimidated by my intensity. </p>
<p>At this point, I took off my shoes. I almost had a blister on my left heel and I DID have a little one on my right heel. I immediately called for the rescue chopper, and laid with my bare feet elevated, arms over my eyes in exhaustion and pain. The chopper arrived, talked briefly with my doc crew as I readied myself for extraction. The EMT ran up to me, spat in my face, and kicked me in the ribs and verbally berated me and insulted my family and referred to me as an anatomical component that I am not comfortable repeating. </p>
<p>I am now home, and recovering from my blisters, and my legs got a little sore which has been really annoying. Not having that sandwich really hurt, and maybe tainted my review of the trail. If you’re interested in pre-ordering the documentary, please leave me a comment. It’s been quite the journey. If you’re gonna attempt this climb, please don’t be like these maniacs who go up there in day packs with their dogs. We’re talkin spiders, flies, rocks, trees everywhere... it’s a wild one. Have fun, I hope you make it like I did! </p></div>

                    <div class="show-with-full"><p>For my annual Paradise hike I decided to take the path less travelled. I parked in the lower parking lot of the former Jackson Visitor Center. It was 0930 and there were several spots available. I started out on the Dead Horse Crk. Trail that eventually hooks up with the Skyline Trail near Glacier Vista. The paved trail was steep but quiet. There were wildflowers in the meadows but not as abundant as I remembered. I hooked up with the Skyline Trail and encountered more hikers. Once past Glacier Vista and at the start of the ascent to Panorama Point the crowds thinned. I took the Pebble Creek Trail at the junction leaving more hikers heading east to Pan Pt. I took a break once on the Upper Skyline Trail admiring the Mountain and cool breeze keeping the bugs away. I could see across the way people ambling around Pan Pt. The snowfield descending the Lower Skyline Trail looked steep and impassable but there were two groups of future climbers practicing their self arrests on them! I dropped down to the Golden Gate junction and descended into Edith Creek Basin heading back to Paradise. I took the trail just above Paradise marked as the Waterfall Trail which would lead me back to Deadhorse Crk. Trail. Once again the trail was quiet probably because it headed uphill past a small trickle of a “waterfall.” After steep descent back to the parking lot I opted to add the Nisqually Vista loop to my trek. There were nicer flowers meadows with the mountain as a backdrop along this trail than above Paradise. </p></div>

                    <div class="show-with-full"><p>We began at the north end of Bagley Lakes and did the route counter clockwise along the northwest side of the lakes and the switchbacks leading up to the Herman Saddle. From here the views include Mount Herman, Mount Shuksan, the Mazama Dome, Table Mountain, Iceberg Lake and Mount Baker. When we began the descent there were several short snow fields to cross. Trekking poles helped from having unplanned glisades. When the trail leveled out we checked out the dark blue Hayes Lake and then had lunch near the shore of Iceberg Lake and witnessed a small ice berg calving off the ice on the north shore.</p>
<p>After lunch we continued on past Mazama Lake and then the climb up to the point where the Ptarmigan Ridge trail junction is. Here Mount Shuksan was startlingly clear after the hazy view we had in the morning from the Herman Saddle. From Artist Point it was difficult to find the Wild Goose trail because of the snow. Even though it begins to the right of the restroom it was easier to spot from a perch to the left.</p>
<p>It was a near perfect or just plain perfect day up there, clear skies with a few small clouds for accent and a cooling breeze that kept the bugs at bay.</p></div>

                    <div class="show-with-full"><p>We kicked off Hike-A-Thon with a group hike between our two teams at Brightwater today. We stuck to the mostly shady north-side trails since it was a warm, sunny afternoon, clocking 1.5 miles for kids and moms. At the end we stopped by the creek in the northwest corner to go "fishing" with sticks. Two kids ended up taking a swim, mine included of course. It is about waist deep on a tall four year old at the deepest point. Very few bugs, lots of goose poop. These are some nice, easy, convenient trails..the only downside is the constant highway noise since it is wedged between route 9 and 522. <br /><br />This summer, my four-year-old son and I are hiking to raise money for Washington Trails Association. Please consider donating to one of our Hike-A-Thons at the below links. Thank you and Happy Hiking!</p></div>

                    <div class="show-with-full"><p>Our group of Hike-a-Thoners and WTA staff enjoyed a lovely before work hike at Discovery Park to celebrate the beginning of Hike-a-Thon! Many in our group drove to the trailhead, but I opted for public transit from the Eastside to get to Discovery Park. While it did take a little longer for me to arrive, I otherwise had the cool, crisp morning ride to reflect on the past month and all that August has in store.</p>
<p>The trail is in top condition and suitable for any hiker. A couple of uphill and downhill sections helped to break any monotony that may have formed during the walk, but nothing strenuous at all! The low clouds and light drizzle did obscure our views, but I know our group was very happy to have a reprieve from the relentless sun and heat we've had as of recent. The mist gently cooling ourselves as we walked was a very welcome surprise and made the hike just that much better!</p>
<p>With Hike-a-Thon in full swing now, don't be surprised if you see many purple shirts cruising up and down trails all across the state, working as one big community to improve our trails and public lands! If you would like to learn more, visit wta.org/hikeathon and if you would like to make a donation to the campaign, you can do so through my campaign, if you wish, at give.wta.org/weredoinit</p>
<p>Happy Hike-a-Thon ya'll!</p></div>

                    <div class="show-with-full"><p>We parked at Yellow Aster Butte since we didn't want to risk a flat. The road walk up to twin lakes is no joke...over 2 miles and we clocked it at 1,600' elevation gain. It is steep, and that's something we didn't anticipate since the other trail reports don't mention it. </p>
<p>We took a short break at the lakes before hiking Winchester. There is a downed tree on the trail, and since there's no way under it we (and other people it seems) went around, which isn't the best for the vegetation! Other than that the trail is in pretty good condition, if a little overgrown.</p>
<p>Another thing to note: WTA marks this trail as 3.4 miles round-trip, but the trailhead marks it as 2.1 miles one-way, making it 4.2 round-trip. Just something to consider!</p>
<p>Very beautiful hike overall, but do wish we were more prepared for how steep the road walk was. </p></div>

                    <div class="show-with-full"><p>I actually only went from the SmithBrook Road trail head to Grizzly Peak.</p>
<p>No snow on trail, 4 major trees down on trail, but all easy to navigate for a hiker. All passable by stock but not easily. Not dangerous, but not easily.</p>
<p>The bugs were awful, but my permethrin-treated  clothes seemed to do the trick for everything except for the biting flies that were size of a quarter. 40% DEET ( which I applied after those flies woke up )  plus my treated clothes  couldn’t detour those suckers.</p>
<p>I would like to take a moment and comment on the trail head here. I’ve hiked many sections of Washington’s PCT, and this is the dirtiest PCT trail head I have ever encountered. As it is my first visit, I do not know if this is usual? Toilet paper blooms were everywhere, not just scattered around the parking lot, but also for the first few switchbacks of the trail. Gatorade bottles, water bottles, Plastic doggie poopie bags filled with poop,miscellaneous other trash, all scattered along the trail for ~1/8 mi. </p>
<p>I picked up what I could carry down the trail.</p>
<p>Also, when I returned to my vehicle, I found the cover to my gas tank pried wide-open. (No gas lost, like most modern vehicles, I have anti-siphon.)</p>
<p>Hopefully I just happened upon it at a bad time, and this is not typical of this trail head. That would be really sad. LNT people, LNT.</p></div>

Not my favorite of the ten or so multi-nighters we've done. Definitely works better as a day hike than an overnighter. The entire shoreline is either rock or dense trees, so it's impossible to actually camp on the lake. The closest you can get involves a layer of forest between you and the lake. The day hikes up to the ridge line are heavily bouldered and slow going, took us six hours out and back to scale the ridges near Rennie Peak. Reynolds Peak is impossible to reach from here as far as I could tell. On the more positive, it is a lovely lake. Makes for a nice, cold swim. There's a privy near the established campsites, which is quite convenient. The hike up itself is easy to navigate and clearly marked. You can make your way up to a second lake by following the waterfall at the far end of Louis. We enjoyed a previous trip to nearby Scatter Lake much more, though that is the most difficult, strenuous hike we've ever done and damn near killed the lot of us.</p></div>

                    <div class="show-with-full"><p>First, I hope someone can change the heading for this hike -- it is NOT on the Mountain Loop Highway, it is on the Suiattle River Road, which you turn on to from the road between Darrington and Highway 20.</p>
<p>I have no comments about the hike, which has been one of my favorites since 1974. The only difference is that the last time I was on top there was no lookout, just a concrete slab. They've built a wonderful lookout on the site; it's currently staffed by a couple of high school-aged volunteers who happily answer any of your questions. We could see smoke from two, possibly three forest fires today.</p>
<p>I do want to comment on the road. I have a 1993 Geo Prizm, and I made it up to the trail head and back and only scraped over a single rock that was hiding in a line a grass growing down the middle of FR 2680. But I won't take my car up there again. In order to avoid the craters and serious scrub board on FR 26 and the craters and scrub board and rocks of various sizes on FR 2680, you've got to slow down considerably for the entire distance. It's one thing if you have a low-clearance beater that you only use for driving to trail heads, but if you have a low-clearance vehicle that you care about, I'd leave it home.</p>
<p>Try to borrow a car or organize a trip with a friend who has a high-clearance rig, 'cuz Green Mountain is a great hike.</p>

                    <div class="show-with-full"><p>This one had been on my to-do list for 2 years, having done the Norway Pass/Independence Pass viewpoint previously. My expectations were completely met and I highly recommend this hike. Not too much to say, WTA described it perfectly. No real issues with the trail, bugs minimal, weather perfect. The wildflowers the last two miles before and at Mount Margaret are incredible and everywhere. I was surprised given it's now August but they are going strong. The views of St Helens, Adams, and Rainier are wonderful. Enjoyed getting a higher view from the summit of Spirit Lake and the blast side of the crater. Anyone planning to camp, water source is still very plentiful at bear camp.</p></div>

                    <div class="show-with-full"><p>Hiked to Lake Valhalla from the Smithbrook trailhead.  The trail was in good condition the whole way.  There were just a few rocks, tree roots, etc. to deal with.  Our geezer patrol had no difficulties.</p>
<p>There was some haze, but we could still see distant, snow-capped peaks.  They just didn't show up in our photographs.</p>
<p>The bugs were nasty, biting through clothes, and even through DEET sometimes.  Amazingly, they were less severe at the lake than elsewhere.  Maybe it was the fish jumping up and catching them.  Go fish!!!</p>
<p>Minimal bird activity this late in the season.  Heard a couple of marmots, though.</p>
<p>The wildflowers in the meadow near the lake were lovely.  There were also large patches of bright pink heather in other areas.  There were whole hillsides full of huckleberry bushes, but only saw a single berry.</p>
<p>Two of us did the Mt. McCausland side trail.  It was very steep and difficult, with some scrambling over large rocks at the top.  The views were worth it!</p>
<p>It would be REALLY NICE if we could have a toilet at the trailhead.  The nearby bushes are getting pretty nasty.</p></div>

                    <div class="show-with-full"><p>Hiked to Otter Falls today.  I debated this prior to starting because I expected that the "falls" would have little water running down it.  While this did, indeed, turn out to be the case, I still found the trip pleasant and the rock face of the waterfall, with its streaks of color and darkened (wet) areas reflected in the lake below, to be interesting.  I will have to come back during the spring runnoff to see what it looks like with a significant flow.</p>
<p>For the most part, the trail is an easy uphill grade all the way to the turnoff for the falls.  While much of the trail is smooth, there are some rocky sections and some places that pass over rockfalls.  The trail passes through second growth forests, so there was plenty of shade to keep me cool.  There are not many breaks in the canopy to view the surrounding area, and only a few places where the river is close enough to stop and enjoy, but there were plenty of the nice views off into the woods that I enjoy.  Green and mossy.</p>
<p>As others have pointed out, the turnoff for Otter Falls is not officially marked, but people have left stones in the shape of an arrow (and currently a pink ribbon) to mark the spot.  Beyond this spot there is only a boot path up the hillside to a ridgeline.  It's not as clear as a real trail, but easy enough to follow.  From the ridgeline there is a short, but steep, path down to the lakeshore.  There is also a down log at the ridgline that made a perfect place to take a break, eat lunch and leave my pack before scrambling down to the lake.  </p>
<p>The salmonberries were gone, but I did see a few thimbleberries, red elderberries (not good to eat) and a very few huckleberries, both red and blue.</p>
<p>This was my first time to this destination and I started out at the wrong spot.  I parked at the Taylor River trailhead, thinking the trail started there.  Instead it added a half mile (going and coming) to reach the true Snoqualmie Lake trailhead/parking lot.  Oh, well.  I got an extra mile's worth of "steps."</p></div>

                    <div class="show-with-full"><p>This is a nice hike but there is a big obstacle to face right away and that is the road leading to the trailhead. You start out on Smithbrook Road, FR 67. The road is rocky with a few deep potholes. This section is doable. After about 6 miles on this road, you reach a fork in the road. Go right and follow this road about 3.5 miles further to the trailhead. This stretch of the road requires a driver who doesn't object to their truck or car getting scratched by overgrown trees and bushes. The road itself is in good shape but the small trees and bushes aligning the narrow road will slap your vehicle silly. Once at the trailhead, you'll feel a sense of accomplishment if your car doesn't need a new paint job.</p>
<p>The trail starts out on nice level ground. The creek and woods are lovely. Further along there are a couple of sections where it becomes very bushy. Just push through it as it is not difficult, just a bit annoying. The trail begins to climb slightly and in about 2-2.5 miles you reach a pretty meadow. From this point the trail gets steep as it enters into the forest. Eventually the trail opens up to a pleasant hillside where well built switchbacks lead to a gap and junction. You have the choice of descending down to Rock Lake or continuing on to the lookout on Rock Mountain. </p>
<p>The views were great despite a haze in the air. There was a fire occurring in the northeast direction which was very sad to see. </p>
<p>On the way up 2 goats were seen in the distance, each one in different locations. There were nice wildflowers along the trail and in the meadows. Bugs were a nuisance, typical for this time of year. Saw no other people on the trail today. Stats: just under 10 miles, elevation gain 3250 ft and elevation 6850 ft.</p></div>

                    <div class="show-with-full"><p>Walking from the prescribed trail head is a section of private road. I'm hoping there's easement access. So, we ventured down Grand Ridge Dr and found the Grand Ridge trail crossing. The Water Tower loop is to your left. We started the trail around 7:45 pm, so it was getting quite dark once we were finally finishing. Makes it feel like summer is quickly coming to an end! I would do it again though, for the beautiful sunset and glowing trees. My husband was beginning to get a little nervous though. But I'm glad we got out for the first day of this year's Hike-a-thon!</p>

                    <div class="show-with-full"><p>The Map app on my iPhone said to walk the gravel road so it didn't take as long to get there as it said. Although the road is in very rough shape, it was navigable with our Subaru Forester. On the way back down, there were 2 separate incidents of vehicles (a Jeep and a sedan) stuck in ditches being winched out by Jeeps. (Jeeps owners seem to love that road.)</p>
<p>The trail is in fine shape and typical Pacific NW fare. The views start getting good just before the lake. The trail around the lake and up to Summit Lake Peak are a must - killer views of Rainier. The lake seems to be a popular camping destination but also a fair number of day hikers. Horse flies were annoying but didn't bite. Some biting black flies but no mosquitoes (yay). It was nice to take a super refreshing dip in the lake before heading back out of the wilderness.</p></div>

We parked on NE Harrison Dr. and walked down Grand Ridge Dr. to the trail where we went right.  It was green, we saw some big trees, and got some exercise.</p></div>

<p>The FS road up to the trailhead is your standard FS road. Potholes. Any vehicle can handle the road up, however. It is a 12 mile road, so it will take you about 40 minutes.</p>
<p>Six vehicles in the lot at 7am. </p>
<p>The first 2 or so miles is non-stop elevation gain through forest cover, which was great considering it was hot and sunny.</p>
<p>After coming onto the first knoll, epic views begin. Each knoll brings more glorious views. I passed several areas that would be great campsites. Two were occupied. Jealous. </p>
<p>Mosquitoes were everywhere, and the farther along I got, those huge demon flies from Heck appeared. I used 40% Deet several times, but the demon flies just laughed. No bites, as I kept moving. </p>
<p>This is a dry trail - bring water. Much of it is out in the open with no shade, so take precautions. </p>
<p>On the way back to the truck, it became a Conga line of people coming up. On a Tuesday. I cannot imagine what a weekend is like.</p>
<p>ZERO trash or waste observed, the entire way out and back. None. Kudos to you hikers!</p>
<p>Epic day. Sore feet but blissfully happy.</p>
<p>Work tomorrow. Sigh.</p></div>

                    <div class="show-with-full"><p>We intended to do the classic through hike starting at Snowgrass Flats to Cispus Basin ending at Walupt Lake, but arrived at Walupt Lake much later than planned and ended up suduced by the gorgoues lake on a hot day and spent the day and night at Walupt Lake (from what I could tell, its pretty much all car camping, not the back country scene). We did the counter clockwise out and back starting at Nannie Ridge (yes, the elevation is better experienced as a decent, I know). The peak has nice views of Mt. Adams though, though it was quite hazy thanks to wildfires). Continued on to sheep lake which was a great place to have lunch and swim (didn’t encounter another soul on Monday), though the bugs were bad as everyone reports. Full DEET is the way to go. Continued on to Cispus Pass and Basin - strikingly beautiful wildflowers abound, gorgeous rock formations, etc. Cispus Basin is incredible; again the views were hazy which was a bummer but so  much to see all around. Hiked out the next day. I definitely recommend doing the hike as the clockwise through hike as folks suggest (not what we did, though it was very enjoyable still). Will definitely do the day hike to Old Snowy Mountain next time. </p></div>

                    <div class="show-with-full"><p>We got to the trail head around 3:30 pm and there was only one other car there, so we had a solitary hike the whole way up. The new sign for the turn off to Sawyer Mountain is on the right side of the trail opposite the cairn. It was right about 2 miles in. Very easy hike to this point, not much up or down and lovely path through the woods. From the cairn turnoff it was about 1 mile to the top of Sawyer Mount, through beautiful blooming wildflowers and brush. It is very steep right when you take off from the cairn, but then steadies out to a moderate climb with beautiful views of Hinman and Daniel peaks. After a few switch backs you crest the top and then it is about 0.2 miles through heavy brush around to the peak. We decided to camp up at the peak as it was supposed to be a mild evening of weather and we didn’t want to rush the beat the sunset to set up camp at the pass. There was just enough room for our 2 person dome tent. If you don’t want to camp at the top you have to go back down 1 mile to rejoin the trail at the cairn turn off, then it is another mile to Sawyer pass where there are more established campsites. We got beautiful sunset views, especially with the smoke from the wildfires making the sun super red as it set. We had clear views at the top, and we could see the plume of smoke from the nearest wildfire to the northeast. You can see Mt. Baker to the north and just glimpse the top of Mt. Rainer between peaks to the South. The bugs were annoying on the way up, but as long as you keep moving you don’t notice them. We sprayed ourselves down the OFF multiple times. The bugs were down right terrible when we were cooking dinner in the evening. If you’re planning on being out there in the evening, I would highly recommend a head bug net, it made a huge difference! Altogether a beautiful well maintained trail with less traffic than the surrounding lake trails.</p></div>

The trail is in a lot worse condition than years past, with a lot of exposed roots and a few trees across the trail.  The parking lot was about half full when we started at 10a on Wednesday and full at 3p when we returned after spending a couple hours up at the lake.  This moderately easy hike is a favorite we try to do every year.  The blue huckleberries were in full swing, as were some thimbleberries. My son had a pocketful on his way down.  We hiked with nine children ages 6-11, three moms, and one grandma.  All made it without any problem.</span></p></div>

                    <div class="show-with-full"><p>Few small potholes on Road 9031 but you can easily manage with any car. The trails are in part shade and part sun exposure. Ira Spring trail stars with a small incline and pretty wide but soon the trail becomes steeper and narrow. The trail to Bandera Mountain is straight up and you are almost scrambling up the rocky trail. I was able to see Mount Rainier (Picture 1). Channel your mountain goat spirit coming down the rocky trail from Bandera. I made it to the top in 2 hours so I decided to go up Mount Defiance also.  </p>
<p>When you are back on Ira Spring trail, you go down a 100 feet or so to reach the Mason Lake (Picture 2). Its about 2 miles and 1500 feet of elevation gain from the lake to the summit of Mount Defiance. If you have 2 to 3 hours more hiking in you, you will be rewarded with some amazing views (Picture 3).</p></div>

                    <div class="show-with-full"><p>Love this hike.  Started at 10:45am on this Wednesday.  Parking lot was about 1/2 full.  Temperature was in low 60s at start and low 70's at end.  Sky was clear and sunny.  Hiking traffic was light, though there were 11-12 people at the fire lookout at 1:15pm.  Mt. Ranier was visible, but in a bit of a haze which may have been partly smoke (from CA and OR fires) and/or partly low clouds from on-shore winds.  Views to the north, east and west were pretty clear and magnificent as usual.  Trail was in excellent shape, but dry/dusty.  Alpine flowers were limited as season may have passed.  Pond near the summit was almost dry, so need to carry enough water.  I went thru 2.5 liters.  Elapsed times: 2h 30m up; 1h 35m down.</p></div>

                    <div class="show-with-full"><p>Managed to climb above the clouds today at Sauk Mountain. We were the second car in the parking lot at 8:30, road is generally passable with the exception of one gnarly potholed turn shortly before the parking lot. Low clearance vehicles may wish to park off the side of the road rather than manage this area. Thankfully, it wouldn't add too much extra to the hiking distance.<br /><br />I love this hike for wildflowers, it is know for the amazing variety and sheer abundance of flowers if you catch it at the right time. Lots of wildflowers blooming right now, some have peaked, but many are just getting started at the higher elevations. The wildflowers compete for stunning views on all sides, this date the river valley was flooded with low-lying clouds, but all mountains were viewable above the fog. </p>
<p>Trail is in good condition; there is still one large snowfield on the upper trail, easy enough to cross, and a couple areas where there is erosion on the trail near where people have been cutting switchbacks, manageable. Bring lots of sun protection, as this entire hike is exposed. However, if you plan your hike early enough in the day, you can easily manage to climb the endless switchbacks in the early-morning shade of the mountain. </p>
<p>We saw many pikas, a couple of marmots, several chipmunks, and at least 5 varieties of butterflies along the trail. Bugs were not too bad, bug spray managed the bulk of the mosquitoes and other bugs with the exception of one super-persistant biting fly.</p>
<p>Wonderful day on trail! #hikeathon</p>

The smokey haze we've been having from the fires made it hard to see the far peaks but Mt Rainier was a beautiful sight all on its own. The trail is in great condition and wasn't as busy as I had expected but it was a weekday so that always keeps crowds down. Bugs weren't really an issue. I saw a handful of black flies but no mosquitos on the hike. Wonderful day hike with a great effort to reward ratio. The fire lookout was fun to explore and the views were astounding.</p></div>

                    <div class="show-with-full"><p>Got to the trailhead around 10 and nabbed the last parking spot, but when we left there were people parked along the side of the road, so it's nice to know that's an option.  </p>
<p>The trail on the way up was pretty and not crowded at all, but there were A LOT of people at the creek crossing.  </p>
<p>We continued up to the first falls, but since we had a dog on a hot day and there wasn't any shade on the second half, we turned back.  Also, the only spot where water can be reached this time of year is the creek crossing, so it's not as good of a fluffy-dog-on-a-hot-day hike as it may seem (don't worry, I bring lots of water for the dog to drink and to pour over him just in case, but I try to choose trails where he can splash around).</p>
<p>We passed a bunch of people on the way back to the car, including some big groups, and there was some construction on the overpass that was pretty noisy, so the trip back wasn't quite as pleasant.</p>
<p>Overall a nice, easy hike, and I look forward to going back on a drizzly day when it's hopefully not as crowded.</p></div>

                    <div class="show-with-full"><p>What a thigh burner with 4100ft elevation gain!  I've included 6min of video highlights below..</p>
<p>Bugs: both mosquitos and small biting black flies.  Deet worked on mosquitos but only somewhat on the flies.  My new bug net for the head from REI was a lifesaver in the 3mi forest section, where most bugs were.</p>
<p>Trail: the last half mile before the first meadows were badly overgrown.  But in several places a work party has obviously started to tackle it - thank you!  On the 'unmaintained' trail to the summit, sure would be nice if the eroded spots after reaching the final steep meadows on the summit that have lost any tread got dug out a bit - hard to find safe footing on the steep sandy surface and would be deadly when wet.</p>
<p>Wildflowers: tiger lilies, white rhodies, paintbrush, lupine, spirea, phlox, heather, valerian, false helebore, pink &amp; yellow monkeyflowers, cow parsnip, bistort, and more I've forgotten!</p>
<p>Had the summit to myself for three hours - in fact only saw one couple of hikers all day, and they were coming up as I was heading down - meanwhile from the summit I could look down at the very crowded Yellow Aster Butte trailhead!</p>
<p>It was hazy, but could still see the Canada peaks and Mount Baker fairly well.  Astounding panoramas in every direction!  Nice flat round summit for hanging out - I did not hop over to the slightly higher pinnacle next door because of the exposure it has.</p></div>

                    <div class="show-with-full"><p>Geezer Patrol minus two found it a bit smokey for our early morning hump to Burroughs 2 and it will probably get worse with wildfire starting to bloom in Washington.  Hit the Sunrise lot at 0830 which is recommended as the dusty trail gets really busy shortly thereafter.</p>
<p>The only issue was the ever present horseflies, red head and black head that were quite aggressive and required a bit of force to murder.  I was momentarily knocked unconscious by my hiking partner who asked to me to stay still while he "took out a double" that had perched on my forehead.</p>
<p>Seemed like a Burroughs kind of day as 90% of the traffic headed that way.  The routes to Fremont, Skyscraper and Berkely Park were lightly used or untraveled.  Almost got tired of wishing g'day to all the folks on the way up as we headed back down.  Regardless, the proximity to The Mountain is almost overwhelming and worth all effort.  Also managed to see two goats at one of the north overlooks close to Sunrise.</p>
<p>Pretty easy day with 6 miles and 1100' gain.  The huckleberry ice cream at Wapiti Woolies in Greenwater is also worth the stop. $5 for two scoops!</p></div>

                    <div class="show-with-full"><p>What a lovely hike in Rainier's Paradise! Came on a Tuesday and was happy to see that getting to the parking lot around 10am, there was plenty of parking. We started off the day by spraying on TONS of bug spray and sunscreen, thinking we would be eaten alive. We really only needed the sunscreen it turns out. There were hardly any bugs! There were plenty of marmots along the trail, though. We went clockwise around the loop and were happy that we got the serious elevation out of the way in the beginning. This trail is well marked and maintained, but it's definitely not easy! We checked in with the rangers before starting and they reported this trail as 1700 ft of elevation gain, so it’s a bit more than WTA advertises. There is very little shade for the first half of the hike. I brought two waters and had to fill up in freshwater streams three times. Stunning views of Rainier greeted us along the way. There were waterfalls in the distance, and we even heard what sounded like a small avalanche on the other side of the mountain. My first opportunity to fill up water came at our first waterfall after most of the serious elevation gain, and it tasted great! It was clean, cold, and a lifesaver. </p>
<p>After reaching the top, our thighs were pleased for the break, and were treated to glorious views in every direction. We ate our lunch at the panorama view point, but if you're looking for shade, go up just a little past the bathroom and there are alcoves in the rock which are shaded. Watch out for chipmunks stealing your food! These guys are not shy. Since it was hazy (likely from the fires) it was not easy to see Mt St Helens, Hood, and Adams. On the way down, it gets a bit rockier, with more glacial views of Rainier. We chose to do the whole loop and passed Golden Gate, a shorter return route to the visitors center. Here , there are a few patches of snow that haven't quite melted. Some climbed over it carefully, I chose the fail-safe slide on your butt routine. It wasn't that difficult to make it across. It was fun for one of the ice patches, it formed a tunnel of ice which we crawled through. We continued along and found my second water fill up station, a fast moving river from ice run off that tasted wonderful. We continued our gradual descent we were pleased to see more wildflowers toward the end of the hike. Just before the visitors center, take photos on the bridge over a beautiful waterfall- this is one of the most gorgeous views of Rainier along the whole hike. </p>
<p>We got back to our car around 5. Finished the hike in six hours with many food, water, and photo breaks. Also spent time in the gift shop! Fun day!</p></div>

                    <div class="show-with-full"><p>I've been wanting to do this hike for a long time but it's a bit of a drive for such a short trail. We decided to combine this with the Big Four Ice Caves.</p>
<p>I was surprised that the trail starts out going down, but then it's a fairly steady uphill to get to the top. Parts of the trail are fairly eroded with many exposed roots and rocks. Otherwise, we made it to the top in about an hour and enjoyed lunch at the top looking at the mountains you can still see. We were surprised to be the only ones on the trail since the parking lot was fairly full but I guess everyone else went to Monte Cristo or Gothic Basin--that trailhead is across the street. </p>
<p>On the way down, we took the detour to the Railroad Grade--wise choice since we then avoided having to hike up at the end. The grade (not as well trodden--the blackberries are starting to grow over parts of the trail) is a straight shot back to the parking lot. </p>
<p>It was a hot day but most of the hike was in the shade so it made for an enjoyable hike. </p></div>

This over all hike took us about 4 1/2 hours, I am sure it is much easier starting at Samish over look or when the trail does not have a detour.</p></div>

                    <div class="show-with-full"><p>Briefly, since there have been no new TR’s for a while, here’s a quick report:</p>
<p>Spent two days and a night up near the Portals. Lots of snow. Used boots and poles mostly, but on a couple of occasions in the off trail areas added micro-spikes and an axe. For the main Ptarmigan Ridge trail the worst spot (in my opinion) comes right after the split from the Chain Lakes trail. The PtRT drops a couple hundred feet to get below a rock outcrop and you’ll have to traverse a long-lived snow field, which is quite steep and can be hard in the early hours. If you get past that without trouble the rest of the snow crossings should be manageable, though extensive. The plateau area to the south of Kiser (sometimes called 14 Goat Lake or something similar) is still mostly full of snow, though there are some good tent sites melted out. Snow-wise, the route to the top of the East Portal is no more difficult than the rest of the trail.</p>
<p>Saw many, many, many goats. The goats up at Baker are nicely wary of people and don’t follow you around or eat your socks or that kind of thing.</p>
<p>Bugs were pretty bad Tuesday but settled down Wednesday when temperatures dropped a bit. Biting flies, biting gnats during the day. At dawn and dusk: hordes of mosquitoes.</p>
<p>Probably because of the snow there weren’t too many people up on Ptarmigan. By comparison Chain Lakes trail and especially Table Mountain were very busy, even on a Wednesday. The (vast) Artist Point parking lot was mostly full at 2pm Wednesday.</p></div>

<p>Reached by 0930, multiple berries- Thimble berries, salmon berries, Marion berries, blue huckleberries and a blackish raspberry type- quite sweet.</p>
<p>Lots of flowers- Indian paintbrush, Columbines, Balsam, daisies and Spirea?</p>
<p>Started back by 1100 and met 3 'geezers club' hikers and then a lone hiker with his border collie mix.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Very enjoyable, bugs were kept at bay with a roll on anti bug spray but were not too bad, even at the lake</p></div>

                    <div class="show-with-full"><p>We started hiking about 9:15 on Tuesday and had no difficulty parking in the main lot.  It was a warm humid day and where there was no tree coverage on the trail it was very hot.  No bugs at the parking lot or along the trail.  At the lake there were flies but no one saw mosquitoes.  Most of our group swam in the main lake and two of us swam in the small lake which was much, much colder.  The trail up to the lake past the falls is rocky so we didn't save much time on the descent.  This is a beautiful area!</p></div>
